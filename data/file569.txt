5690005 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
5690006 most of the dead were young men aged between 18 and 20 they were in line waiting to enter the school for recruiting exams when they were mowed down by the blast
5690007 the car explosion destroyed part of the outer wall of the school and blew a huge crater into the ground about three meters yards from the main gate
5690008 we have to worry about the security situation now we should not play down the terrorist menace as the authorities are doing
5690009 tuesdays attack showed that they the rebels are well entrenched on the ground and seem to be able to hit significant targets

5690015 we dont have access to south ossetia so to have a full picture of the humanitarian impact of the conflict there is impossible at this time
5690016 one of our top priorities for when we are able to gain access were hoping following a meeting with mr lavrov that we will have access is to evaluate the state of medical care particularly for weapon wounded people
5690017 the high commissioner will again press for the protection of the civilian population especially those newly displaced and for safe and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations to the areas of displacement
5690018 the major concerns are ensuring safe food water and sanitation is provided to the displaced to prevent outbreaks of any communicable diseases as yet we have seen no reports of any communicable diseases outbreaks

5690023 the iphone 3g issues were device specific and nothing to do with the carriers networks
5690024 we suspect therefore that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
5690025 on some internet sites t mobile is cited as saying that we assign some problems with 3g reception to the apparatus itself this is not what we want to transmit fact remains however that there are iphone3g customers in both the netherlands and in other countries which find that the use experience on this apparatus is not sufficient we do not know the reason for this and for this reason do we there now intensive research nasty

5690031 this same pattern has been demonstrated in literally hundreds of studies around the world
5690032 a man who has status usually also has ambition intelligence and good social skills
5690033 to become financially and socially successful you need these other attributes
5690034 when it does happen its usually a clear case of trading you see the younger partner offering youth and physical appeal and the older partner financial stability which may be one way up the social ladder for the younger partner
5690035 i think 75 percent plus one vote is a great victory
5690036 the rest is irrelevant the cme was able to get a super majority as they presented a strong proposition

5690046 one of humanitys great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination
5690047 and therefore also to italy where sorry to say there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden

5690075 the most perfect in faith amongst believers is he who is best in manner and kindest to his wife
5690076 my lord agreed with me umar in three things and as regards the veiling of women i said o allahs apostle i wish you ordered your wives to cover themselves from the men because good and bad ones talk to them so the verse of the veiling of the women was revealled
5690077 when i first put on hijab my parents were shocked
5690078 but i found liberation in islam it gave me the confidence to insist on a good education and reject the arranged marriage islam made sense to me and i could understand it as opposed to what i had grown up with plus it was compatible with being british being a british muslim rather than pakistani
5690079 the koran says that men and women are equal in the eyes of god and that we are like a garment for each other to protect one another
5690080 i created you from one soul and from that soul i created its mate so that you may live in harmony and love
5690081 i am deeply grateful that my first ideas of god were formed by islam because i was able to think of the highest power as one without sex or race and thus completely unpatriarchal
5690082 i went to agadir on holiday returned with a fantastic tan but went back to work in a hijab
5690083 one moment you were a sex kitten the next youre all wrapped up she thought i was repressing myself i felt i had achieved liberation
5690084 the attention i got from the other sex changed instead of a sexual approach they had to take an interest in what was in my head and in my personality rather than my body sometimes when i flick through a fashion magazine i think of taking off the hijab but it passes quickly too many women exert power through their sexuality and thats degrading to women its a form of enslavement
5690085 when i read about the prophets life i feel it is unjust he favoured one wife over another and that makes me uneasy i havent found a scholar who can explain it but i believe in a just god and the wisdom of the prophet so i take it on trust thats faith to have real knowledge of islam is to study it for a long time eventually i might find an interpretation that satisfies me
5690086 usually the first wife doesnt satisfy them intellectually or sexually and they start to think of taking a second wife and i try to help them find solutions within their existing relationship
5690087 men are biologically designed to desire a plurality of women and will always do so
5690088 segregation has proved a spur in iran to employing more women for example
5690089 they now have quotas in the universities so women can be taught by women
5690090 the practice of early islam did not mean strict segregation and the historic record is of a more relaxed and open society
5690091 we need to go back to the islam of the golden age from the 7th to the 13th century

5690093 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5690094 to distort irans scientific achievements by portraying them as a military issue
5690095 enemies of the progress of the iranian nation have not spared any efforts to portray irans scientific technical and peaceful achievements as a military success
5690096 after testing the rocket tehran announced that it will take some time for iran to put a satellite into orbit with this rocket it means that iran still doesnt have the technology used by western countries
5690097 in the past similar words were said about irans nuclear capabilities therefore iran still at least with its latest rocket launch cannot enter a competition with countries like france or the eu in general the u s or even israel
5690098 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the u s from attacking its nuclear sites

5690108 the battle of long tan was very important because although it wasnt the longest or saw the most australians killed there was such fierce intense fighting over a period of a few hours
5690109 i think there has finally been closure for a lot of the diggers who fought in vietnam now that their awards have been upgraded to their original status
5690110 after 42 years theyve finally been recognised for their gallantry during contact
5690111 it is a day for the vietnam veterans so we can appreciate all they have done and thank them for their sacrifice
5690112 there are a lot of mixed feelings when you think about so long ago its hard to get your head around it at times it brings back memories some good and some not so good

5690126 no doubt an admirable and a bold step yet if at the end safe passage is given to musharraf it would demoralize the whole nation and also badly destroy the credibility of all the ruling partners
5690127 we write to you out of concern regarding recent actions taken by the department that may result in a further diminution of the nations public housing
5690128 in a letter dated july 2 2008 your staff informed us that since 2000 99 032 public housing units have been approved for demolition or disposition
5690129 public housing serves a vital need in communities across the country by providing much needed affordable housing especially for families with extremely low incomes and supportive services
5690130 a further decline in the number of public housing units exacerbates the affordable housing needs of our most vulnerable populations including the elderly and disabled and forced low income families into unstable or unsustainable housing situations or homelessness
5690131 therefore we are concerned that more and more housing authorities are choosing to relinquish their public housing stock and with it their responsibility to provide affordable housing to their communities
5690132 last year with the departments permission the san diego housing commission
5690133 although the families residing in these and other development that have been demolished or disposed receive housing choice vouchers we do not believe that the provision of such a voucher to a family compensates for the loss of a public housing unit to a community
5690134 public housing represents a commitment from the government that there will be a housing resource for our most vulnerable populations the private sector cannot make that commitment
5690135 like public housing housing choice vouchers are an important part of our nations affordable housing continuum however vouchers are not a permanent replacement for hard public housing units and the department should not treat them as such
5690136 unfortunately it appears that with huds cooperation housing authorities are turning to vouchers as a viable replacement for public housing units
5690137 due to the high number of pending applications and the clear need for legislative reform of the demolition disposition program we call on you to immediately cease approval of all demolition and disposition applications until legislation is enacted to reform this program
5690138 we look forward to working with you to implement this moratorium and to ensure that further public housing units are not lost sincerely maxine waters barney frank

5690185 in fast allen anderen eu staaten und dar ber hinaus ist es g ngige praxis spenden zu beg nstigen und nicht zu besteuern
5690186 nur in sterreich und finnland sieht man das nicht so

5690189 die einf hrung von aufkommensneutralen kosteuern in sterreich soll eine signalwirkung f r ein nachhaltiges klimabewusstes wirtschaften darstellen sozial ausgewogen gestaltet sein und zur sicherung des wirtschaftsstandortes sterreich beitragen wir erwarten uns vor allem auch eine st rkung der zivilgesellschaft und die steuerliche absetzbarkeit von spenden f r den natur umwelt und konsumentenschutz
5690190 in diesem zusammenhang unterst tzen wir auch die forderung fischlers ber die einbindung der zivilgesellschaft und insbesondere der umwelt ngos in die steuerreformdiskussion die sozialpartnerschaft endlich um die kologische komponente zu erweitern

5690199 wie kann es m glich sein dass ein solcher beschluss wie ihn die post nun bekanntgegeben hat mit stiller duldung des verantwortlichen ministers gefasst wurde die damit heraufbeschworenen folgen die besonders zu lasten der sterreichischen senioren gehen sind von einem sozial denkenden menschen nicht zu verantworten aber ein solcher zu sein darf man sich in der sp f hrungsriege offenbar nicht erlauben da diese im tiefk hl wettbewerb mit der sozialen permafrost partei vp steht

5690215 die sanierung der krankenkassen als teil einer umfassenden gesundheitsreform ist ein gebot der stunde weil die krankenkassen die basis daf r bilden dass jede sterreicherin und jeder sterreicher zugang zum besten gesundheitsversorgungssystem in europa hat

5690247 im just happy its my time finally i felt comfortable i just really wanted to win the heat
5690248 it was pretty good im always working to get in i feel pretty good i think everybody is a little sluggish
5690249 im glad i got the first race out of the way its a great feeling the crowd is great the tracks great i loved it its like any other meet just more people in the stands i felt really well i kept really relaxed i have another round tonight and i have to keep that in mind
5690250 it was good i scratched my first jump the runway is real fast i had to adjust and once i did i pulled out a big one
5690251 it went well i got through thats what matters i was happy to get a fair jump for my first jump because a lot of people are having problems with fouling on the second one we were just trying to be more aggressive coming into the board and to trust the run the runway is really fast i was forewarned by hyleas fountain and the male jumpers so i was able to adjust
5690252 i feel really good that i made i through i was so scared i had to get the jitters out it was a humongous crowd ive never seen a crowd this big my jump could have been better it was just a put it all down see what happens make it to the final jump
5690253 i was kind of surprised at the tears that came into my eyes after my third throw i cant be disappointed with being in the olympic qualifying round but that emotion shows me how competitive i am im really excited to do a lot better in the future i felt really good today really good on the runway it just didnt work out
5690254 the competition was good it was very exciting thrilling to be out there i still wish i could have done better
5690255 it was a great day for me i felt like i was soaring on wings like an eagle the lord carried me through he blessed me so much today
5690256 my run fitness wasnt quite there where i wanted it to be i think the maximum result wouldve been sixth i laid it all out there today i came off the bike in great position i started the run well it was a hot one but i did all i could thats all i had
5690257 i got on the bike in good position right where i needed to be i tried to attack the bike as best as i could but i didnt have good legs
5690258 i struggled relaxing on the run and i didnt have the legs to have a good day today
5690259 its something i had worked on and improved on this year so to have such a bad run was a bit of a surprise
5690260 its definitely disappointing i cant explain why i felt so bad out there today but you have to play the cards you are dealt
5690261 i struggled all day even in the swim i had a lot of trouble fighting the guys out there i had to swim pretty hard in the end to catch back up to the lead group
5690262 i pretty much hit my expectations i wanted to be in the mix and see what would happen
5690263 my goal for finishing was between seventh and 20th place so im very happy i was coming on strong at the end but i was a little too far back coming off the bike when youre down 30 seconds its hard to make it up
5690264 it makes me very happy to be the first for kenya
5690265 im still young and im looking forward to doing better maybe i can be the best again
5690266 but it would have been better if i could have finished on the podium but you know i did my best

5690283 he got a hold of my finger damn well he bit all the way down into my knuckle and broke the capsule my knuckle is in and chipped a piece of bone off it the bite also went through the nerves and other stuff in my finger at first it was extremely painful i think that a lot of it was due to the initial shock as well as seeing the skin and flesh dangling off and seeing blood literally spurting out as my heat beat and just forming a large pool on the floor
5690284 my arm was like an elephants trunk four times its original size from the fingers right up to the armpit it looked absolutely terrifying it was very very scary because the pain was intense and within just a short space of time i was drifting in and out of consciousness apparently it was touch and go for quite some time

5690286 speaking as someone who has experienced bad cuts from bass perch and even from the gill rakers of a flounder as i carefully returned it i think this speaks volumes about care and compassion when handling any fish and the importance of knowing plenty about the local wildlife and any fish that you keep or are considering keeping even the defence mechanisms of smaller fish are there to stop them getting eaten that is bodily swallowed so its no wonder they can deal with a couple of fingers wrapped around them
5690287 things have become normal the most salient issue is that of the stench the odd city smell that inundated everything i ate or drank and its disappearance i no longer notice its barely foul yet perpetually intriguing and especially foreign existence reminding me of the words of ricky roma in glengarry glen ross a film released in the year of my birth all train compartments smell vaguely of shit it gets so you dont mind it thats the worst thing that i can confess you know how long it took me to get there a long time when you die youre going to regret the things you dont do you think youre queer im going to tell you something were all queer you think youre a thief so what you get befuddled by a middle class morality get shut of it shut it out you cheat on your wife you did it live with it you fuck little girls so be it theres an absolute morality maybe and then what if you think there is go ahead be that thing bad people go to hell i dont think so if you think that act that way a hell exists on earth yes i wont live in it thats me this causes me to wonder what i will smell when i return to tempe what peculiar scents that have existed or changed and that i havent noticed because i was a part of them i think of the alleys behind the bars on hot nights and how different the trash may smell i wonder if the smell of rain will be even more invigorating the sun is different here too its not as yellow or precise in its radiation it is diffused by what must be pollution this i can discern on even impeccably clear days the horizon is broader this i can sense despite always being in the midst of imposing buildings and lunar towers my behavior is different isolated from my own language i am also isolated from its repercussions i can say whatever i want to whomever i want most of the time a fact which has led to my internal monologue becoming increasingly externalized i will be buying a yam while uttering the most vulgar things out loud and smiling at first feeling embarrassed and looking around to see if anyone heard me and then feeling empowered at the truth of no one understanding me i think about what i must sound like them what it must be like to hear loud nonsense and to look and see a giant strange foreigner talking to himself people look at me no matter what so i cant tell what theyre thinking

5690489 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5690490 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5690491 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5690492 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5690493 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

5690495 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground

5690500 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5690501 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5690502 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5690503 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5690504 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5690505 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5690506 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5690507 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5690508 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

5690536 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5690537 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce

5690570 peoples consensus is necessary for land acquisition the people must be made aware of the positive side of development before one asks for their land i trust the government is doing just that
5690571 i believe the opposition is not against development or industrialisation of the state
5690572 a broader consensus is necessary for land acquisition and industrialisation taking the opposition in confidence a right political environment is necessary but i know the industrialisation process in bengal is irreversible
5690573 we already have 13 000 acres and are in a position to claim another 12 000 acres
5690574 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5690575 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5690576 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5690577 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5690578 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5690579 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5690580 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5690581 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5690582 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5690583 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5690584 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5690585 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5690586 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5690587 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5690588 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5690589 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5690590 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5690591 detroit is falling its all foreign at the top and all american at the bottom
5690592 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5690593 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5690594 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5690595 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5690596 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5690597 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5690598 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5690599 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5690600 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5690601 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5690602 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5690603 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5690604 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5690605 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5690606 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5690607 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5690608 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5690609 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5690610 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5690611 the good people of illinois need to be recognized for their votes and i am doing just that in this public service presentation
5690612 we have a new generation of veterans returning home and we have a moral and ethical obligation to insure they receive complete quality and accessible healthcare and services
5690613 cette condamnation est distincte de laffaire pour laquelle il est poursuivi et est pendante devant la juridiction s n galaise

5690616 when i wake up in the morning i have crud in my eyes and i have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat
5690617 therefore you are ordered to operate the fire engines and firetrucks with a minimum of three firefighters
5690618 happier learn the secrets to daily joy and lasting fulfillment
5690619 a brain tumor the best thing that ever happened to me
5690620 i quit watching the news on tv in the morning i prefer reading the news on your website why start the day with negative information when you can start it with positive information it really has improved my attitude towards everyday life im in a good mood after reading the news on your website everyday people need to learn to focus on the postive rather than the negative theres so much good in this world
5690621 thank you for writing your newsletter some good news i enjoyed reading the positive stories i am heartened by thegoodness and generosity that i see in people keep up your good work
5690622 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site
5690623 when i get to work in the morning iget my coffee jump online and read the news every day i went home sadand depressed then i found your site and after reading the first storyi immediately felt my spirits lift i never went home sad again reading ordinary news gives us a sense that thats all there is butyour site reminds us that there is more and the world is not as bad asthe news would lead us to believe thank you for everything
5690624 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5690625 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5690626 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5690627 what they thought of me and how i handled myself in front of them was important
5690628 having been restructured out of the company was not the worst thing that could have happened living under that stress of not knowing what was going to happen was the most stressful thing
5690629 in my private practice within the last year or two the stress level of my patients has increased dramatically
5690630 a lot of time it will come down to family stress job issues economic issues people cant make ends meet a lot of marital dysfunction people overworked complaining about bosses i try and help people put these issues into perspective
5690631 with what we are going through now the real estate market people on the verge of foreclosure or losing jobs without knowing what is happening tomorrow it can cause a chronic insult to our body it may increase chances of depression and anxiety and lower our immune defenses and make us more susceptible to develop disease
5690632 it is known that chronic stress stimulates the laying down of extra fat in the abdominal area and has been associated with an increased risk of diabetes heart disease and hypertension
5690633 acute stress mobilizes with adrenaline and then hopefully the body adapts
5690634 but if its left in overdrive because of chronic stressors then the long term effects on biology sleep and appetite disturbance irritability episodic violence control issues can be associated with the wear and tear on our systems
5690635 one way we define stress is an individuals adaptive capacity to demands placed on that individual
5690636 people readily experience stress as painful while others may experience it as an opportunity
5690637 life brings these things and the way i acted was going to show them how to act when something in the future goes bad what they thought of me and how i handled myself in front of them was important
5690638 those runs allowed me to be by myself and to think and rethink and reposition those thoughts it was an opportunity to work out physically but also to put myself together again
5690639 that was a daunting experience i couldnt remember what ive done you have to go through a lifetime
5690640 that made me feel good ive done all of this i can start rebuilding i went through a lot of personal changes and growth the interview process helped me build confidence

5690654 i can do what i want only 1500 british hip hop fans are gonna hear it anyway
5690655 his is the voice of urban britain encompassing dub ragga funk and hip hop as it sweeps from crumbling street corners to ganja filled dancehalls setting gritty narratives against all manner of warped beats
5690656 his influence is incalculable and he opened the doors for the streets dizzee rascal et al
5690657 im less concerned with trying to be mr stand up reflecting on life this time i was pretty disturbed by the misinterpretation of the last record
5690658 i had my stint of being a dj selecta i had my stint of messing around with dv cams thinking im going to be the first director to make a movie straight from dv cam to dvd to the theatre and ive been trying to do the right thing trying to be a daddy
5690659 with this record i was trying to tune into that old channel one studio one aesthetic smoky rooms just the vibe of it lord knows what they were drinking smoking or eating or what they were doing or what was on their mind but to me that was a special period in music today with the technology thats available its pretty easy to make generic music music that sounds like everything else but to tap into a unique aesthetic to make a long player that is of its own world is a harder job how do we make it have an individual sound
5690660 what im always trying to tap into is that you wouldnt have reggae if you didnt have these people from the caribbean trying to reinterpret the soul and funk they heard on american radio im trying to do that all over again im trying to stretch the template
5690661 you gotta fart like theres no one there to smell it

5690665 the uks reigning mc roots is great because he stands on his own
5690666 its reassuring to remember that roots is still out there rejecting the club dwelling po facery of his peers
5690667 it is very painful to listen to some of the songs but it gives me joy that evas music is still giving so much pleasure to so many people
5690668 it was clear that fans of evas music wanted a new album but it was important to us that any new record was made up of songs that had not been heard before and that were of a high quality we are really pleased with the album it is long overdue
5690669 the biggest rule in pop is never ever compromise on the quality of the song writing
5690670 agnetha helped me start my career with a number one record she taught me everything about making records she really inspired me
5690671 i love bwo alexander bard is absolutely mad he has written one of the worlds best songs of the new millennium
5690672 pop culture can be very political think about the abortion debate in america where would that be without madonnas papa dont preach i really like it when she gets political it fascinates me that a three minute pop song can do so much to turn people around
5690673 a candlelit evening in a dusty attic with a victorian spectre and a drunken bee
5690674 glorious folk pop with an undeniable commercial underbelly sugar mouse is the sound of sunshine being let out of a jar on a rainy day wonderful stuff
5690675 great songs are universal and a great song can transcend time and speak to people all over the world a great song can be interpreted in so many different ways and still communicate emotionally thats what we set out to achieve with the new album timeless
5690676 i wasnt interested in covering the same songs that have already been covered a million times and i wasnt interested in just doing remakes
5690677 some of these are songs that ive loved since i was a kid
5690678 but others i discovered in the course of doing this project i wasnt familiar with jeff buckley before for example but i loved the song so much that i really got into his life and career and went back and discovered how amazing he was so that aspect of it was educational for me and i like the idea that i can pass that on to my audience
5690679 i like that verve is a label that cares about music

5690682 we sank one boat but the rest of the rebels were able to escape
5690683 they ambushed the rebels and sporadic fighting is still going on
5690684 troops are attacking our forces this is dangerous because the fighting could spread to other areas
5690685 we are still verifying the reports we cannot confirm it right now

5690700 three bills were submitted to placentia rcmp which were believed to be counterfeit they were examined again with bank employees and using the bank of canada website which has some guidelines about security features on there the bills were found to contain the correct security features at this point in time we have not seen any actual counterfeit money it was suspected at the time but it was just proven that the bills were legitimate
5690701 the bills were older bills and the security features were different than the new ones and it was just very hard to catch them the features that they were supposed to have they did have at this point in time from what we have seen there does not seem to be counterfeit but there could still be counterfeit out there
5690702 i am recommending that if someone suspects counterfeit money they not pass it on then they become part of the chain and you are just as guilty if you knowingly pass it on if you find one in your wallet unfortunately there is no recourse you have to take the hit
5690703 most definitely it would be a good idea for businesses to learn to identify the security features we are looking into getting some of that educational information getting it in print so we can circulate it around to our business community that would assist them in the future
5690704 she was a very caring and giving person she flew to new orleans during hurricane katrina comforting survivors she also took part in the 9 11 volunteering when all the planes were stranded in st johns airport she was in doing that she was always giving to others and she expected nothing back in return she was quite active in the community in the volunteer sector
5690705 she was involved very much in the community with a number of different groups and organizations she was involved in the star of the sea hall the star ladies auxiliary she helped out with the legion and a number of other things she was very active in the school both elementary and the high school she was involved with the red cross
5690706 she gave so much that people wanted to give back this walk was their way of saying thank you to her for what she had done in the community
5690707 i am just at a loss for words i am in awe i am totally totally in awe when i approached calvin back a month or so ago to get this going i thought if we raised a thousand dollars or so and got 25 walkers well hey we are going to do wonderful but right now the last count i did this morning was 12 500 and climbing we had about 200 225 walkers
5690708 it was more than i ever ever anticipated thank you is just not enough to say to the community for the support and what theyve done in karens memory and for this great cause of daffodil place
5690709 we wanted to contribute to something we felt the people in the community could benefit from as well so we felt that by contributing to it it is going to be a little part of ours and we can use it that was the purpose of choosing daffodil place
5690710 i am thinking this could very well be an annual event because when daffodil place gets up and running which is expected to be the spring of 2009 there is still going to be costs in operating and running the facility we are probably not anticipating the great result we got this year but nevertheless every cent counts
5690711 thank you is just not enough to say to the community for the support and what theyve done in karens memory and for this great cause of daffodil place
5690712 it appears that new mexico youth organized is operating as a political committee for purposes of the state campaign reporting act

5690715 there are many things we learned every day we participated in a new project certain days we focused on the global food crisis while other days were geared toward the child sponsorship program or different farming activities that they have down there every day we learned how they lived what they do to survive it was a cross cultural experience
5690716 we interacted with many people some who were better off than others we had a three day youth forum where the six youth ambassadors from canada had the opportunity to educate 17 tanzanian youth while at the same time they were educating us and that for me was a big learning experience making friends with these people was something that i valued very much
5690717 we gave them some insight on how we do this in canada but of course that is much different than the way they go about things so a big thing for us was to not impose our ideas just to keep an open mind and to take in what they were telling us
5690718 and of course they taught us about the troubles that they face and how they deal with aids and how they deal with poor education and lack of resources and lack of food so it was definitely challenging but also very worthwhile at the end when we were able to see our results see the difference we made
5690719 women down there are taught to be inferior to men and its a big thing that we as youth ambassadors tried to get across to them was that we are all equal and we really tried to push the girls to realize this by the end of the youth forum we could see that their confidence has grown so i think for all of us it was very emotional
5690720 i learned not to take things for granted and that there is so much that we can do to help for example we saw a family the father was a farmer living in singita tanzania and he was given an ox plow and some seeds by world vision and he had such a wonderful life his children had clean clothes nice clothes and they were clean and they were healthy and they had food in their bellies and it was just by this simple gift the farmers harvest actually because of this had been so good the past few years he was actually giving his extra money to his community so that was a wonderful story to see and learn about
5690721 it was very nice to see that the whole community together was aware of this problem and they were interacting they werent singling out these people it was nice to see how they all comforted one another
5690722 we were able to interact with the mother and father and also the children and for me that was a very touching experience being able to hold a little boy who was very sick he didnt move and he didnt squirm he didnt ask to get down and all the other children that i played with were like that but i guess because he was so sick he just didnt have it in him and for me that was very emotional when i was holding him so for me that was one of my most inspiring moments on the trip
5690723 i am so blessed that i had the opportunity to do that to go down and interact with the children and to see face to face the dangers and the troubles and the struggles that they are living with
5690724 there were moments that were overwhelming but as a team we took each day by day and we helped each other through the hard times we also were given strength by seeing how the tanzanians live and how they are determined and they just keep going and going no matter how hard it gets i think thats how we all got our strength to keep going we had to tough it up
5690725 so i was able to bring 30 soccer balls which i gave to some children that i saw in the streets but for the most part i gave them to a school down there there was about seven or eight hundred students there and the principal said he was most grateful and he said that it would enormously increase the attendance rate of the students at the school so he was very happy

5690730 german politicians are dismayed about the desecration of a monument to tens of thousands of homosexuals persecuted under the nazis that was opened less than three months ago in berlin
5690731 this cowardly and shocking act is an attack on the image we have of ourselves as a tolerant and open city

5690745 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5690746 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5690747 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5690748 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities

5690770 in a way it is business as usual in terms of the way we prepare for a new track we started from the information provided by the fia to put forward some speed profiles and this time we got some additional information because there was a race for f3 and gt cars before the grand prix that gave us the opportunity to collect some data we sent a couple of people to look at the logistics and to gain technical data with regard to driving lines so we are probably a little better prepared than for other new tracks
5690771 for a street circuit it looks quite impressive in terms of run off areas and the width of the track the circuit is very very wide and reasonably fast we expect it to be in the mid range of downforce and quite severe on brakes at the beginning we expect that the grip will be quite low but that should improve throughout the weekend the downforce level will be very different compared to hungary because the average speed is relatively high and so everyone will try to drop downforce while being mindful that the grip level appears to be very low
5690772 these are the kind of details that will have been sorted out before the grand prix weekend we were especially concerned by the swing bridge because normally it moves to allow boats into the harbour there is a 3cm gap in width and a couple of millimeters gap in height it seems it has caused a few issues in f3 so we will monitor the situation very closely
5690773 thats extremely important the tyre choice is already done but it will be the decisive factor in whether we use primarily the soft or the super soft tyre from bridgestones range and it will also influence downforce levels
5690774 i think we can expect quite a lot of running but probably not at the beginning of the session when the track will be very dusty but for sure we need to collect a lot of data and i think we will see significantly more running than on a well known track
5690775 its always an added challenge to have no reference and you have to think more about what is comparable its just more interesting to try to find the dominant performance factors before our rivals it will be a very busy weekend and we expect that logistically things might be a little tense just because its a new situation but i expect everything will be okay in the end
5690776 we were very pleased with our performance in hungary it goes without saying our pace was really good especially with timo who as well as finishing second was fighting for the top three in qualifying in fact his first lap time in q3 was the second best of the session when you take into account the fuel loads just behind hamilton fifth was his best qualifying result and maybe the teams best this season in terms of overall pace timos race was also excellent and he was very close to kovalainens mclaren in performance terms so he finished on the podium on merit
5690777 he is getting better and better in both qualifying and the race and looks very promising he has been strong several times already this season and showed a particularly good race pace in hockenheim so budapest was not a one off timo is obviously finishing his learning phase jarno was perhaps a couple of tenths down in comparison at hungary but he was not quite as happy with the set up he had a heavier fuel load in qualifying and he was also on the second race for the engine whereas timo had a fresh one so both cars were very competitive in budapest which is very good for the team
5690778 absolutely 100 per cent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5690779 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5690780 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5690781 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5690782 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5690783 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5690784 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5690785 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5690786 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5690787 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5690788 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5690789 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5690790 because fraternities and sororities can have such positive influences on todays college students alfred state college has taken steps to support and nurture these organizations with the proviso that the college and the fraternities sororities have the same goals to this end the student run greek council on campus and appropriate student life administrators have forged a relationship statement that spells out the criteria greek groups need to follow in order to receive the recognition and support of the college
5690791 students need to take ownership of their club and of the actions of its members
5690792 when students are held accountable most often they live up to our expectations
5690793 should a greek lettered organization or any student organization on campus for that matter disregard the guidelines set in place it risks losing recognition by the college groups who choose not to abide by our standards cannot seek to associate with the college or with greek senate nor will they obtain or retain college recognition
5690794 weve had great success with our greek organizations in the past few years
5690795 and were expecting even greater success with the full implementation of our relationship statement
5690796 the ohio republican party yesterday threatened legal action if ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner allows ohioans to simultaneously register to vote and cast absentee ballots
5690797 lower down on the list bust still moderately important is good looks
5690798 this same pattern has been demonstrated in literally hundreds of studies around the world
5690799 a man who has status usually also has ambition intelligence and good social skills
5690800 to become financially and socially successful you need these other attributes
5690801 when it does happen its usually a clear case of trading you see the younger partner offering youth and physical appeal and the older partner financial stability which may be one way up the social ladder for the younger partner
5690802 ive always been inspired by those events or people who compel us to look at the bigger picture and question our ethics my heroes at home were martin bell kate adie and sir ranulph fiennes

5690964 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5690965 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5690966 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
5690967 i cant fault lotames intent on innovation for the first time advertisers can capture real data in real time for a specific demographic that they really want to target and although lotame would be best served working with larger organizations it thinks it has found its niche and as it continues to grow will continue to create a value proposition for advertisers that want to capitalize on the social networking space

5690969 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5690970 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5690971 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5690972 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
5690973 moms conventional wisdom of eating fruits and vegetables to lead a healthy life has evolved into more scientific fact finding research during the last four decades due to advances in science

5690981 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
5690982 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
5690983 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5690984 catalysis is particularly important when it comes to energy supply
5690985 mike was very aware of and concerned about the big energy problem and the role of catalysis in the solution
5690986 this symposium is our way of honoring mike and the impact he had on our personal and professional lives
5690987 we are working to find cheaper ways to make these processes happen
5690988 in order to maximize catalyst performance we have to understand how the process works
5690989 for example there are a very large number of applications involving catalysis that utilize alumina as the catalyst support material

5690992 the base line increase we are seeking is 10 over two years in order to inflation proof our members basic pay against expected cost of living increases of around 5 a year over that period
5690993 in addition we aim to progress other sector specific issues which may have a significant impact on our members earnings including recognition of professional qualifications rewards for enhanced productivity guarantees on job security and measures to enhance work life balance
5690994 for example the minimum competency requirement initiated by the financial regulator has given rise to a situation where bank staff are now required to undergo further training to achieve a new qualification
5690995 there are issues around the funding of that training and the appropriate level of reward in recognition of achieving the higher qualification while we have secured a positive outcome to negotiations with one of the banks national irish this matter is still to be addressed by the other three
5690996 common to all four banks are issues around the management of change including the appropriate rewards for productivity improvements and compensation in the event of loss of profit share especially in cases where profit share has formed an integral element in the overall reward package
5690997 we are also determined to pursue significant improvements in the work life balance agenda
5690998 for example the current provisions for paid maternity leave in the four major banks are some way behind best practice for the private sector

5691060 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5691061 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5691062 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5691063 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5691085 international personalities bodies or organisations that have distinctively contributed to rendering an outstanding human service and has achieved great actions in defending human rights protecting the causes of freedom and supporting peace everywhere in the world
5691086 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5691087 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5691088 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5691089 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5691090 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5691091 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5691092 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5691093 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5691094 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5691095 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5691096 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5691097 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5691098 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5691099 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5691100 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5691101 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5691102 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5691103 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5691104 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5691105 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5691106 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5691107 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5691108 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5691109 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5691110 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5691111 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5691112 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5691113 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5691114 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5691115 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5691116 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5691117 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5691118 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5691119 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5691120 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5691121 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5691122 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5691123 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5691124 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5691125 the widespread use of genetically modified crops would be the biggest environmental disaster of all time
5691126 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5691127 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

5691130 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking

5691132 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5691133 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5691134 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5691135 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5691136 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5691137 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5691138 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5691139 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5691140 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5691141 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5691142 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5691143 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5691144 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5691145 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5691146 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5691147 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5691148 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5691149 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5691150 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5691151 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5691152 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5691153 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5691154 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5691155 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5691156 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5691157 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5691158 who are open to doing something on the production side
5691159 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5691160 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5691161 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5691162 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5691163 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5691164 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5691165 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5691166 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5691167 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5691168 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5691169 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5691170 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5691171 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5691209 simplistic remedies likely to make things worse in the longer term currency guru george soros is probably right a global economy needs a global central bank and a global framework of fiscal discipline in a word world government the national governments still have too much power to deviate from central monetary and fiscal guidelines
5691210 constitutions are both the licence to govern and the limit on excessive government
5691211 the triads of molmutius who ruled britain about 450 bc probably provide the first simple constitution in british history
5691212 habeas corpus the essence of english common law states quite clearly that no man may be held guilty until his crime has been proved

5691603 what has happened is that the commission now wants accreditation and voting to take place simultaneously with those who have voted being free to leave the voting area that destroys transparency and leaves room for unscrupulous politicians to stuff the ballot boxes and falsify results in the absence of voters
5691604 this same method was used in previous elections and in 2003 and 2007 it was flagrantly exploited for double voting ghost voting migratory voting and falsification of electoral results
5691605 right now lagos state government and ac leadership ought to show good example by not only talking the talk but walking the talk or why did they spend so much in the last two months to host the nation and the pro democracy family in celebrating bashorun moshood abiola and june 12 if not for the free and fair elections that evolved from the open ballot system we are now pushing
5691606 the respect president yaradua accorded the supreme court judgment which said the federal government can not withold funds for lagos state local government councils should be reciprocated by the lagos state government by not going ahead to hold elections into those 37 entities it created
5691607 going by the new ac guidelines on the forthcoming council polls without any manipulation whatsoever then the primaries should be a transparent one
5691608 we have decided to start with the stakeholders forum so that we will be able to galvanise the opinion and views of all the players in the polity so that it wont appear as if we are just imposing conditions and terms on candidates
5691609 all the registered political parties will have representatives at the polling unit they are going to have representatives so that at the end of the day when we have carried out all due diligence whatever comes out of it ours is not going to be business as usual as it happens in all other states we are going to make sure that there is transparency and cleanliness in all our actions when we have done that then we would not bother ourselves about the outcome of the results
5691610 they should come and make the electoral process credible even if an electoral body wants to rig but if the participants are very active in the process it may be very difficult because for you to rig election it involves personnel it involves a process
5691611 as a matter of fact it has always been under the whims and caprices of the state thus providing opportunity for whoever is in control of the state machinery to manipulate the elections to the benefit of the ruling party in the state
5691612 this has continued to discourage voters in participating in elections at this level as every individual believes that what goes on in the local government council elections is more of selection than election
5691613 the current trend in the national polity in which results of elections were being reversed by tribunals does not portray the nigerian political environment in good light particularly with the status of our country among the comity of nation
5691614 follow due process in choosing your candidates and allow the will of party members to prevail
5691615 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need

5691618 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team

5691621 the forum will be an opportunity for oklahomas concerned parties to express their views about the federal law that prohibits vehicles weighing over 10 000 pounds from crossing state lines while carrying their crops livestock or other goods this is a critical issue to oklahomans involved in all areas of agriculture and related businesses it is not only a transportation issue but an economic issue

5691623 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

5691628 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5691629 its a totally bogus issue its challenging the integrity of the secret service challenging the integrity of my security staff and challenging the integrity of john mccain of which both barack obama and john agreed to the terms right up front theres no way he could have heard the questions the fact is that john mccain did get there a little late and the truth is i actually got to tell barack obama about one of the questions in advance that i didnt get to tell john mccain about because he wasnt there
5691630 well in the first place i dont know that you can attribute to the obama campaign it was just a joke it was just silly to say the cone of silence the secret service was with him the entire time and then they put him immediately in the other building so i wasnt even sure that he hadnt arrived by the time we were moving on stage
5691631 there was a rumor going around that he watched the program on a monitor in the green room that we had him in well theres only one problem with it my staff disconnected that thing two days before it happened so if they had happened to turn it on it would have been all just static
5691632 i think its only an issue because rick warren said that he had been in this room sequestered off as it turned out he wasnt im sure that pastor warren didnt know that because i get the sense that he would have never have made that representation if he knew it but i dont think its a big deal the campaign doesnt think its a big deal
5691633 these charges are being made or suggestions are being made by the obama campaign because they know their man lost the evening it is striking that they cant just accept that and go on that they have to pretend that somehow mccain must have cheated to have won i think the obama campaign has set itself up for looking like whiners and i hope senator mccain challenges obama to have another forum tomorrow
5691634 this is going to sound like special pleading on my part but i mean andrea mitchell is a paragon of objective down the line reporting you know we all honor tim russert shes the princess of that royal family and rather than attack andrea they should have ruled out the amen corner to praise mccains performance because obama was tentative i saw obama at that event he wasnt really good he didnt give great answers he was too busy defending his flank within the democratic party he didnt really bond with those people and mccain by all accounts did and thats what they should have stressed rather than used this as an opportunity to pick a fight with andrea which doesnt necessarily hold water its hard to prove one way or the other
5691635 senator obamas campaign is the one thats raising this as a concern i really would suggest that they not challenge the credibility of pastor rick warren hes one of the most universally respected and admired individuals in the country and i dont think his credibility can be questioned
5691636 i think this explains why obama is not eager to do town hall meetings with mccain or to take any other direct debate other than the ones that are already scheduled the official debates the attack by the mccain campaign on nbc i think had something to do with something else maybe some problems they have been having or an eagerness to call attention to this particular forum that mccain clearly won
5691637 i actually think this episode is fairly illuminating because its about one thing and one thing only and that is the arrogance of the obama campaign it is so far beyond their ability to comprehend that mccain cleaned their clock the other night which he did instead of acknowledging that perhaps obama has a shortcoming and didnt do as well as they thought he should have theyre trying to say that mccain cheated
5691638 its not that much of a surprise its been crunch time for senator obama he has exactly one week you know to make this vice presidential announcement known and hes going to do it as soon as wednesday it could be anywhere from wednesday and really through the end of the weekend the campaign right now were told is still trying to figure out exactly at what point along to do it theyre watching hurricane fay he is close to making his decision his advisors wont say he has made it for sure because something could always change between now and then but hes not begin to notify the people who did not get it yet were not even sure if michelle obama knows for sure
5691639 they want to roll into this convention they want a big buildup so they can dominate the news cycle from the time they announce this vice presidential candidate all the way through next week mostly in a positive light you get that first vp pick and for the first couple of days it is positive kind of press that you tend to get so they are timing this just to maximize all that time because they know after a week from thursday that it then moves over to the republicans so they are trying to get a good seven eight nine 10 days out of this
5691640 now this is just hours after barack obama accepts the democratic nomination at invesco field in denver colorado
5691641 the idea of doing it on his birthday and doing it in ohio is smart a ohio is this hugely important swing state and the polls suggest that john mccain who was a little behind there with his recent surge has now moved slightly ahead and doing it on his birthday takes the story away from the 72 year old birthday to the new vigor thats brought by a vice presidential candidate so i think thats a pretty smart move i think the one thing that is sort of etiquette in politics is you dont do your vice presidential candidate in a way that competes with the other guys convention you dont do it in a way that sort of rains on his parade
5691642 the fact that hes doing it on his 72nd birthday may suggest that he is going to pick someone younger

5691658 weve designed our solar modules specifically for the electrical utilities scale market
5691659 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near portland oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5691660 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later
5691661 the electrical market is enormous to keep up with demand the utilities are reaching out for new power production methods that are clean and safe long term these power fields are great investments that can provide a 5 year payback on the average installation and then you have 15 years of cash flow with low operating costs we see this trend picking up significantly and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity

5691693 despite various legislative proposals in congress to change ethanol policies senate agriculture committee chairman tom harkin d iowa said monday he doesnt see any plan getting approved this fall that would jeopardize the domestic ethanol industry
5691694 lawmakers looking to lower prices of corn or gasoline have tossed out proposals to reduce the renewable fuels standard or lower the 54 cent tariff on imported ethanol
5691695 with the abatement of high corn prices that have come down now oil prices are down things have eased a little bit so i dont think you will see much debate this fall harkin d iowa said following a committee field hearing on food and fuel in omaha
5691696 still harkin said the first major issues the next president will tackle will be winding down the war in iraq health care policy and energy policy
5691697 it will be in full force next year harkin said
5691698 at that point you will see the lid blown off dale said
5691699 dale and others involved in the scientific side of cellulosic production spoke in almost unlimited terms on the potential of renewable fuel that could be produced
5691700 the one limitation we see is a logistics limitation foust said
5691701 bill lapp of the omaha based advanced economic solutions was included as a witness to provide the perspective of food manufacturers and restaurants lapp said spikes in commodities prices since 1981 largely have been weather related and therefore short lived
5691702 in contrast recent increases have been more sustained and are expected to continue he testified
5691703 lapp predicted that food price inflation will increase by an average of 9 percent annually between 2008 and 2012 as the higher prices of corn and other commodities are passed on to consumers
5691704 a u s senate committee hearing organized to address the ongoing food versus fuel debate over ethanol offered confidence to its organizers but left livestock producers troubled that their concerns werent fully recognized
5691705 many defended ethanol tying corn prices to other factors including growth in demand worldwide for livestock feed others looked ahead referencing increased production that will help level off high corn prices
5691706 among those making such promises was dean oestreich chairman of dupont co s pioneer hi bred and vice president of the johnston iowa based dupont agriculture and nutrition he expects a 40 percent increase in corn and soybean yields in the next 10 years which would push corn production to 225 bushels per acre
5691707 bruce babcock in the first panel and an agricultural economist at iowa state university was unable to answer a harkin question about what percentage of higher food costs might be coming from ethanol
5691708 no one knows that he said when sought out during a morning break
5691709 there is evidence to support a conclusion that a 30 percent rise in the corn price will have only a 1 percent effect on food prices he added
5691710 the bigger impact on food prices might be at the meat counter as beef pork and poultry producers try to cut their losses by cutting down further on numbers of animals and birds
5691711 that will start in 09 babcock said the last part of this year into 09
5691712 despite what could be nebraskas second largest corn crop ever state crop and livestock producers were on opposite ends on the effectiveness of the federal ethanol mandate
5691713 testifying at a senate agricultural committee hearing on monday in omaha michael kelsey nebraska cattlemen executive vice president said his organization strongly supports nebraskas ethanol industry
5691714 however many believe that the only way to develop renewable fuels is to mandate their production and use kelsey said
5691715 kelsey was critical of the renewable fuels standard which next year will require approximately 3 5 billion bushels of corn
5691716 mandating production and usage has never been good over the long term for any industry kelsey said
5691717 livestock producers have been hit by sharply higher feed costs fueled by competing use demands for corn and soybeans and by rising energy prices some analysts argue that current public policies including financial incentives that divert corn from feed uses into ethanol production have exacerbated if not caused these higher costs other factors which some believe to be at least as significant include crop production declines due to weather and higher global demand for commodities proposed options aimed at easing the impacts of higher feed costs include changes in ethanol incentives use of conservation land for forage use and direct aid to producers
5691718 94 of soybeans are blooming compared to 88 a week ago and 97 both a year ago and on the five year average recent good weather has let most states complete this stage or catch up but a number of the major states remain behind average
5691719 nearby chicago board of trade september soybeans rose 67 50 cents to 12 79 a bushel after temporarily climbing the daily exchange imposed limit of 70 cents september corn closed up 23 25 cents at 5 53 while september wheat surged 35 50 cents to 8 5975
5691720 soybeans and corn jumped on forecasts for below normal rainfall in key growing areas during the next six to 10 days traders said
5691721 the lack of moisture could be threatening to crops in northeastern iowa central south dakota and eastern nebraska said paul markert staff meteorologist for mda earthsat weather a private weather firm
5691722 most grain prices have fallen between 20 and 35 since the end of june as investors have piled out of commodities across the board but figures published last week from the u s agriculture department showed that despite the size of the crop global demand for grains is rising rapidly enough to sustain high prices
5691723 francisco blanch head of commodity research at merrill lynch said the question now is whether the recent fall in grain prices is because of volatility in the markets or economic weakness driving away investors if its volatility investors will come back he said
5691724 argentine farmers resumed protests on monday for the first time since the government was forced to repeal a tax hike on soy exports last month demanding further changes to farm policy
5691725 between march and july farmers fought the tax hike by staging several commercial strikes and blocking rural highways which disrupted the grains trade in one of the worlds top exporters and caused some food and fuel shortages locally
5691726 center left president cristina fernandez repealed the tax hike after the senate narrowly voted it down in mid july she replaced her cabinet chief and the countrys agriculture secretary in the wake of the embarrassing defeat
5691727 but eduardo buzzi head of the argentine agrarian federation faa said the dispute is not over since heavy state intervention has slashed profits for the small and medium scale farmers his group represents
5691728 summer nutrition programs are falling far short of the need says the frac report
5691729 that number is slightly higher than in summer 2006 by about 2 000 children though it represents a decline in the programs reach since 2002 when 3 2 million children received summer lunches
5691730 summer schools camps parks and youth enrichment programs are some of the most common summer meal providers the government reimburses them about 1 73 for each breakfast and 3 04 for each lunch or dinner served with slightly higher rates in alaska and hawaii according to the usda web site
5691731 in a last minute maneuver that is only now coming to light farm bill authors cut out dried fruits and nuts from an ambitious school snack program the action could slam the door on some potentially lucrative markets
5691732 this is a real problem with the bill excluding an entire industry said dan haley a lobbyist for california specialty crops
5691733 starting oct 1 selected schools in all 50 states will be able to partake in the fresh fruit and vegetable snack program the new farm bill adds some 500 million for the purchases over the next five years
5691734 there was a general assumption that nuts and dried fruits would be included in this program they are considered to be healthy noted rep jim costa d fresno
5691735 but after congress finished the farm bill apparently california lawmakers realized the bill and an accompanying 423 page report had been adjusted in part this so called report language limited the reach of the fresh snack program
5691736 it is not the intent of the bills managers to allow this program to provide other products such as nuts either on their own or co mingled with other foods such as in a trail mix the bill report states
5691737 haley whose clients include the nut growing cooperative diamond of california said the provision was included when no one was looking senate staffers are thought to have been primarily responsible california farm bureau federation national affairs director jack king indicated monday
5691738 world bank group president robert b zoellick issued the following statement today on the doha wto negotiations
5691739 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognizing that there was a good package of results left on the table it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5691740 president lula of brazil has called on the parties not to let the wto negotiations fail because of differences over a special safeguard for agriculture he is right

5691747 community notification reflects the perception that registration alone is inadequate to protect the public against released sex offenders and that notification provides the public with a better means of protecting itself notification proponents believe that by informing the public about the presence of a sex offender in the community neighbors will be able to take action to protect themselves from sex offenders by keeping themselves and their children out of harms way
5691748 in one sense the most significant finding of the notification meetings survey may be the inverse relationship between the factors that make notification meetings successful i e providing ample amounts of helpful information and the high anxiety levels among those in attendance many attendees emerged from such meetings better informed but still feeling anxious and frustrated however such feelings now were focused on the sex offender
5691749 the community notification process adversely affected their transition from prison to the outside world loss of employment exclusion from residence were frequently cited consequences of expanded notification actions they traced their difficulty in finding a place to live and in keeping a job to community notification and media sensationalism
5691750 survey results indicate a need to educate the public about the realities of what community notification laws can and cannot be expected to accomplish the public has the right to be adequately informed of the risks posed by sex offenders but also must understand that the notification law does not offer recourse for residents who seek to remove a sex offender from their neighborhood
5691751 use s a three tier notification system based on risk assessment level 1 cases limit notification to law enforcement agencies in a specific area level 2 uses targeted notification to schools daycare providers and so forth and level 3 entails expanded notification through community meetings news media releases and so forth
5691752 the jurisdictions sex offender website includes a function under which members of the public and organizations can request notification when sex offenders commence residence employment or school attendance within zip code or geographic radius areas specified by the requester where the requester provides an e mail address to which the notice is to be sent upon posting on the jurisdictions sex offender website of new residence employment or school attendance information for a sex offender within an area specified by the requester the system automatically sends an e mail notice to the requester that identifies the sex offender thus enabling the requester to access the jurisdictions website and view the new information about the sex offender

5691765 tho i may share your views on our current government this particular instance is quite innocent and is merely a shout out to filipinos

5691788 la primera consideraci n que tenemos que hacer es que el gobierno se corre de un escenario que hab a planteado en la campa a que es salir de los conflictos discutiendo con las partes interesadas pero hoy estamos recibiendo una propuesta unilateral por parte del gobierno desear amos tener una mesa de discusi n

5691796 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5691797 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5691798 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5691799 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5691800 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system

5691814 we normally dont travel outside of the wilmington area for location shots because it adds to production time
5691815 but jacksonville was the store that books a million thought we should use for this particular episode and it turned out to be a good decision
5691816 its everything from hair and makeup lighting grip sound actors stand ins everything we need to make a tv show
5691817 im a firm believer that theres never an easy shoot or an easy scene
5691818 it takes a lot of people to accomplish what we do every episode
5691819 for the high quality demand of network tv it takes a tremendous amount of people to get it right
5691820 when we show up it looks like the circus came to town
5691821 i like the realism it reminds of things that have happened to me
5691822 i came here to get a bible and i saw the sign about the show on the door and i was like what

5691824 im hooked its great i can relate to it a lot
5691825 i just spent my afternoon getting ready with my make up artist and hair stylist and am headed to the big season premiere party i shot a couple videos for you that i will be uploading later but here are some photos so you guys can see my final look what do you think my stylist and i chose a julia clancey dress and then i chose mary norton shoes to wear with it

5691832 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5691833 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5691834 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5691835 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5691836 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5691837 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5691838 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5691839 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5691840 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5691841 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5691842 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5691843 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5691844 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5691845 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5691846 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5691847 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5691848 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5691849 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5691850 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5691851 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5691852 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5691853 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5691854 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5691855 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops

5691861 the credit crunch of the past year has reduced liquidity available to precious metals traders and speculators
5691862 the result being increased volatility both on the way up and as we have seen in recent weeks on the way down
5691863 it has been punished amid a broad based correction in commodities but it is likely a short term blip as it underscores the frailty of fiat currency globally
5691864 we see gold as attractive heading into a period of seasonally strong physical out take which tends to tighten the market and allow any negative macro catalysts to be rapidly transmitted to prices
5691865 gold will likely shine over time long term drivers remain intact falling mine production especially in south africa competitive currency devaluations wealth creation on india china and petro dollar flows
5691866 the moment when money loses its purchasing power because real interest rates after inflation are negative assets such as raw land commodities art and collectibles become a store of value
5691867 less restrictive monetary conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase

5691926 factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion
5691927 take account of several different considerations of which conflict of interest is one
5691928 the mere fact that benefit claims are decided by a paid human resources administrator who works for the defendant corporation does not without more suffice to create an inherent conflict of interest were that enough there would be a near presumption of a conflict of interest in every case in which an employer both offers a plan and pays someone to administer it making a full application of the abuse of discretion standard the exception not the rule
5691929 the fact that a plan administrator both evaluates claims for benefits and pays benefits claims creates the kind of conflict of interest
5691930 i f a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest
5691931 factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion
5691932 take account of several different considerations of which conflict of interest is one
5691933 w hether the administrators interpretation is consistent with a fair reading of the plan
5691934 where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that the conflict of interest affected the benefits decision

5691942 dit was een teleurstellende prestatie nigeria heeft verdiend gewonnen en wij hebben te weinig laten zien in de eerste helft was het ook te warm voor ons
5691943 zij bereikten wel goed hun spits terwijl ik constant tussen drie man liep en niet wist waar eerst druk te zetten
5691944 ja in de eerste helft kregen we nog twee goede kansen en haroun trapte zelfs nog op de lat maar het mocht jammer genoeg niet zijn
5691945 natuurlijk kunnen we ons daar nog voor opladen we spelen tenslotte voor een medaille
5691946 in tegenstelling tot de openingsrace waarin ieder team sowieso naar de volgende ronde ging is er nu wel druk op de ketel en dat hebben we net nodig om ons optimaal te kunnen focussen het was drie maand geleden dat we een race vaarden zodat we maandag duidelijk scherpte en ritme misten die extra wedstrijd zal ons goed doen al moeten we er uiteraard voor zorgen dat we binnen de eerste drie eindigen anders zit het tornooi er voor ons al op en daaraan wil ik niet denken
5691947 als we vierde kunnen finishen in een loodzware voorwedstrijd en daarin op slechts drie seconden strandden van de regerende wereldkampioenen colin carr lijkt het me normaal dat we voor deze halve finalerace voluit in onze kansen geloven we hadden gisteren al een goed gevoel en moeten dat nu met een finaleplaats kunnen concretiseren tenslotte hadden we ook de tweede snelste tijd op de zeven boten die morgen om de laatste drie finaletickets zullen knokken

5691955 i think people in this community dont have a good opinion about this school and i dont know why this year were going to toot our horns and let people know who we are

5691959 taking three of four in detroit is not an easy thing to do
5691960 i think theres a lot of confidence right now within our club everybody knows that sundays win in boston was great but new yorks ahead of us in the standings and thats an even bigger series when you start looking ahead where teams are we have to start thinking about getting the deficit to three or four games behind then you can start thinking about being in this thing weve got to chip away
5691961 i think theres a reason im here that the chance to come back here came my way at this time
5691962 i really believe this team is capable of doing something special maybe not this year but then again maybe this year
5691963 however it plays out i have a good feeling about this ball club
5691964 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
5691965 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority
5691966 the judge indicated that there was an overwhelming likelihood green will face an immediate and significant sentence of imprisonment when he is sentenced next month this can only be right and proper given the dreadful abuse he subjected a succession of young boys to
5691967 i would however urge them to either contact the police or speak to me in confidence in order to bring closure to their ordeal
5691968 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation
5691969 it is regrettable when something like this happens our priority and concern is always for the victims
5691970 it is true that the last satellite they launched before this one was a failure but you can take that one of two ways if you look at the history of the satellite launch business usually the return to flight the next one after a failure has a very high success rate because they double check and triple check everything
5691971 we even had other satellite operators calling us and wanting to buy our slot
5691972 but as they say in the business 80 to 90 of the launch risk is now behind us
5691973 we held off popping the corks from the champagne bottles until this morning
5691974 were very keen to reassure the community and to encourage them to work with us and the police theres a huge level of shock and concern

5692002 hey have you heard about this group called prayer at the pump theyre a prayer group that sprang up and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices otherwise known as the bush energy plan
5692003 this isnt political at all there are people here for mccain for obama there are people who are libertarian

5692016 its not going to happen to me i know what i am doing
5692017 prosperity peace and calm in the crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighbouring russia coincide
5692018 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5692019 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5692020 i cant think of anyone i know whos less like morgan freeman than you
5692021 ive been reading his stuff for a while and the truth of the matter is that

5692025 yes i believe in smaller government and less government dependency i believe in a mans right to succeed and a mans right to fail based on his ability preparation determination or lack thereof but that isnt what makes me a republican it makes me one who believes in self sufficiency it makes me a man who views my ability through the prism labeled limitless opportunity what makes me a republican is that said party most closely identifies with the values i adhere to or at least the party has for the most part as a child i was not raised with the understanding that it was the governments job to provide for me i was raised with the dictate that education and faith were the two essentials necessary to succeed i was inculcated with an understanding that the only way i would be able to face myself in the mirror was if i worked hard and looked only to myself and to my god there was no financial parachute from the family and certainly none from the government it is precisely the opposite of what i was raised to believe that drives so many persons of color specifically to buy into the barack obama mania they believe that his being black will somehow be of extraordinary benefit to them
5692026 sadly many people have no clue what the democrat party or the republican party stand for they understand only take and give me they do not understand liberal conservative or libertarian they only understand its the governments job to keep them happy conservatism liberalism and libertarianism are not based on the color of a candidates or voters skin they are based upon the fundamental core beliefs of individuals it is based upon their understanding of the world around them if a person is programmed from birth that he is entitled to special provisions based on race and or gender that person will despise any person or group that dares to tell him therell be no handouts and few free rides the messages of work hard to get ahead and that there are no guarantees in life is anathema to them working hard to test well and thus be accepted into a good school based on merit is replaced with work hard maybe and take advantage of an entitlement education commonly referred to as diversity programs if the government is looked upon as being there to supply every need then that is all individuals programmed to think accordingly will want to hear not unlike my friend the problem with that mindset is that it stems from a flawed understanding of government and personal responsibility that sentences the individual to the plantation of life long mediocrity
5692027 there is nothing wrong with ethnic pride but voting is about more than that it is about character and that includes the character of the voters as much or more than it does the character of the candidates

5692035 i have not decided on a candidate i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
5692036 do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa
5692037 your evil spawn and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity
5692038 up until that point i dont think they thought anyone had noticed them
5692039 this is nothing shes an old friend of mine leave us alone
5692040 in an ideal world we would get it to the point where there would be no barriers
5692041 there have been complaints from time to time but those have been modest
5692042 the increases in volume of air traffic and the consequent increases in congestion on the ground are from the analysis that weve done pretty unavoidable
5692043 i think the government is making a mistake and i will carry on telling them that i think they are making a mistake

5692050 after almost two years these sites have still not been decontaminated and continue to threaten the lives and health of tens of thousands of residents across different social spectrums in abidjan
5692051 the government has informed me that it does not have the technical capacity to clean up and decontaminate the dumpsites in a timelier manner
5692052 this is to send a signal to other trans national corporations and individuals that such crimes will not go unpunished and that africa is not a cheap dumping ground
5692053 if turkey wins a non permanent seat on the un security council this will do much to promote peace security and stability all over the world
5692054 an argument might well be made that realistically there was nothing the west could have done then or now that would have forced the russians out but there was bitterness then as now that the west may have encouraged people to risk their lives relying on us when we knew from the outset that we were not about to risk armed conflict with a nuclear superpower over hungary then or georgia now the west has a long history of doing nothing utilizing the united nations and before that the league of nations to create the illusion that they are doing something when they make speeches and pass resolutions neither speeches nor resolutions are going to make any difference to the russians to the iranians or to any other belligerent nation we know it they know it and the world knows it
5692055 apparently barack obama doesnt yet know it judging by his initial response to news of the russian invasion of georgia which was to call on both sides to cease fire and then go to the u n later he changed his position to correspond to john mccains more grown up position that russians have to pay a price if we expect them to change their behavior the real question is whether we can force the russians to pay a serious price without ourselves paying a more serious price than we are prepared to pay the russians have already pointed out that the united states needs their cooperation on international problems these problems include the war on terrorism and perhaps the biggest problem of them all irans movement toward building nuclear weapons that can be used either directly by iran or more likely by turning some of these nuclear bombs over to terrorists whom iran has been supplying with other weapons there are two problems 1 what are we going to do and 2 what are we going to say
5692056 some people seem to think that if we had already included georgia in nato russia would not have attacked but what if they attacked anyway would we have done any more than we are doing now would that have protected georgia or would our inaction have just brought the reliability of our protection of other nato countries into question if anything we ought to be thinking about pulling out of nato ourselves european countries already have the wealth to produce their own military defense if they do not have the will that is their problem what american officials can do is keep their mouths shut if they dont intend to back up their words
5692057 ich glaube dass er wirtschaftlich den durchblick hat das braucht john mccain das ist sein einziger schwachpunkt
5692058 president shimon peres has categorically denied reports in the pakistani media that he was using his influence to try to help beleaguered pakistani president pervez musharraf to leave pakistan safely and avoid impeachment

5692091 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing its own and living off its own means
5692092 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5692093 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5692094 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5692095 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5692096 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists

5692130 kids should be able to hold and pet the chicks and know where chicks and eggs come from but the fair association has this policy to address a safety issue

5692133 its the city folks who are unfamiliar with being around animals
5692134 the most at risk are children under 5 and the highest risk is salmonella from handling baby chicks this is an issue nationally
5692135 ive seen where a child has cotton candy and goes to see the goats the goat licks the sugar from the hand the child uses to pet it and then the child walks away using that same hand to put cotton candy in his mouth
5692136 based on our analysis it is likely that increased co payments intended to control costs will exacerbate the disparities seen across socioeconomic groups
5692137 we must encourage employers and health plans to develop benefit strategies that improve the health of all patients especially those with chronic diseases which can lead to lower total healthcare costs

5692155 we are grateful to the many individuals businesses foundations and organizations that continue to support the hospital each year
5692156 programs like hospice community health education and home health provide excellent patient care and outreach directly due to support from the community
5692157 when our daughter michelle was born here in 1969 we knew we had a wonderful facility right here in lewisburg and that we would always be well cared for here
5692158 bill and i were happy to serve as annual fund chairs this year because we understand that community support of the hospital is important to ensure that people in our region get the care they need
5692159 we saw increases in giving from local businesses and our employees as well as grateful patients and our presidents associates
5692160 we are also happy to report that we raised 24 percent over the 735 000 raised last year evangelical is truly fortunate to see support like this from the people of the susquehanna valley
5692161 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5692162 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5692163 genuinely unsure about this matter he and the law should err in favor of protecting innocent life
5692164 believes that a baby in the womb lacks human rights he should say so

5692172 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5692173 this is valuable information from those most trusted members of our society who are on the front line of health care
5692174 registered nurses are helping patients in hospitals and clinics every day it makes sense to include their voices in any national debate about future health care policy
5692175 because they are fairly equally divided among ideologies and between the two predominate political parties the presidential candidate who best addresses the health care needs will win an important group of voters
5692176 the growth and momentum weve experienced in recent years allows us to attract top talent like brian weisfeld to coupons inc

5692192 for god has consigned all to disobedience that he may have mercy on all
5692193 the promise to abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs faith is null and the promise is void that is why it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made you the father of many nations in the presence of the god in whom he believed who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist
5692194 and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus

5692420 preventing infection in mri best practices for infection control in and around mri suites
5692421 any patient lying on an imaging table could be a carrier capable of contaminating surfaces in the radiology suite
5692422 mrsa and other pathogens can live on and in common mri table pads and positioners for periods as long as several months
5692423 at many mri centers there exists a false belief that merely placing a clean sheet over contaminated table pads without actually cleaning them between patients will somehow prevent the spread of infectious agents what is most concerning is that very few mri centers regularly clean their pads even once a day much less between patients
5692424 additionally almost all pad sets i have seen in use that are over a few years old are torn or frayed and should have been discarded long ago it is disgusting to see the terrible conditions of some of the pads that patients come in close contact with in these mri centers old torn and frayed pads are impossible to properly clean and are a breeding ground for bacteria
5692425 the best way i have found for patients to protect themselves is to ask to see the centers written infection control policies before their scans and visit the center if there are no written policies i can assure you that infection control has a low priority at that mri center and i would look for another mri center where infection control was taken seriously

5692597 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum

5692600 we are delighted to be working with this particular cast and are especially privileged to have the chance to work with lee blessing and maria mileaf again we could not have asked for a better group of people to depict this exceptionally thrilling piece of theatre
5692601 is a haunting drama that explores the slippery nature of reality and conviction avis and moss awake one morning in a house set in the forested hills above a picturesque body of water the weathers great the views magnificent however neither of them seems to know whose house this is or who they are will the stranger at their doorstep be able to help

5692606 the trouble with injury prone players is that they tend to get injured
5692607 were not going to be able to duplicate the things hes been able to do on the field were just going to have to pick up the pieces and fight our way through it
5692608 you can try to fight through it but it always leads to surgery
5692609 it just goes to show you that in order to win the division and win championships you have to have a little luck we havent had much of that on the injury front
5692610 theres a lot of things i still want to accomplish you prepare to play a whole season thats your goal coming into the season when its cut short you feel like you have things you still want to prove
5692611 at the same time im having a great season i guess ill just have to do it again next year
5692612 to use his lower body more and make his delivery more fluid
5692613 im not an injury prone guy and ive never had any problems throwing strikes
5692614 maybe my mechanics werent right and they just kept slipping and led to a downward spiral but at least now im on the way back up instead of holding steady where i was
5692615 technically im the no 2 receiver jason witten of course is the all world tight end and second option to t o in this offense youd have to be dumber than a fifth grader not to know that
5692616 their no 1 option was randy moss if you had him covered no 2 was donte stallworth and then theyd run plays just for their no 3 option wes welker
5692617 you dont want defenses overloading t o although i dont think 81 feels any pressure anyway
5692618 there always has to be something people worry about honestly fans only have what the media says to go off of thats the medias job
5692619 bo and braden after going through all of the tapes i feel like they have a better understanding in executing a little bit better so were going to give them the reps
5692620 well continue to give the other guys reps too but those guys will get the focus
5692621 their maturity level is well beyond what most freshmen truly are
5692622 they have that same kind of moxie that same kind of confidence and maturity that we have to see and truthfully the other players have to see too
5692623 in six of the last seven elections he who was ahead on labor day won if barack obama comes out after the sept 1 4 republican convention statistically tied with mccain hell be 15 points behind where a generic democrat should be this year
5692624 the dominant issue in this election is what you broadly call pocketbook and the economy and both candidates for some reason dont have a voice on it and they dont seem comfortable they talk about it and move off of it quickly the first one to get a voice on it will have an advantage
5692625 you are laying the foundation for the debate for the fall even if people dont pay enough attention to say im changing my vote or im making up my mind they do absorb the information
5692626 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5692627 and thats not a good look career wise sounds like cruise and his team had a five hour marathon imaging session no bathroom breaks or youre not a team player and decided his career needed to go into various new directions

5692633 this same pattern has been demonstrated in literally hundreds of studies around the world
5692634 a man who has status usually also has ambition intelligence and good social skills
5692635 to become financially and socially successful you need these other attributes

5692640 was the most attended fair in the events 154 year history
5692641 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5692642 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5692643 they are being very very strict about it weve been told that if we show any symbol of any sort we will be sent home
5692644 there are lots of issues about freedom of speech and human rights here and im willing to respect the rules
5692645 even if you have a bracelet supporting a cause you cant wear it
5692646 however they feel the olympics is about sport and not promoting issues and i understand that
5692647 my dad looks a lot more native than i do
5692648 his first language was french he and his brothers were completely bullied and ostracized in the schools they went to in northern alberta
5692649 none of the grandparents or great grandparents wanted to talk about it and when my father tried researching it the church in manitoba with all the family records had burnt down so theres a real battle even just to find out our lineage
5692650 my family is prouder of their heritage now whereas in previous generations m tis status was something they may have been ashamed about
5692651 before that i just thought of myself as a canadian athlete but hopefully now i can have some influence perhaps other aboriginals can look at me and realize how much is possible
5692652 it was the strongest field theyve ever had and i finished 11th but they denied me carding because they dont count world championships in an olympic year
5692653 when you consider she started out quite late as just an absolutely local player living in vancouver and now she is ranked on the international scene that is something
5692654 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
5692655 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
5692656 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution

5692664 its not like 20 or 30 years before so many things are changing especially the people are changing the young people are more open minded
5692665 im pretty happy i know nothing could be perfect its very important china really wants to show a good image and give the rest of the world a good impression
5692666 the need for the new rates was caused by an increase in claim costs
5692667 each customers situation is unique and not all will see an increase
5692668 it is important to recognize that our higher education system is falling behind
5692669 ive always believed that universities can make a world of difference

5692671 so of course i dont want to cut off my nose to bite my face
5692672 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5692673 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cellphones
5692674 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
5692675 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
5692676 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
5692677 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you
5692678 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5692679 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5692680 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5692681 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5692682 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5692683 of all the times for this to happen what else on earth could possibly go wrong
5692684 ill make sure that im on the lookout next time for you

5692690 for months i have called for active international engagement to resolve the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia
5692691 i made it crystal clear before at the beginning of and during this conflict that georgias territorial integrity must be respected and that georgia should be integrated into transatlantic institutions
5692692 i have condemned russian aggression and today i reiterate my demand that russia abide by the cease fire
5692693 finally we must help georgia rebuild that which has been destroyed
5692694 that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5692695 she looks better now than she ever has done im so proud i love her so much
5692696 there are a lot of people who are not here tonight but thanks to everyone who did make it
5692697 i cant believe i have reached half a century it only happens once and this is an event im glad to be sharing with you
5692698 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5692699 russia wants to be a respected international player and it can only be so if it lives up to its international commitments
5692700 i think its important that we dont pursue a policy of trying to isolate russia what we need is hard headed engagement but we will make sure its not business as usual
5692701 i dont expect that we will and nor have we sought to accelerate map for georgia
5692702 we have said that was a matter for december and we will take that up in december
5692703 great job the story selection the categories the scannability are all great
5692704 unlike so many u s papers bild was never part of a quasi monopoly that allowed complacency
5692705 is this paper too conservative culturally to do this everyone raised their hand to the affirmative talk about a reality check from that point on the conservative we cant change culture changed
5692706 bild has to prove itself at the kiosk every day
5692707 at first i thought i had pants on apparently not
5692708 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube it will give you a new way to interact with content on the go while allowing us to learn how video viewers engage with mobile advertising
5692709 there will be new monetization forms that is what we are seeking that is the holy grail when we find it it monetization is likely to be very large because of the scope and scale of youtube
5692710 were excited to explore new approaches to mobile advertising and will evaluate this test closely over the next several weeks to make sure we provide our community our partners and advertisers with the most valuable and effective mobile experience possible

5692719 for patients presenting with chest pain rapid diagnosis and the initiation of treatment can mean the difference between life and death
5692720 ask yourself this question would i rather wait more than an hour to find out if i was having a heart attack or would i want to know in 15 minutes the answer 100 percent of the time would be the sooner the better for my heart my health my life for these reasons the study findings are very significant
5692721 the i stat results got to the doctor an average of 45 minutes faster than the lab results and thats a lot of time when heart muscle is dying
5692722 this is why i stat patient side point of care testing demonstrated a trend toward reducing length of stay in the ed for both admitted and discharged patients
5692723 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience i think however we have a very cool opportunity to take spore in a few different directions too the editors are so cool and fun that we want to advance those as well as the gameplay that we put into the core game we are not shipping with the flora editor sorry its something we eventually want to get out there as it is fun to work with
5692724 what were also seeing is for the people who dont like it generally just dont get it
5692725 and its because weve created something so innovative and different its ironic it just shows that human nature of if you dont understand something you immediately attack it its pretty interesting in that regard
5692726 well guys you know what i will stop lying and just straight out say it the game sucks dont waste your money its been a wasteful 3 years of my life so dont buy it i will just get fired and move to a hobo home somewhere in la thanks for all your non support

5692741 al shabab is a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of officials affiliated to al qaeda
5692742 al shabab feels honoured to be included on the list we are good muslims and the americans are infidels we are on the right path
5692743 we are fighting a jihad to rid somalia of the ethiopians and its allies the secular somali stooges
5692744 the government now has daggers pointing at it from all directions
5692745 it is facing a multi front war with no prospect of a military victory
5692746 we urged the ethiopian military not to go into somalia
5692747 the cost for the people of mogadishu has been unacceptable
5692748 more than 600 000 people were forced from their homes in mogadishu in 2007 by fighting and the worst cereals harvest in 13 years in middle and lower shabelle traditionally the most agriculturally productive regions of the whole country
5692749 these discussions should preferably be held in a location close to somalia or in one where most observers following the situation in the country are based
5692750 i am preparing the agenda identifying a possible list of participants and the timing for this process
5692751 the somali people must create a situation that would allow the ethiopians to leave
5692752 the problem is twofold the ships themselves can get hijacked and we lose the food my biggest problem is that i cant find enough vessels that are willing to do this work for me unless they get an escort
5692753 about five masked men armed with pistols came to our camp they ordered us to get into our make shift houses and then after a few minutes we heard shots when we came out three of our men were lying there
5692754 we do not know why our colleagues were targeted but we suspect it is because they were active in the recent protests against the killings of the aid workers someone wants to silence us we do not know who
5692755 it is deplorable that amnesty international has lent itself to an obviously disgraceful smear campaign against the armed forces of ethiopia using highly emotive even racist language
5692756 we have said repeatedly that our soldiers are the most disciplined soldiers in the world
5692757 they have never cut anybodys throat never gang raped any women never deliberately shot civilians in somalia
5692758 nothing justifies gang rape slitting the throats of civilians or disproportionate attacks
5692759 a young childs throat was slit by ethiopian soldiers in front of the childs mother
5692760 the cutting of throats of even enemies is not in the tradition of ethiopian troops

5692763 in its first year trialpay surpassed the first year revenues of other high growth internet start ups such as google and amazon
5692764 in its second year trialpay is poised to double its revenues by letting shoppers pay for products from name brand merchants by completing one offer from blue chip advertisers no other payment method increases a customers willingness to pay and this unique differentiator makes trialpay one of our premier portfolio companies
5692765 a certain percentage of freeware users will never buy ad aware outright
5692766 then something like trialpay comes along to monetize free users without cannibalizing standard sales weve seen such incredible results with trialpay that we still have a hard time believing it
5692767 trialpay provides the power of choice and the benefit of a free product to turn more browsers into buyers for our merchant partners
5692768 more than 10 million users have learned that they can get a free product with every purchase through trialpay and in our current economy this unique benefit helps sellers and shoppers alike

5692771 i dont know if this is the worst humanitarian situation in the world
5692772 it may well be but it is certainly the most difficult one for the un and other aid agencies to address because of the insecurity
5692773 they were trained in afghanistan by the taliban and by osama bin laden they are al qaeda of course
5692774 what the us and everyone else says is true there are terrorists in somalia
5692775 it was an attack if we say too much then we give away platforms and things that we use
5692776 it was an attack against a known al qaeda target and militia leader in somalia
5692777 we heard a huge explosion and when we ran out of our house we saw balls of smoke and flames coming out of house
5692778 the house was totally destroyed to the ground also other houses nearby
5692779 the house that was attacked was a small concrete villa and it has been destroyed
5692780 the adjacent houses which were made from traditional mud were also destroyed the sight is quite horrific
5692781 this incident will cause a lot problems to us interests in the region and the governments who support the us by that i mean its allies who are puppets
5692782 i am letting the citizens of the us and the allies know they are not going to be safe in this area
5692783 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
5692784 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
5692785 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
5692786 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
5692787 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
5692788 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
5692789 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
5692790 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo

5692817 when he overthrew the elected government of prime minister nawaz sharif he promised to usher in real democracy yet musharrafs legacy is a tattered and divided civilian government that has been emasculated by the military a polarised and heavily armed populace a disastrous economic crisis and the newly emerged pakistani taliban
5692818 he came to power on a wave of popularity after the politicians had failed yet again but he failed to stabilise the system by rebuilding state institutions and planning for a genuine and permanent transition to sustainable democracy
5692819 musharrafs departure is certainly a watershed that brings to an end a long period of personalised military rule

5692846 the uk energy bill provisions on nuclear power do not extend to scotland this is a great success for the scottish government
5692847 the government believes it is in the public interest that new nuclear power stations should have a role to play in this countrys future energy mix alongside other low carbon sources that it would be in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations and that the government should take active steps to open up the way to the construction of new nuclear power stations
5692848 new statistics show that scotland in 2006 supplied 92 5 of its energy needs from fossil fuels renewables and pumped hydro storage
5692849 the risks and uncertainties of new nuclear power in terms of waste disposal decommissioning security and health concerns or cost are obviously far too great
5692850 the bill is actually a further strong argument for the full devolution of responsibility for energy so that we can take the right decisions for the people of scotland
5692851 we will be moving to a world in the next 25 years in which we have more than 1 000 reactors and by mid century i would expect we would have 2 000 to 3 000 reactors in the world
5692852 the nuclear proliferation danger comes not from the existence of nuclear facilities but from the intentions of those who possess them
5692853 the intent of an iran or a north korea is a geopolitical variable virtually independent of whether countries like brazil canada south africa or australia develop additional nuclear facilities
5692854 in most countries which have embraced civilian nuclear power the next step has been towards weapons
5692855 finland and south korea might be exceptions but in britain for example we built the magnox reactors to equip nuclear armed bombers and submarines and to say theres no reason to be concerned about the spread of civilian nuclear power is complacent to the point of being foolhardy
5692856 he obviously hasnt got a clue about the detail of the nuclear cycle its all very well to stand back and make these wild statements but theres a big difference between wishes and reality
5692857 if we look at the amount of what are called conventional resources thats uranium known to be in the ground which is well described there would be enough at current rates of use to last for 85 years
5692858 isnt there a danger with new nuclear that we are going to lock ourselves in rigidly to a technology for the best part of a century when other technologies like carbon capture and storage like renewables are evolving practically every day
5692859 i cant decide whether new nuclear is a white elephant or a red herring
5692860 but very clearly what it isnt is the answer to the energy problems we face today
5692861 im all in favour of reducing emissions i think we can start with what comes out of your mouth
5692862 whats absolutely transparent from your contribution is that what we need and could benefit from in this house is some fresh thinking not a rehash of all the old prejudices that have confused this debate for so long
5692863 the trial courts ruling left defendant physicians free to later offer evidence at trial that their religious objections were to participating in the medical insemination of an unmarried woman and were not based on plaintiffs sexual orientation
5692864 the trial courts ruling simply narrowed the issues in this case by disposing of defendants contention that their constitutional rights to free speech and the free exercise of religion exempt them from complying with the unruh civil rights acts prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination
5692865 it is the charter schools that will get the public to demand that the rest of them come up
5692866 it is a matter for the power companies to bring forward proposals on the basis that there will be no public subsidies
5692867 very unlikely circumstances of an emergency at a nuclear plant
5692868 we have made it clear that once the right frameworks are in place we will be in a position to move fast move first and move safe
5692869 in this countrys future energy mix alongside other low carbon sources
5692870 affordable and provides one of the cheapest electricity options available to reduce our carbon emissions
5692871 on no account should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power
5692872 for the best part of a century when other technologies like carbon capture and storage like renewables are evolving practically every day
5692873 i cant decide whether new nuclear is a white elephant or a red herring but very clearly what it isnt is the answer to the energy problems we face today
5692874 this is bad news for britains energy security and bad news for our efforts to beat climate change

5692878 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition force for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
5692879 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
5692880 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
5692881 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
5692882 no matter how big or small our operations might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
5692883 despite the best of intentions it is impossible to change the minds of everyone but every little bit helps each new gesture that makes a difference is another step closer to permanent change
5692884 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
5692885 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal operations have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach

5692893 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming

5692917 i would expect them to begin to consolidate the industry which is extremely fragmented
5692918 management has been quite vocal about the need and desire to consolidate the industry
5692919 as market growth slows down competitive intensity increases putting pressure on operating margins telecommunications operators in eastern europe will face increasing pressure to consolidate in an ambition to realize cost savings or to simply take a competitor off the market
5692920 operators that are currently benefiting from many years of strong revenue growth will start to feel the pressure to realize savings by taking over others we can therefore expect a new wave of cross border and intranational mergers in eastern europe as we have been observing in western europe for several years already

5692939 factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion
5692940 take account of several different considerations of which conflict of interest is one
5692941 the mere fact that benefit claims are decided by a paid human resources administrator who works for the defendant corporation does not without more suffice to create an inherent conflict of interest were that enough there would be a near presumption of a conflict of interest in every case in which an employer both offers a plan and pays someone to administer it making a full application of the abuse of discretion standard the exception not the rule
5692942 the fact that a plan administrator both evaluates claims for benefits and pays benefits claims creates the kind of conflict of interest

5693013 darryls amazing documentary provides an important medium for our message and we hope to reach a wide audience through this important partnership
5693014 the ywca has been at the forefront of womens issues in this country for the past 150 years and we are prepared to raise awareness and ignite a national dialogue about this issue as the first steps to changing american culture and helping women reclaim wholesome and healthy beauty

5693092 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5693093 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5693094 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5693095 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5693096 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5693121 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5693122 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5693123 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5693124 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5693125 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5693126 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5693127 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5693128 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5693129 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5693130 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5693131 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5693132 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5693133 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5693134 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5693135 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5693136 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5693137 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5693138 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5693139 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here

5693161 i think that maybe lauren is tired of being on the show but were just beginning
5693162 the show is definitely reaching its end its been so amazing and ive loved most of it but i think there is going to come a time where i need to live my life for myself and not in front of viewers im young and having fun with it now but its not something i am going to be able to do forever obviously
5693163 if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
5693164 its a bit sad to be honest its a great big cry for help and people need to stop talking about her and you know maybe all she needs is a hug
5693165 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support barack obama a man of color for the leader of the free world
5693166 state of israel from the standpoint of security should include west bank
5693167 to tell jewish people they cant live in a jewish state is like telling the boston red sox that they cant play in fenway park
5693168 my position on jerusalem does not stem from religious beliefs but is based on common sense its unrealistic to have two governments on the same street
5693169 you cant have multiple jurisdictions on top of each other
5693170 its impractical and irrational to have two governments overseeing the same real estate and with hamas terrorists it complicates it even more
5693171 its a delicate issue and we shouldnt forget that it took women and african americans 150 years to get the vote in the usa
5693172 no indication that im on the list id be very surprised if i were picked
5693173 that was barack obama he just tripped off a chair and someone pointed a gun at him and he dove for the floor
5693174 john mccain understands this part of the world very clearly
5693175 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
5693176 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5693177 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
5693178 john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5693179 quite apart from the problems arising when you try to edit your own work many journalists do not write great english and rely on the subs desk to do rewrites and most do not have the comprehensive understanding of media law that subs do but have only a limited working knowledge of libel law
5693180 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5693181 we really need to take a good hard look at whats going on in these organizations
5693182 lose on average 6 percent of their revenue to fraud every year
5693183 determining how much theft and embezzlement takes place has been the holy grail of the sector
5693184 theyre lumping all those sectors together and it could be that the for profit sector experiences a higher level of fraud while the nonprofit sector and government experience lower levels
5693185 even if the figure is 20 billion thats still a huge amount and needs to be addressed
5693186 most of these things are not caught by routine audits
5693187 theyre usually done by someone in the financial area the treasurer the bookkeeper the signer of checks who knows how to avoid getting caught
5693188 i gave a talk to a group of nonprofit executives a few weeks ago and every single one of them had a fraud story to tell
5693189 this has been going on for years but theres a feeling that it shouldnt be discussed
5693190 that they dont have a great deal of faith in the way these groups handle money
5693191 not only will that eventually give us a much better idea of how widespread fraud is with these groups it also gives them an incentive to have better financial controls
5693192 because its an extreme example of something typical that no one gets in trouble for this
5693193 theyre creating audit committees and adopting the provisions of sarbanes oxley as best practices
5693194 it may be curtains soon for the management and shareholders of beleaguered housing giants fannie mae and freddie mac
5693195 such a move would almost certainly wipe out existing holders of the agencies common stock
5693196 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5693197 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5693198 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5693199 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5693200 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5693201 when the cars started to be produced elsewhere and the television sets and the socks and everything else
5693202 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
5693203 most us consumers are happy with dvds according to a recent study by abi research and dont believe blu ray provides as big of a quality jump as dvds did over vhs tapes

5693221 vermoedelijk omdat beleggen in vastrentende waarden minder aantrekkelijk is geworden door de stijgende inflatie
5693222 ze merken het effect van de ontwikkelingen van de internationale onroerendgoedmarkten
5693223 onvermijdelijk gaat ook de haven het effect merken van de wegzakkende groei in vooral azi
5693224 we hebben goed gekeken naar de bezwaren maar daar zitten geen nieuwe argumenten bij
5693225 daarom hebben we alle vertrouwen in een goede afloop we beginnen met de aanleg op 1 september tegen de tijd dat we hier een hele baggervloot hebben weten we de uitslag van de procedures
5693226 over enkele jaren zal de groei weer aantrekken en dan hebben we de tweede maasvlakte hard nodig
5693227 our hours are from 7 a m to 5 p m pacific time
5693228 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
5693229 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
5693230 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
5693231 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
5693232 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
5693233 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
5693234 we sacrificed a little bit of space but its still comfortable
5693235 is poised to go national with the fox television stations in mid 2009
5693236 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5693237 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism
5693238 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5693239 musharrafs departure signals the end of a de facto presidential form of government in pakistan
5693240 he had concentrated power in his own hands by virtue of the fact that he was also head of the military
5693241 both the pakistanis and the americans are going to have to decide what kind of policies they follow with regard to foreign affairs and economics and that will depend in no small measure on the attitude that the us congress and a new us president will bring to the entire region
5693242 i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
5693243 i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally

5693250 ik zat goed in mijn vel was niet zenuwachtig en zag het ook niet aankomen ik kan me ook niet meer heugen dat zoiets is gebeurd dat het juist nu gebeurt is zuur
5693251 als ik was blijven hangen was een podiumplek zeker mogelijk geweest het geeft een goed gevoel dat je op het hoogste niveau meedoet aan de andere kant is het zuur dat je een medaille laat glippen
5693252 thats why i extended health care for wounded troops who had been neglected
5693253 we looked into the legislative history of the bill and found that obama and mccaskill can at least take some credit for developing the list of requirements its not a major extension of benefits however if obama had said he had helped extend health care for wounded veterans whod been neglected we woul d have given him a better rating but he phrased his accomplishment to take more of the credit than that missing the vote on the 2008 bill does not help his case
5693254 obama goes on to tout his legislative accomplishments and those claims dont stand up as well under scrutiny the only national law in obamas ad is the one that extended health care for wounded troops and its dubious whether he can claim full responsibility for that one h r 4986 which became public law 110 181 in 2008 includes provisions from several obama sponsored bills his ideas made it into law but obama was not a sponsor or cosponsor of h r 4986 itself
5693255 obama made the assertion in a new ad running in 18 states including usually republican indiana alaska and georgia and critics are calling it a stretch because as was quickly pointed out obama had a small hand in the measures both in the illinois and us senate and didnt even vote on one he cited
5693256 when you go to the rio grande valley you will face questions because the area has a great many veterans for whom the veterans administration is their only health care yet the closest va hospitals are here in san antonio they have to travel upwards of 200 miles to get care
5693257 if they have to drive five or six hours for full care i am glad i have learned about it because i want to fully investigate this
5693258 in illinois we have a significant rural population who live a long distance away from the nearest metropolitan area where the usdva typically locates its veterans service centers clinics and hospitals this poses a significant access issue for our veterans v eterans still often have to travel a long distance in order to obtain care often involving multiple overnights away from home as they wait for the various once a day shuttle bus services
5693259 one such example is the danville va hospital in central illinois that routinely denies veterans access to their local physicians for procedures as simple as a chest x ray the veteran is instead force d to take once a day shuttles to pick up points for a second shuttle if one misses any of the shuttles one must stay overnight out of ones own pocket to catch the next days shuttle when they finally reach danville it is a common experience for a veteran to wait 4 hours to see a medical professional followed by another three four hour wait for pharmacy services in the end it is not unheard of for a veteran to spend three or four nights away from home for a single doctors visit

5693278 jade had some tests recently then she went off to india to appear in the indian big brother
5693279 yesterday we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer of the cervix and so she has to come back straight away
5693280 we put the consultant in touch with the programme maker in india and because of the circumstances was allowed to speak to her and explain the results of her tests
5693281 the important thing is to get her back as soon as possible and get this treated
5693282 obviously there were some problems thats why she had tests but she had no idea that would be the diagnosis she was shocked
5693283 neutral peacekeeping force in georgia because russia is clearly party to this conflict
5693284 russian peacekeepers have engaged in wanton destruction and this has isolated russia the us has not isolated russia
5693285 the use of force is not a basis to redraw the map of countries around russia
5693286 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5693287 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of russian president dmitry medvedev to abide by the peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5693288 it is now in the hands of russia to take action russia should adhere to the six point plan and russians should go back to their positions on august 6th
5693289 i should add we will certainly not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia the future will depend on concrete actions on the russian side
5693290 which can be seen as the same kind of consultation mechanism we have with our other partner ukraine
5693291 georgia is a sovereign country with a democratically elected government at the moment that principle is not accepted by some
5693292 there was very strong language around the table of the need for russia to honour the ceasefire commitment that its president has undertaken
5693293 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces from georgia back to the august 6th 7th status quo ante

5693300 this same pattern has been demonstrated in literally hundreds of studies around the world
5693301 a man who has status usually also has ambition intelligence and good social skills
5693302 to become financially and socially successful you need these other attributes

5693304 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power

5693307 a return to low inflation will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5693308 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs

5693311 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations
5693312 currently autism diagnosis is purely behaviour based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities
5693313 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5693314 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions

5693328 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5693329 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5693330 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5693331 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5693332 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5693333 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5693334 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5693335 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory

5693354 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
5693355 all of the empirical studies published in english in peer reviewed journals since 1989 that compared the mental health of women who had an induced abortion to comparison groups of women or that examined factors that predict mental health among women who have had an elective abortion in the united states
5693356 women terminating a wanted pregnancy who perceived pressure from others to terminate their pregnancy or who perceived a need to keep their abortion secret from their family and friends because of stigma associated with abortion were more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following abortion

5693370 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5693371 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later

5693379 a follower of god showed love for god and others by extending hospitality to complete strangers in addition though it was not the primary motivation some followers of god likely were motivated to extend hospitality to strangers by their desire to cultivate gods blessings upon their own lives and households
5693380 let mutual love continue do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it
5693381 rather than shunning strangers jesus disciples would do well to journey alongside them rather than exclusively speaking to those they encounter along lifes journeys jesus disciples would do well to listen first rather than deeming others to be foolish ignorant and of no benefit jesus disciples would do well to assume that god might have revealed himself to strangers rather than taking things at face value jesus disciples should realize that the spirit is at work in the world around them

5693384 such hospitality indicates the crossing of boundaries ethnic origin economic condition political orientation gender status social experience educational background by being open and welcoming of the other without such communities of hospitality the world will have no way of knowing that all gods creation is meant to live in peace

5693395 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off

5693424 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth
5693425 i think everyone loves the novelty of a robot that can pour beer weve had a few bartenders who have said with this guy on the scene my jobs in danger but given that he cost 100 000 to make it may be a while before that happens
5693426 hes been pretty reliable so far its just a matter of making sure the beer cooler is on and that hes booted up properly before serving
5693427 a major part of bartending is the social skills being able to read the customer and engage in conversation know when theyre getting ready for another drink its down to the personal touch the way you handle the glass and mix the cocktail
5693428 certainly i have to say bravo to the people who created a robot that can bartend its quite something to have invented such a complex machine but i think human bar staff jobs are quite safe
5693429 when you work behind a bar youre involving yourself in somebodys life
5693430 and while a robot might be sitting there smiling as its pouring your drink and doing it really quickly theres nothing better than being met at the bar by somebody who has a genuine smile on their face and can engage with you properly
5693431 having a robot bartender would be a novelty it would be fun to see one of them in the bar and experience being served by it but it would be a gimmicky thing

5693444 we could have won that match after being in control until the middle overs

5693447 dan moeten de oorzaken gedefinieerd worden zijn dit effectief factoren die te maken met vrouwonvriendelijkheid en lijden de vrouwen effectief aan minority stress pas dan kan gezocht worden naar maatregelen om meer vrouwen naar de centra te leiden om daar de noodzakelijke op maat gesneden gespecialiseerde zorg en hulpverlening te vinden
5693448 ik denk dat we nog meer inspanningen moeten leveren om de drempel te verlagen voor alleenstaande ouders met kinderen maar dit geldt voor alle soorten hulpverlening en ook voor alleenstaande vaders

5693451 in tegenstelling tot de openingsrace waarin ieder team sowieso naar de volgende ronde ging is er nu wel druk op de ketel en dat hebben we net nodig om ons optimaal te kunnen focussen het was drie maand geleden dat we een race vaarden zodat we maandag duidelijk scherpte en ritme misten die extra wedstrijd zal ons goed doen al moeten we er uiteraard voor zorgen dat we binnen de eerste drie eindigen anders zit het tornooi er voor ons al op en daaraan wil ik niet denken
5693452 als we vierde kunnen finishen in een loodzware voorwedstrijd en daarin op slechts drie seconden strandden van de regerende wereldkampioenen colin carr lijkt het me normaal dat we voor deze halve finalerace voluit in onze kansen geloven we hadden gisteren al een goed gevoel en moeten dat nu met een finaleplaats kunnen concretiseren tenslotte hadden we ook de tweede snelste tijd op de zeven boten die morgen om de laatste drie finaletickets zullen knokken

5693517 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5693518 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5693519 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5693520 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part

5693537 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
5693538 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
5693539 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
5693540 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
5693541 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
5693542 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
5693543 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
5693544 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
5693545 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
5693546 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
5693547 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
5693548 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
5693549 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
5693550 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
5693551 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
5693552 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
5693553 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
5693554 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
5693555 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
5693556 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
5693557 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
5693558 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
5693559 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players

5693562 some business owners thought a quarter a beer was unreasonable and irresponsible
5693563 it was peer pressure where responsible business owners put pressure on other business owners
5693564 when you take cheap drink specials and college kids looking to have a good time the result isnt always great anything we can do to be more responsible im all for that
5693565 when you have two gas stations on a corner they cant decide to set the price at x number of dollars per gallon
5693566 to me its the same thing the other bars around here werent happy so they all got together and tried to set a minimum drink price
5693567 i mean just because its 75 cents that doesnt make people who dont drink drink
5693568 if people are going to drink theyre going to just pay for it no matter how expensive it is
5693569 when i came to the bar and it was 25 cents i drank the same amount as before when drinks were a dollar
5693570 its just i was able to leave after only spending a couple dollars
5693571 i was a student once and i was poor and i was always happy to get things cheaper

5693577 it is crappy demo but so what it is only a demo for gods sake it does not give you a clear picture of our next album because next album is gonna be darkest to die for album ever melancholy rock from the bottom of our hearts so we do are not sure is this gonna be ever released anywhere but we just wanted give you some clips to listen before you get bored or before you die
5693578 our contract with spinefarm expired and maybe there was a possibility to continue with them i do not know but we decided to start to looking for something new spinefarm records is ok but it seems like they have no interest or time for band like we are they have too many bands to handle thats why we felt like we are not getting enough things like promotion etc there are some labels who are interested in us but this time we are not gonna hurry we need a company who is ready to work for us with huge motivation at the moment i am writing new songs for to die for also other guys are writing new stuff we are gonna be alive in the future more than ever
5693579 to all the fans that have been patiently awaiting for the upcoming release of sentinel beast s second full length risen we would like to report that the recording process has been going very well we are very eager for the new release as it has been 22 years since the thrash defining depths of death and we feel this album is nothing less than a crushing masterpiece that will melt faces and help put sentinel beast back on the metal map as a thrash pioneer
5693580 i think theres a real argument that they should probably have a higher rate than perhaps councillors would
5693581 all have said theres a moment where you just stand where were working and are truly humbled at the fact that we get to work in a building that is so teacher friendly and earth friendly
5693582 they are cheaper to own environmentally responsible efficient its the right direction to take
5693583 because of the efficiency of the building we expect to recoup savings
5693584 im excited about seeing kids come into the building and the applications it will have to learning and teaching
5693585 it will help us teach how were a global community to work outside in the community and look outside themselves
5693586 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
5693587 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
5693588 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
5693589 then look for items made out of recycled content like cotton hemp bamboo and cork and try to stay away from plastics you can get substitutes for all kinds of items like hangers and rugs
5693590 go more organic for bedding and towels like 100 percent cotton they cost more and dont always come in the extra long twin for dorm rooms but you can opt for an organic pillow at least
5693591 students can decorate their dorms with items purchased from goodwill vintage shops and the online classified site craigslist and many schools have recycling programs whereby items kids didnt take home with them last year are available to students for this school year like chairs and appliances
5693592 you dont have to bring a microwave and refrigerator as these are usually available in the common area so are tvs and dvd players
5693593 its all about using less energy and if you do have your own appliances keep them on power save mode
5693594 its not always easy for a college student to afford eco friendly items and its hard to find them even if they are affordable so i do what i can
5693595 its really a matter of changing habits in ways that dont cost much for instance i use as little water as possible when taking a shower or washing dishes i never buy plastic water bottles and instead have a reusable aluminum bottle and fill it with tap water i have reusable canvas bags for shopping and i try to rely on my bike for transportation
5693596 the less packaging the better so we reduce the amount of plastics being used and trash
5693597 its really about a student lifestyle change and habits that can be a challenge at first but ultimately arent difficult to adopt
5693598 its not always easy to convince your roommates to go green too
5693599 but its good to educate them anyway about actions like recycling and turning off the computer when not in use over time they see its the right thing to do

5693623 shifting less than one day per weeks worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken fish eggs or a vegetable based diet achieves more ghg reduction than buying all locally sourced food
5693624 also the amount of food that is produced still leaves plenty of time for art and other cultural activities in the community as a whole come to think of it food used to be a cultural activity until we turned it into an industry
5693625 many people who grew food to sell it mind you used to be stuck in poverty and had to always worry about starving
5693626 the environmental benefits of substituting local vegetables for global vegetables are likely to be negligible
5693627 externalities are so key to the equation and yet so ignored they were briefly mentioned in arts piece but in the context of transportation costs and food alone if people knew what they were paying for a given product and sought to avoid or minimize the costs incurred there would be a monumental shift in personal spending

5693633 theres not really someone who comes to mind as a potential superstar
5693634 we have a lot of good players in this country but none of them are great some of them might look good in the premiership but they get found wanting at international level because the standard of the psl is not great
5693635 the lack of expertise and the development of talented strikers is a big problem when i played abroad i had lots of help and got loads of sound technical advice we got specialised coaching and my game improved a lot
5693636 i still believe zuma is a better midfield player than a striker he is great with the ball going forward and he can score the odd goal for you we have a lot of players like that in south africa
5693637 because these players tend to score their fair share of goals coaches try to turn them into strikers however they then struggle in the position lose confidence and struggle to make the same impact

5693778 the air district cant keep giving away air pollution credits that dont exist in the first place especially in the dirtiest air basin in the country
5693779 it is unfortunate that the very agency charged with protecting our air continues to pollute it
5693780 for decades the air district has given out credits to countless polluters without bothering to keep track of where the credits came from where they went and whether they had enough credits to cover all the emissions they were allowing
5693781 we are asking the court to stop this practice immediately and force the air district to clean up the air in the communities that hosted the unlawful pollution
5693782 people living in the south coast air basin should not be forced to sacrifice their familys health and lives breathing dirty air justified with fraudulent credits
5693783 the polluting facilities accessing these credits can afford the best pollution control technologies but choose to make higher profits and choose to locate these facilities in low income and poor communities that can ill afford any more pollution
5693784 in south east los angeles where there are lots of polluting facilities we look to the district to ensure that companies are operating in compliance with air quality laws and protecting public health

5693805 its honestly hard to judge a world that you dont know i think for hollywood and for the acting world i was sort of like oh my gosh whats this going to mean to me if im going to do a videogame i sort of thought about it for a while
5693806 everyone ive mentioned it to honestly actors directors producers people ive worked with
5693807 i think theres still snobbery i think theres still a massive misunderstanding about what the work actually is
5693808 do i think people are going to be critical well people already have people were critical about the game before theyd even played it so i dont think thats necessarily going to change
5693809 i think if people see the game for what it is and review the game for what it is then itll get a good reception
5693810 its a solid game weve made a lot of games we stand behind it and we wouldnt release a game until its ready so we feel really good about that
5693811 i think the reception of the demo speaks for itself
5693812 are there people who dont like it well no one likes every game but in the end if were going to worry about critical reviews then were in the wrong industry
5693813 what i and i think people at silicon knights are more concerned with are when people play the game are they having a fun time and do they feel theyre being entertained and thats all that matters
5693814 last year we announced the program to offer triple a game developers a version of ai implant essentially at no cost to allow us to grow the product for the other markets in which we sell it primarily modelling and simulation

5693830 when we went to submit our application they made inquiries about the situation and wanted me to sign those instead and they refused to take the form from me
5693831 the staff member said that our application was not accepted because they cannot grant it the first time we apply
5693832 instead we should wait to see if we can mediate the issue and if that doesnt work we can try to submit an application a second time
5693833 from this perspective the system is really just a means to supervise demonstrations
5693834 in some districts they may have been paid 2 000 yuan u s 290 to pledge that they will not protest during the olympics but in others they may have to report in once a week to collect their payment
5693835 still others may have to report every afternoon to prove that they have not left shanghai and receive 50 yuan
5693836 on aug 7 i went to apply but was immediately refused on aug 8 which was the day of the opening ceremonies i thought perhaps there would be a change
5693837 i went again to apply but i was simply told that i couldnt hold a demonstration about this issue
5693838 they said that i shouldnt speak about this complaint and that it was not a matter of it being accepted or not but that it would be treated as a non issue
5693839 at long last our country now has this policy whereby we can protest we have to take advantage of this one opportunity to voice our own opinions
5693840 we can do this and stay in accordance with regulations but instead they are refusing to entertain the idea and so it is like a vase on a table pretty to look at but useless
5693841 chinese people are not afforded this human right if these promises were true they would truly be accepting applications for complaints
5693842 its a lie i know its a lie because i myself submitted the applications a lot of people can bear witness to that fact i followed the standard procedure they refused to take our application then they told us to withdraw our submission

5693846 we have just completed the test on asifs b sample and it has come back positive
5693847 but i can tell you that the quantity of nandrolone has varied which we can contest
5693848 all brown skinned folks must know are related to each other she made an assumption about all of you based on age too
5693849 in what way do i look like random celeb i do not look like i got queen latifah once
5693850 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5693851 especially considering the sort of players weve got in the squad to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5693852 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5693853 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5693854 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5693855 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it its up to other people to say if im a role model but i wear my heart on my sleeve and give everything for the team
5693856 i think it is a chance to make amends to get another chance now its in my arms and the players to do better
5693857 weve certainly got the players and manager to do that
5693858 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5693859 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5693860 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players rio is a good player and i like him as a captain
5693861 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5693862 i think that showed the manager what kind of character i am to bounce back the way i did after that huge disappointment showed my character maybe that persuaded him
5693863 he gave me a huge boost by giving me the armband in that match i went on the pitch played well and scored the goal it helped to relieve it a bit
5693864 i like to show what i can do on and off the pitch it makes me very proud to think that the likes of capello jose mourinho and luiz felipe scolari have seen something in me to give me the captaincy its very special
5693865 yesterday 10 of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan 21 others were wounded during a joint reconnaissance mission with the afghan national army

5693869 the all blacks have some great tactical kickers so in a sense we had to slow the game down last week
5693870 the aussies dont have great tactical kickers and we have to speed things up thats why weve gone with jantjes
5693871 i think fourie does have a yard or two on ricky other than that i dont think theres much difference between the two
5693872 hed be great to play against hes a fantastic player one of the best players obviously getting around as a winger
5693873 im kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea but we cant back off now

5693875 in playing total rugby there is going to be a fear factor
5693876 theyll see us as a different proposition than the all blacks and theyll identify some things that they think will work for them

5693904 i feel that first and foremost the task force report is biased and lacks credibility given the fact that the study they relied upon most is a study that was co authored by one of the people on the panel
5693905 the silent no more awareness campaign offered them our testimonies offered to meet with them
5693906 they chose not to listen to any of the voices of those who have firsthand experience with this particular issue that theyre caring to address

5693914 i like to tell people you wouldnt want your church buying an abortion clinic to make money to give to the poor the idea is appalling
5693915 but the church is the people not the building and using the money that gods entrusted to you to buy a company that supports abortion or pornography just to make a profit even for the best intentions whether its for retirement or just to support your family is right along the same lines
5693916 we screen for involvement in abortion embryonic stem cell research adult entertainment alcohol tobacco and immoral lifestyles
5693917 while crop prices are down from the records we saw in the first quarter they remain at very high levels
5693918 growers are still facing rising input costs for items including fertilizer and fuel as a result leading growers in the u s and international markets are turning to precision agriculture products which increase their crop yield while holding down expenses this is the niche flow controls serves and why its products are in such demand the triple digit increase in operating income for this business and for our smaller aerostar operation more than offset lower profits in engineered films and electronic systems which still are managing the headwinds from slow construction and home improvement markets
5693919 this has truly been a good news bad news period for engineered films
5693920 we have seen continued strong demand from the oil and gas industry especially for pit liners used in exploration drilling we also are experiencing a good deal of interest in two of our new products the vaporblock plus tm radon barrier and fortresspro tm house wrap which offers superior air and water protection builders choose these products because they wish to differentiate themselves by using higher quality materials but the construction market continues to be a weak one add to this the increasing costs of resin and a higher level of depreciation from additional capacity in the last few years and the result is a lower margin
5693921 we have developed the right product portfolio to capitalize on a strong market
5693922 while there is competition for each of our products the breadth of products we offer makes us attractive to distributors because we can provide everything they need while we didnt introduce any new products during the quarter our entry level gps guidance system the cruizer tm continued to perform ahead of expectations as did our entire sprayer line we are optimizing capacity by outsourcing some manufacturing to our electronic systems division and other vendors and by offering additional sales promotions for early summer shipments which is expected to moderate demands on our people and facilities during an anticipated busy fall season
5693923 the same issues we faced for the last few quarters are still present
5693924 soft markets for new home construction and home improvements negatively affected our bed controls business we also lost a significant account when that company was acquired some of this business has been replaced with lower margin products for avionics and by supplying circuit boards to flow controls electronic systems has strong manufacturing processes and controls resulting from our focus on six sigma however until we can increase profit margins we are reducing our footprint here that includes consolidating our two sioux falls manufacturing facilities into one which will be completed in september improving throughput and lowering inventories for the near term we are managing costs and expenses to maximize cash flow from this business
5693925 sales increased with higher shipments of mc 6 parachutes to the army which we did not have a year ago
5693926 sales related to another contract for fuel handler coveralls also are new this year we are working to qualify for follow on parachute orders targeted at other areas of the military
5693927 we expect to leverage the solid market for flow controls products in several ways
5693928 this includes introducing extensions of our existing product line and expanding international sales in part due to building a stronger international sales team
5693929 because last years third quarter was especially strong for electronic systems we know its results will be much lower by comparison this year
5693930 we are working hard to get profitability back to acceptable levels before initiating any programs to add new business
5693931 all of our businesses are in a good position to capitalize on market opportunities
5693932 flow controls and aerostar should continue to improve although their rate of growth will likely moderate engineered films and electronic systems could start showing improvement by the end of the year as a result the third quarter should generate single digit year over year net income growth followed by a stronger fourth quarter increase that combination will lead to record sales and earnings for the year

5693950 it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5693951 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5693952 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5693953 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5693954 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
5693955 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5693956 ive watched her have a mastectomy and then ive watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hyterectomy ive watched this woman survive both those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be ok no matter what
5693957 if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this
5693958 so for me one of the things that when this is all happened was that im putting together a program thats going to raise money to pay for mris for women who are at high risk
5693959 were also going to pay for the brca testing because thats very very expensive
5693960 you know i really love living and i really love my life i knew from this moment on it was only going to be good and that was going to be coming
5693961 yea im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say ive got to i have to get out there and and make this positive
5693962 and you know im going to have cute boobs till im 90

5693975 indias number one davis cupper leander paes informed anil khanna executive vice president and secretary general in a meeting held in beijing just after the tennis event that he would like to step down as captain of the indian davis cup team for the tie against romania
5693976 he wanted the best davis cup team to represent the nation and did not want to leave any doubt in anyones mind for their non participation to represent the country in the biggest team event
5693977 somdev has been picked on the basis of his recent performance leander and mahesh being our best doubles players picked themselves into the squad but rohan has not been selected because prakash and somdev are in better form and are ranked higher than him
5693978 of course rohan is more experienced but somdev is in great form and we thought he would be a better choice current form and performance were the only criteria while selecting the team

5693989 het gaat hier om een advocaat die een zware berisping heeft gehad van de deken van advocaten
5693990 het maken van beschrijvingen is volgens google volledig geautomatiseerd het is volgens google niet mogelijk om aanpassingen in de zoekresultaten aan te brengen voor individuele sites
5693991 dit begint echt hilarische vormen aan te nemen nog afgezien van de vraag of mijnheer scheltema dit zo hoog moet opnemen is dit bij uitstek een combinatie van formuleringen die bij google optreedt en niet op miljoenhuizen nl en klup nl
5693992 helaas is de spider van google nog niet in de staat om de relatie van woorden in een tekst te begrijpen voor google is een webpagina gewoon een bak met woorden en als linksboven de naam f j scheltema staat en rechtsonder het woord berisping dan voegt google deze moeiteloos samen alsof er een verband is de suggestie die google deed om de feedback over een andere advocaat alleen op een andere pagina te plaatsen is hetzelfde als tegen een krant zeggen dat ze maar n artikel per pagina mogen publiceren
5693993 dit is al vervelend genoeg voor mijnheer scheltema ik verzoek u dringend om zijn naam niet te noemen in een artikel
5693994 no fewer than 184 new mosques some with domes and minarets are currently being built or planned throughout thats considerably more than the 163 existing traditional mosques along with around 2 600 prayer rooms mostly hidden within secular buildings
5693995 the minarets are our lances the domes our helmets the believers our army
5693996 the result is that greater pressure is placed on women and even more children are forced to wear a headscarf to school which leads to isolation
5693997 i think german baptists should respond to the building campaign in terms of religious freedom i e keeping in mind that in the 19th century germany baptists and other religious fringe groups then called sects coped with the same problems as muslims today like zoning laws
5693998 in baptists were not allowed to build their houses of worship on the street but only in the backyards so that they could not be seen in my opinion this has caused what i have often called a backyard mentality among baptists which was felt until a generation ago sometimes even today
5693999 the social marginalization has had a long term effect if baptists were more conscious of their history they would more generally see this parallel but i am afraid that most baptists would voice their opposition to the building campaign because there is among evangelicals a strange fear of muslims
5694000 i think that they should have the right to build representative buildings mosques where muslims can gather i also think that they should have the right to teach muslim pupils in their religion at schools as protestants and catholics do it in germany
5694001 it is quite true that a turkish parallel society developed in some major cities in some quarters of the cities young people can learn a trade older folks can go shopping do their banking live their lives until they die without ever having to speak one word of german it goes without saying that german people in such neighborhoods feel as though they were strangers in their own land
5694002 i ask for the opening without further delays of humanitarian corridors between the region of southern ossetia and the rest of
5694003 it may really be ironically that in november we may look back at this event and end up concluding that this was one of the defining moments of the campaign
5694004 if this was the evangelical version of the game show jeopardy then that was the daily double and mccain wagered it all and came up with the correct answer at least according to evangelicals
5694005 mccain had a lot to lose at saddleback saturday night
5694006 his advisers tell me he knew how important this night was and he showed up big time we will see how this performance plays within the evangelical community but my hunch is that it will play very well mccains stock is on the upswing
5694007 john mccain without hesitation bang life begins at conception he gets it
5694008 the judges that he would appoint he made it very very clear i think he also resonated with beyond the base to those who are pro life even within the democratic party i think it was exactly what needed to be done he said it exactly the way it needed to be said
5694009 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer was extremely weak and shows up the hypocrisy in his position on that issue
5694010 i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage
5694011 he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage and so he needs to keep twisting and turning diving on that issue and it is hypocritical
5694012 thats something that redefined marriage that undermines the institution that is the foundation of society
5694013 and barack obama is wrong on it and that did not come out as clearly as it should have
5694014 its absurd its an absurd hypocritical position and he needs to be called on that
5694015 the issue for him is whether he will steward this unusual influence that hes been given in the right way that honors god so that on the great day that the lord will say as we all want to hear said well done thou good and faithful servant
5694016 our kids cant pray in public school or read the bible or learn to apply traditional values in managing their lives the ten commandments cannot appear in our courthouses a cr che cannot be displayed in a public space during christmas
5694017 yet somehow we think a church is an appropriate forum for hosting candidates for president
5694018 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
5694019 were electing a president not a national pastor i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5694020 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs

5694022 they have the sheer pig headed arrogance to speak about the territorial integrity of was invaded outside any norm of international law its civilian structures were targeted with military hardware and reconstruction contracts were doled out without tender to white house cronies

5694046 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5694047 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

5694082 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5694083 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter

5694135 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5694136 especially considering the sort of players weve got in the squad to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5694137 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5694138 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5694139 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5694140 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it its up to other people to say if im a role model but i wear my heart on my sleeve and give everything for the team
5694141 i think it is a chance to make amends to get another chance now its in my arms and the players to do better
5694142 weve certainly got the players and manager to do that
5694143 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5694144 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5694145 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players rio is a good player and i like him as a captain
5694146 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5694147 i think that showed the manager what kind of character i am to bounce back the way i did after that huge disappointment showed my character maybe that persuaded him
5694148 he gave me a huge boost by giving me the armband in that match i went on the pitch played well and scored the goal it helped to relieve it a bit
5694149 i like to show what i can do on and off the pitch it makes me very proud to think that the likes of capello jose mourinho and luiz felipe scolari have seen something in me to give me the captaincy its very special
5694150 the all blacks have some great tactical kickers so in a sense we had to slow the game down last week
5694151 the aussies dont have great tactical kickers and we have to speed things up thats why weve gone with jantjes
5694152 i think fourie does have a yard or two on ricky other than that i dont think theres much difference between the two
5694153 hed be great to play against hes a fantastic player one of the best players obviously getting around as a winger
5694154 im kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea but we cant back off now
5694155 were at 60 per cent of where we want to be so we have to bite the bullet and see if we can get there

5694159 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance
5694160 a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths
5694161 if heparin is prepared the right way it should be consistent and safe even from an animal source
5694162 our biotech version of heparin will be prepared in a controlled environment ensuring that it is pure and free of contaminants
5694163 we are pleased to see that the mva based candidate tested in chennai was safe and showed promising initial immune responses we do not know whether these observed responses will ultimately translate into an effective vaccine that will help protect individuals from hiv infection but hope to learn more through further testing
5694164 india is playing a significant role in global aids vaccine discovery efforts given our strong medical and scientific capabilities there is a need for continued efforts for the creation of novel reliable mechanisms for long term research on aids vaccines and other new prevention technologies
5694165 consistent innovation in science despite setbacks has ensured the development of many effective prevention technologies the successful conduct of the trial in chennai re affirms the need for continued vaccine development initiatives where learnings from every effort will contribute to global advancement of the aids vaccine field

5694167 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5694168 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5694169 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5694170 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5694220 all universities now have to take the parent factor into account on university open days you can see more parents attending than children
5694221 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go

5694231 lose on average 6 percent of their revenue to fraud every year
5694232 determining how much theft and embezzlement takes place has been the holy grail of the sector
5694233 theyre lumping all those sectors together and it could be that the for profit sector experiences a higher level of fraud while the nonprofit sector and government experience lower levels
5694234 even if the figure is 20 billion thats still a huge amount and needs to be addressed
5694235 most of these things are not caught by routine audits
5694236 theyre usually done by someone in the financial area the treasurer the bookkeeper the signer of checks who knows how to avoid getting caught
5694237 i gave a talk to a group of nonprofit executives a few weeks ago and every single one of them had a fraud story to tell
5694238 this has been going on for years but theres a feeling that it shouldnt be discussed
5694239 that they dont have a great deal of faith in the way these groups handle money
5694240 not only will that eventually give us a much better idea of how widespread fraud is with these groups it also gives them an incentive to have better financial controls
5694241 because its an extreme example of something typical that no one gets in trouble for this
5694242 theyre creating audit committees and adopting the provisions of sarbanes oxley as best practices

5694289 its not partying all the time sometimes when i get the chance i am too tired to party people dont see the work that goes in to touring but its definitely worth it

5694293 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous lover brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a c p about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5694294 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5694295 your sons are also victims of americas right wing military incursions too
5694296 politically it was just off base with the whole feeling over here at manhunt
5694297 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage
5694298 if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
5694299 when were talking about moral absolutes when were talking about morality it seems to me that what theyre emblematic of is the fact that god is the ultimate authority in law as opposed to the view that man is the ultimate authority on law
5694300 they are the supreme emblems or moral absolutes in addition moral absolutes he be lieves come from divine law the idea that god is the ultimate authority in law
5694301 our legal history in this country was based on the view there were moral absolutes
5694302 the court can find no principled basis upon which to find that or even fully consider whether the new display is constitutionally impermissible
5694303 only two views either god is the final authority and we acknowledge his unchanging standards of behavior or man is the final authority and standards of behavior change at the whim of individuals or societies

5694312 have you found yourself so wrapped up in church stuff and ministry and everything that goes along with it that those closest to you have missed out
5694313 i think a lot of the answer could be found in the difference between what we think god requires of us and what he actually does require

5694357 the internet is very much an entertainment resource for young children mainly due to how well tv broadcasters such as nickelodeon cartoon network the bbc and disney have adapted and extended their traditional offering to the web
5694358 as children hit their teenage years general entertainment sites tend to make way for games focused sites which offer a massive range of easily accessible games and ensure that teenage gaming activity extends far beyond the ps3 wii and xbox consoles
5694359 its interesting to see that the sites with the heaviest concentration of young adults split into two conflicting groups functional and entertainment this mirrors the uneasy transition of growing up from teenage years into adulthood and the associated increase in responsibility
5694360 due to changes in methodology based on historical data from the interactive advertising bureau writes marketingcharts

5694367 i do expect india to come back pretty hard at us
5694368 they have a very good side and there are a lot of talented individuals in the indian team who can single handedly change the course of a match
5694369 they will definitely come back strongly and we need to make sure we play the same brand of cricket that we played in the first match
5694370 im happy with the way we performed in the first match the bowlers hit the right areas consistently and when we batted we saw off the new ball without much damage
5694371 there is always a bit of bounce in the early overs
5694372 there is also a bit of dew for the first eight overs or so and there usually is some seam movement with the new ball
5694373 we had picked 16 players for this tournament and with sehwags return there are still 15 players
5694374 we will not be flying out a replacement for sehwag

5694396 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell i live for them
5694397 i have to keep working to support my family its not an option to stop its always difficult working away from home but i cant wait around for the doctors to find out whats wrong with me i need to keep working
5694398 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticise me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
5694399 its really hard not knowing im trying to block out thinking about it trying not to get too depressed
5694400 i have had two cancer scares before but this time they said jade there is a strong chance
5694401 after i had the miscarriage doctors warned me getting pregnant again could be a real health risk for me they have told me twice i should even have a hysterectomy but i wouldnt let them
5694402 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5694403 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5694404 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5694405 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
5694406 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
5694407 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
5694408 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
5694409 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live
5694410 rick warren will not endorse either candidate nor has he abandoned his convictions about abortion and homosexuality
5694411 for whatever good intentions pastor warren may have by posturing as a neutral broker between different points of view many of which have profound moral and religious implications he contributes to the moral ambiguity wed expect a pastor to be combating we have institutions for civic and political forums the press universities town halls etc if theyre not delivering well let the marketplace work to improve what were getting but this is not the job of pastors or churches if it is where do we go to learn about good and evil
5694412 the pretense of neutrality is really a left wing illusion its a sleight of hand to buy into relativism and somehow pastor warren seems to have fallen into the trap star is very diplomatic falling short of calling warren a leftist dh when a pastor hosts a political candidate that has a 100 percent rating by naral pro choice america and a 0 percent rating by the national right to life committee he gives legitimacy to that candidate when legitimacy is given to a line of reasoning that says that poverty and aids are symptoms of anything other than moral breakdown the relativist views of the left are justified

5694432 all universities now have to take the parent factor into account on university open days you can see more parents attending than children
5694433 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5694434 we have to remind parents that there is a professional relationship between academics and students
5694435 these parents are paying more so they think they can demand more
5694436 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
5694437 if an evangelical really believes that the bible is literal in other word s in psalm 139 god says i formed you in your mothers womb and before you were born i planned every day of your life if they believe thats literally true then they cant just walk away from that they can add other issues but they cant walk away from the belief that at conception god planned that child and to abort it would be to short circuit the purpose
5694438 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
5694439 a subsidiary of the north american islamic trust which is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia

5694454 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5694455 we are determined to deny them the russians their strategic objective
5694456 the complete withdrawal depends on the policy of saakashvili and the action of his forces
5694457 we are pressing russia to withdraw its troops at least from the heart of georgia to make it possible for talks on a durable ceasefire
5694458 the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire
5694459 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5694460 we expect an evaluation of what has happened in georgia and the ways nato can help

5694479 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5694480 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people

5694485 new services and trials are being announced almost every day judging from the response from users so far to services like m pesa and smartmoney prospects for these services are excellent both in developing and developed countries for many people it has been costly and difficult for them to transfer money via existing services even to friends and family using mobile phones solves the problem
5694486 there is a trick or two to writing a 300 page book and typesetting it in two days one is to have two people work on the book and the other is to require only one word per page and that is what miekal and and i did on june 29th and 30th in west lima wisconsin we wrote a book of 300 collaborative pwoermds certainly the longest book of pwoermds ever and to my knowledge the only collaborative pwoermds ever made the pwoermd is a queer little literary beast one that combines the art of neologism with the practice of poetry the goal of the pwoermd is to provide the experience of a poem over the course of a single poem as a poetic form it is doomed to fail frequently but ts size makes the attainment of perfection at least possible the way miekal and i created texistence worked one of us wrote fragments of two words on facing pages of a page layout on a computer and the other added letters in any way to those words and then wrote two partial words of his own occasionally i wrote a starter word of only two letters which miekal had to work hard to make into something and occasionally i wrote him a starter word so seemingly complete that he wasnt sure what he could add it was great fun we worked on this for hours at a time i usually was working on another writing project simultaneously and miekal would turn the computer towards me when it was my turn and i would turn it back to him when it was his turn
5694487 their thinking became futile and their fool ish hearts were darkened

5694506 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it

5694508 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity
5694509 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors
5694510 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
5694511 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5694512 some think that the oil is for petrobras the oil is for the union

5694531 documentary evidence shows that advantage is an example of marketing framed as science
5694532 failure to disclose the primary purpose of a trial has ethical ramifications for patients physicians and the design of clinical trials
5694533 seeding trials like advantage in which the study medication has yet to receive u s food and drug administration approval may cause patient injury for marketing purposes
5694534 because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled
5694535 all the nursing homes will choke as more and more people spend much more time disabled
5694536 but in reality that hasnt really worked out to be the case
5694537 this is very good news that i can give to some very old people
5694538 i can tell my elderly patients that their chances of being able to take care of themselves 10 years from now is the same as it is now
5694539 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
5694540 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives

5694544 people were amazing the visits the letters the fundraisers my editing job at the capitol was kept open for me until i could return which i eventually did
5694545 working at the state capitol made me realize i needed to do more
5694546 after i acquired my own disability i recognized that i was in a position to advocate for others who didnt have the same connections and advantages i had
5694547 i was a pretty stubborn guy before i broke my neck and that hasnt changed i used to joke about my stubbornness saying there was no way in hell i was going to let this thing beat me
5694548 is that even though two thirds of my body doesnt work i dont see myself as disabled and its not about denial its only when im in a situation thats inaccessible that i truly think of myself that way
5694549 we fix problems after they happen instead of investing in prevention a doctor makes money amputating a leg but loses money teaching a diabetic how to care for his leg
5694550 its not skilled nursing care its simple custodial care but i cant get out of bed in the morning without it on the other hand government programs for the very poor will pay for anything including the type of home health care that private insurance denies as a result a lot of disabled people are afraid to work and thus lose their state health benefits
5694551 but the fact is that people with disabilities are three times more likely to be poor than are members of the general population
5694552 our residential program alone loses 1 million a year in fact a quarter of our budget depends on community philanthropy
5694553 i gained this whole sense of being tied to a broader common good my work today is a reflection of that

5694572 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing its own and living off its own means
5694573 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5694574 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5694575 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5694576 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5694577 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5694578 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5694579 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5694580 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it

5694586 britains border security is now amongst the toughest in the world
5694587 the new facial recognition gates undertake checks against security watch lists in the same way as a current manual controls
5694588 the trial will tell us whether these gates can maintain the high level of entry security we have introduced into the uk
5694589 our high tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5694590 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
5694591 the british public rightly expects our borders to protect the national interests tackling immigration crime smuggling and tax fraud
5694592 we must deliver the record we know we can make
5694593 well it seems like the worlds about to implode again like it did back in the 80s
5694594 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5694595 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5694596 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
5694597 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
5694598 the benefit to the colony in having the nurture part is that it allows flexibility
5694599 they can quickly and easily change what caste theyre producing to fit their environment better but having the nature component benefits the individual because it can bias its development toward becoming reproductive its a balance between what the individual wants versus what the colony wants

5694607 ripensare a euro e al risultato raggiunto meraviglioso ma i giocatori non devono adagiarsi su quellimpresa ma penare al futuro il nostro obiettivo deve essere quello di raggiungere il vertice lho detto molte volte questo non significa che non dobbiamo tenere i piedi per terra ma che abbiamo una squadra che ha i mezzi per raggiungere questi traguardi

5694797 was die performance angeht ist klar dass wir an unsere wettbewerbsst rke von ungarn ankn pfen wollen
5694798 nach den letzten rennen sind wir jetzt ernsthaft darauf aus das drittschnellste auto zu haben valencia wird auch zeigen wie gut die teams auf neue bedingungen eingehen k nnen es wird also ein interessantes wochenende und wir haben allen grund es positiv anzugehen
5694799 mir steht noch von ungarn her ein l cheln im gesicht
5694800 das war ein unglaubliches resultat ein fantastisches gef hl ich hoffe es war der erste von vielen podiumspl tzen in der formel 1 f r mich
5694801 wichtig war dass wir gezeigt haben wie konkurrenzf hig wir im moment sind und damit den vierten platz in der konstrukteurswertung ausbauen konnten im team herrscht eine gro artige atmosph re und wir arbeiten alle hart zusammen um vorw rts zu kommen weshalb es auch eine solche genugtuung war in ungarn auf dem podest zu stehen aber valencia ist ein neues rennen und alles beginnt wieder neu
5694802 zurzeit sind wir gut in form und ich bin f r das wochenende optimistisch
5694803 bin ich viele stra enrennen gefahren und in meiner saison dort waren alle strecken neu f r mich wodurch ich gelernt habe mich schnell anzupassen die strecke sieht interessant aus und ist recht lang sodass es eine gute show werden d rfte wir haben am freitag noch viel arbeit vor uns um das auto auf die strecke abzustimmen aber zurzeit sind wir gut in form und ich bin f r das wochenende optimistisch
5694804 die strecke sieht toll aus und die lage ist fantastisch ich freue mich schon richtig auf diesen grand prix
5694805 das team hat an den vorbereitungen f r dieses rennen hart gearbeitet weil dies ja f r uns alle eine neue strecke ist aus fahrersicht ist nat rlich wichtig sie erst einmal zu befahren damit man sie allm hlich zu verstehen beginnt
5694806 mir macht es immer spa an neue austragungsorte zu gehen weil dort neue herausforderungen warten und es immer etwas zu entdecken gibt jedes rennen ist einzigartig und das finde ich gut
5694807 die strecke ist zwar neu f r uns valencia kenne ich aber schon recht gut von all den tests die wir auf dem anderen kurs hier durchgef hrt haben valencia ist eine lebendige stadt in der immer etwas los zu sein scheint und wir werden hier sicher auch viel spa haben ich erwarte f r uns ein starkes wochenende denn wir sehen zurzeit recht gut aus unser ziel ist mehr punkte zu holen aber es w re nat rlich toll wenn wir es wieder auf das podium schaffen w rden
5694808 wir erwarten dass die strecke im bereich mit mittelhohem abtrieb liegt und die bremsen ziemlich stark in anspruch nimmt der grip d rfte anfangs noch niedrig sein ber das wochenende hin dann aber besser werden
5694809 nat rlich haben wir die vorbereitungen damit begonnen uns zun chst die fia informationen anzusehen wodurch wir schon einige geschwindigkeitsprofile ausarbeiten konnten zum beispiel um den abtrieb und die anforderungen an die bremsen zu berschlagen
5694810 wir haben auch leute zum er ffnungsrennen ende juli nach valencia geschickt die uns daten zu den geschwindigkeitsprofilen fahrlinien und stra enbel gen mitbrachten

5694929 e incredibile che vi sia un aumento del ricorso a test invasivi e dolorosi e una crescita degli impianti autorizzati alla vivisezione cifre che contraddicono landamento lievemente decrescente complessivo del numero degli animali utilizzati negli ultimi dieci anni che arriva comunque alla spaventosa cifra di oltre 900mila lanno dichiara michela kuan biologa responsabile lav e autrice del dossier di denuncia disponibile su infatti per legge questo tipo di sperimentazione in deroga dovrebbe costituire leccezione e non la regola e inoltre negli ultimi anni la ricerca per lo sviluppo di metodi alternativi alla sperimentazione animale sta facendo molti passi in avanti e gli sforzi a livello internazionale stanno dando buoni frutti rendendo luso degli animali anche sotto questo aspetto una pratica sempre pi obsoleta ed ingiustificabile
5694930 in italia invece il principio per il quale il metodo alternativo debba essere preferito allimpiego di animali viene del tutto ignorato sia dallutilizzatore di animali che dal ministero della salute peraltro in nuovo ritardo sugli obblighi di pubblicazione in gazzetta ufficiale delle statistiche e dal servizio dellistituto superiore di sanit conclude michela kuan una situazione che va peraltro a tutto danno della ricerca biomedica italiana e che speriamo possa essere presto cambiata il problema non riguarda unicamente milioni di animali torturati per scopi scientifici vani ma inevitabilmente anche i milioni di malati che nella ricerca e nei farmaci ripongono speranze di cura e di vita

5694978 weve designed our solar modules specifically for the electrical utilities scale market
5694979 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near portland oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5694980 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later
5694981 the electrical market is enormous to keep up with demand the utilities are reaching out for new power production methods that are clean and safe long term these power fields are great investments that can provide a 5 year payback on the average installation and then you have 15 years of cash flow with low operating costs we see this trend picking up significantly and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity

5695032 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5695033 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary

5695107 entertainment needs are met through reality television because these shows allow people to make comparisons with media images comparisons that ultimately help them feel better about themselves and their personal circumstances
5695108 television and other media provide the thrill of observing danger without allowing people to suffer consequences
5695109 audiences know that when the curtain comes down and the lights come on in the theater everything is back to the way it is thats what reality television does for the regular viewer these shows are distracting from todays tragic events and give viewers an outlet for watching others overcome hardships escape danger live in a rainforest learn to survive under the roughest conditions and yes find love

5695125 these people were not the dirty mac brigade that you might think paedophiles may consist of
5695126 they are male in their mid 30s or early 40s who happen to have good it skills they knew what they were doing
5695127 it is therefore very important that these guys are caught and that these images are found and confiscated
5695128 without these pictures we have no way of tracking down the children to give them the kind of help and support they almost certainly will need to recover from the trauma which these pictures represent
5695129 one is that the internet itself is very difficult to police it is very difficult to find the bad guys who are doing these kind of things
5695130 equally it is about resources if you havent got the right number of policemen in the first place you have no hope of finding these guys who are doing the bad things on the internet

5695152 in a few cases both the husband and wife worked here
5695153 im over 50 so the job markets not good for me
5695154 the management did offer to let us go to other plants but thats if openings become available jcim llc just took over our plant last month and they led us to believe we still had jobs its even more of a letdown to see it close down
5695155 it might not sound like a lot but its a lot of money around here
5695156 a lot of the plastech workers have worked at that plant for 15 or 20 years

5695159 were doing business in a very challenging automotive environment and to remain competitive we have to strengthen and consolidate the business where it makes sense
5695160 jcim and blue water are two separate businesses but i think they both faced the same problem at the same time they were getting pressure to lower their prices from big accounts they had

5695213 it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5695214 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5695215 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5695216 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
5695217 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
5695218 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her
5695219 ive watched her have a mastectomy and then ive watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hyterectomy ive watched this woman survive both those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be ok no matter what
5695220 if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this
5695221 so for me one of the things that when this is all happened was that im putting together a program thats going to raise money to pay for mris for women who are at high risk
5695222 were also going to pay for the brca testing because thats very very expensive
5695223 you know i really love living and i really love my life i knew from this moment on it was only going to be good and that was going to be coming
5695224 yea im going to face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been so just knowing that in my soul gave me the strength to just say ive got to i have to get out there and and make this positive

5695282 each year homeowners in the u s use approximately 70 million pounds of pesticides to maintain the beauty of their lawn researchers continue to uncover links between pesticide exposure and serious illnesses such as cancer neurological and reproductive disorders as well as birth defects
5695283 our children and pets are especially vulnerable to the toxic chemicals we use in and out of our home they play on the floor and grass hands go unwashed paws are licked and both have extremely sensitive immune systems that can be affected pesticide granulates can be tracked into the home and make their way into carpet where they can remain for months granules spread on lawns can remain there for much longer than their warnings describe the half life of some fertilizers can be more than one year plenty of time for pets or wildlife to consume them
5695284 each year the use of lawn pesticides by homeowners accounts for most of the wildlife poisonings reported to the epa birds are serious victims because they are ground feeders and think pesticide granulates are food
5695285 each year we dump tens of millions of pounds of fertilizers and pesticides on our backyards thus poisoning birds and wildlife while creating one of the largest sources of pollution runoff in our lakes and streams

5695334 i guess youre just trying to lower the percentage of that going on our coaches work hard on what were trying to prepare and would rather not have their thoughts and ideas and game plans out there kicked around until they get to showcase them

5695345 we discovered that by going through makes smr process which begins with an interview round with the key stakeholders we were able to relate to each other in new and constructive ways that would have been difficult without an independent third party leading the conversations
5695346 although it may seem somewhat obvious or trivial on first blush
5695347 getting everyone on the same page strategically and tactically was key and im sure many cios would agree that this is not easy to do as we worked through the goals plans and realities of our organization together coupled with the deep technical analysis of our existing it applications and infrastructure that the make team provided we were able to come up with a strategic and realistic roadmap that is supported by the key stakeholders including the executive team furthermore the educational component that make has woven throughout their smr process made it all happen more easily

5695359 i just feel like im a great player and that ive always been that player and theres no limit to what more i can do im just going to keep getting better because i keep working for it i just have to keep humble and stay focused on what im doing
5695360 its one of those things where it feels good after a win calling your own plays but at the same time im not going to say it was all great and dandy there were times when we were in the huddle and its like man should i go with this one should i go with that one youve just got to go with your gut when youre out there and just play with what youre playing
5695361 for the first time this year really we complemented each other the offence and the defence
5695362 at least we have the two weeks before labour day to get over all the negativity thats surrounded us for so long and really hammer down on the find details and hopefully turn the season around while theres still an opportunity
5695363 were not where we need to be defensively offensively i thought we did some things but you cant give up two turnovers 14 points do the math on the score and we directly gave them 14 points on offence its a very frustrating night
5695364 we have some good athletes and plans we just have to figure out what we need to do better consistently we need to put points on the board we havent scored touchdowns all season you have to do that in this league
5695365 it was just awful we practise all right play hard but were not being productive its mind boggling frustrating
5695366 thats the story of the game a lot of incompletes our guys had the openings but couldnt hold on
5695367 thats huge all these games are going to add up especially as you get to the second half of the season we want to have every tie breaker possible if it comes down to that because theres so many games left and teams could turn it around and others could go downhill so we have to make sure that we go out there and keep putting up wins especially when were playing eastern opponents
5695368 its never that easy ill tell you that i think its all of us the receivers are getting open and buying into what marc als rookie head coach marc trestman and the rest of the coaching staff has brought to this team right now were practising at a high fast pace and were carrying that to the field and its working for us
5695369 i dont have any idea i know we have the best record but i dont know that were the best team i dont know that it matters right now its good to win games and thats what were trying to do
5695370 hes active he can play halfback he can play corner he makes plays hes got three interceptions that one in the end zone in b c was nothing short of spectacular
5695371 its a credit to him that we can move him around and he can be productive
5695372 well keep moving him until we can stabilize the situation and have the same defensive backfield for a few weeks so they can line up and get to know one another and get comfortable with whos to my left and whos to my right
5695373 its not too bad in practice coach has tried me in different positions so in case an injury does occur ill be used to that spot ive been playing some half some weak corner and some strong corner
5695374 you have your mind set at one position and thats what you study for you study certain receivers
5695375 then you switch positions and you have to study for that position and new receivers its tough
5695376 i think hes highly motivated i dont think he gets a lot of credit for what hes done
5695377 everybody downplays what henry does and how important he is to us
5695378 youre going to have adverse times and im pretty sure its not going to be our last interception or our last turnover this season but its the way we bounce back from those through adverse times when your offence isnt moving good or you have a turnover how do you bounce back thats how the better players are judged if i want to be one of those types of guys if i want to be a great quarterback some day ive got to make those things happen bouncing back is what the great quarterbacks have done on the teams that have won championships
5695379 i think it comes from not holding on to things
5695380 in the past i would hold on to things because i expected better out of myself but you get to a point where you say youve just got to let go
5695381 weve had a lot of guys coming in and out of our lineup weve put guys in different places receiver ken yon rambo was inside now hes outside weve got a lot of bright things but right now were not even clicking yet some plays you can tell we could run them with our eyes closed but theres others that arent as refined
5695382 thats probably the biggest thing we looked at this year to go out and take care of the ball right now eight interceptions thats too high going into this year i didnt think wed even go over 10 thats one area i definitely want us to improve on because when we do that we win games we know thats the key for us to go where we want to go
5695383 there are many technology aspects of anti phishing including those surrounding shared data resources and data exchange formats for e crime data repositories and alerting and coordination systems
5695384 as a global organization developing standards for wireless networking communications and information assurance coupled with a concern about the security of its members and the publics electronic communications it is fitting that ieee is a technical sponsor of the apwgs e crime researchers summit by our involvement we hope to open doors for those involved in the e crime research community to ieee and to the technical expertise of its members
5695385 the ecrs developed in partnership of the apwg and ieee will attract and cultivate the most advanced research in electronic crime studies enriching the research community in industry and academeand at the same time helping the ieee forge and inform standards to help protect the internet
5695386 it has been gratifying to see the researchers whove attended and presented at the ecrime conferences grow into a community of interest around this essential sub genre of the information security disciplines we have every confidence that developing the conference in collaboration with ieee will help it achieve the global scope and technical depth that the ecrs and community forming around it deserves
5695387 this collaboration makes the most of both institutions roles apwgs brief to promote understanding of electronic crime and to organize responses to it and ieees charter to foster technological innovation for the benefit of humanity we are honored beyond words to work with ieee to help to make the internet a safer place

5695390 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5695391 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5695392 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support obama for the leader of the free world

5695396 we recognized the need for this type of resource to help companies increase user acceptance and proficiency with respect to crm tools and other enterprise software applications sho guide content for microsoft dynamics crm online will help insure that users are able to use the application immediately and increase the likelihood that organizations can maximize their employees use of the software with minimal training
5695397 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
5695398 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
5695399 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
5695400 what pretense to assert as did kenneth griffin recipient last year of more than 1 billion in compensation as manager of the citadel investment group that the current income distribution has to stand if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard right far better to admit as has warren buffett that the tax rates of the wealthiest americans average nearly 15 while those of their salaried and therefore less incentivized assistants just outside their offices are nearly twice that
5695401 so the major themes of these two plans are in the case of senator mccains plan that the major emphasis is on economic efficiency cuts in marginal tax rates improves economic incentives
5695402 in the case of obamas plan the goal is primarily to improve progressivity to lower tax burdens on low income people and raise them on higher income people

5695441 the data deduplication process on clean amp match 2009 has been taken to a whole new level now more of a human level than of a computer level conventional computer software is great at exact matching it can process thousands of records per second but throw in some real world issues like not exactly matching similar records and most likely they will never be picked up clean amp match 2009 contains advanced algorithms for the detection of phonetic mis keyed and abbreviated variations within poorly structured data thus helping to identify duplications that in most instances would never be picked up with clean amp match 2009 users can quickly identify duplicate records based on a combination of fields such as contact names address information or account numbers using advanced fuzzy logic algorithms that would normally only exist in very expensive and dedicated software

5695443 with dbo2 we have the ability to tie together 45 of our business units across the nation and to track subcontractor progress in implementing turners safety program and our requirements above and beyond osha we have approximately 6000 ongoing projects at any one time and 280 full time safety professionals who have a lot of ground to cover dbo2 allows those safety professionals to really hone in on the subcontractors to create and raise awareness of our safety requirements and building l i f e living injury free everyday the instant reporting that safetynet offers enables us to make the right decisions at the field and operational levels
5695444 it felt like i hit the lottery that i was at the right place at the right time
5695445 but as i thought some more about it i believed it could truly have happened to any one of us in the course of walking our jobs and doing our best to keep each other out of harms way
5695446 over the last five years its just amazing how safetynet has caught on i know that the project executives meet on a regular basis to discuss observations whos making them and which jobs are doing better than others this information that we collect is something thats carried all the way up to the top and trickles back down
5695447 the five million observation milestone signifies engagement in the dbo2 safetynet system by everyone in our company
5695448 next we will focus on what people do with those nuggets of insight in order to continue to raise the bar on safety and loss prevention not only for turner but the industry as a whole were on the right track with improving the use of the system and extracting meaningful data that we can use for positive change
5695449 our entire team salutes turners commitment to using leading indicators to drive improved organizational financial and safety performance the dramatic and sustained positive results that turner has derived from using both leading and lagging indicators provides a glimpse at the new standard for risk and safety management

5695453 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5695454 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5695455 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5695456 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5695457 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5695458 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5695459 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5695460 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5695461 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5695472 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5695473 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5695474 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5695475 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5695476 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5695477 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5695478 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5695479 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5695488 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the
5695489 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5695490 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5695491 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5695492 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5695493 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5695494 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5695495 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5695496 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5695497 they told me there are going to be resources here
5695498 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5695499 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5695500 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5695501 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5695502 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5695503 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5695504 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5695505 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5695506 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both

5695510 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5695511 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5695512 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5695513 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5695514 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5695515 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5695516 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5695517 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5695518 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5695519 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5695520 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5695521 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5695522 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5695523 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5695524 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5695525 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5695526 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5695527 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5695528 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5695529 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5695530 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5695531 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5695532 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5695533 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5695534 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5695535 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5695536 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5695537 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5695538 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5695539 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5695540 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5695541 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5695542 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5695543 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5695544 this movement is just like when you are using a sword it confuses your opponent
5695545 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5695546 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5695547 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5695548 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5695549 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5695550 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5695551 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5695552 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5695553 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5695554 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5695555 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5695556 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5695557 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5695558 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5695559 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5695560 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5695561 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5695562 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5695563 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5695564 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5695565 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5695566 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5695567 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5695568 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5695569 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5695570 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5695571 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5695572 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5695573 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5695574 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5695575 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5695576 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5695577 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5695578 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5695579 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5695580 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5695581 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5695582 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5695583 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5695584 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

5695587 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5695588 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5695589 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5695590 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5695591 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5695592 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5695593 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5695594 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5695595 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5695596 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5695597 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5695598 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5695599 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5695600 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5695601 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5695602 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5695603 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5695604 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5695605 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5695606 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5695607 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5695608 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5695609 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5695610 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5695611 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5695612 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5695613 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5695614 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5695615 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5695616 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director

5695618 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5695619 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5695620 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5695621 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5695622 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5695623 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5695624 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5695625 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5695626 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5695627 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5695628 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5695629 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5695630 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5695631 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5695632 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5695633 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5695634 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5695635 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5695636 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5695637 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5695638 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5695639 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5695640 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5695641 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5695642 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5695643 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5695644 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5695645 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5695646 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5695647 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5695648 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5695649 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5695650 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5695651 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice

5695655 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5695656 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5695657 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5695658 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5695659 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5695660 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere

5695662 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5695663 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5695664 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5695665 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5695666 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5695667 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5695668 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5695669 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5695670 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

5695820 people have looked at electric cars for a long time as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other toxic emissions from cars and generally speaking they just havent sold well and they have been viewed as underpowered short range vehicles
5695821 with the engineering jb has led at tesla the company has really changed the way people view electric cars

5695860 the problem today is his foot its not clear exactly when it began but it is six or seven years old it was there before the 2004 athens games and it has been coming and going
5695861 its the end of the achilles tendon in his right foot im afraid he wont be able to compete before the end of the year he can barely walk he was in tears hes very depressed
5695862 until last saturday he was in good shape we did all we could i think all the chinese people will understand this situation and will encourage him to come back to the track
5695863 this morning he felt the pain intensify even though he felt the pain he decided to compete in the first heat

5695880 i have no idea what seafair is supposed to be about
5695881 i have no idea what seafair is supposed to be about
5695882 i have no idea what seafair is supposed to be about
5695883 i credit much of my success to dan colchico who played so aggressively against me on each and every down during practice that by the time i played against my opponent on sunday i felt like i had gotten a break
5695884 the quarterback rotation will be the same for chicago on thursday we have a short week to prepare and i want to keep the team focused on the bears
5695885 the starters will most likely play the first half with the second unit coming in during the third quarter
5695886 were just at that point where we are getting closer to the regular season so you want to start easing into a normal work week
5695887 plus its a short week with a game on thursday already
5695888 once the season starts and we are installing they throw the whole book at us so this is good practice and will give guys a better idea of the way coach martz does things
5695889 its great to get more opportunities to get timing down with the quarterbacks whether its j t alex or shaun
5695890 i love being out there ive been prepping myself for this opportunity i did hurt my groin in the first game but i was able to bounce back and i felt fresh last week in the game and im trying to make the most of my playing time
5695891 i think those kind of plays are plays that i can do when im healthy
5695892 this is a fast league and so its difficult to make those plays when you are a wounded duck it was good to be healthy and in that situation where i could make a play and hopefully i can make some more
5695893 it evens out the playing field a little bit because offenses cant check with you as much when there was no headset we had to corral guys on the sideline then we had to relay to guys standing in the huddle what the call was now i can say it immediately and guys can start moving out it helps us with everything adjustments its easier for us to get the calls in and its easier for us to make substitutions as well
5695894 thats something i hope we see a lot of all season long
5695895 i think one of these days im going to go get a hair cut
5695896 they needed extra time to make tights for you big guys
5695897 we are basically double teaming the nose tackle to the mike linebacker
5695898 we use it when the linebacker is not a fast flow player so we can try to double the nose and get him off the line
5695899 youve got to be square if they turn their shoulders at all theyll never be able to adjust to the linebacker
5695900 sight is also important they can never lose sight of the backer or what is coming at them
5695901 if the d linemen i start off working on runs away from me hes no longer a threat to me
5695902 what is a threat at that point is usually going to be the defensive end
5695903 you might have your hands on that nose but you want to have your eyes trained on what is coming from the other direction
5695904 so youve got to have good peripheral vision and spatial awareness
5695905 we can get huge plays on those cutback runs if we block it right
5695906 every defensive uses a different scheme and its just a matter of us being prepared and knowing what to do when we get into a game
5695907 hopefully he gets better quick but at the same time ive got to do my thing i will go in there when needed and i expect myself to be ready
5695908 its just a necessary evil its something youve got to do but this camp really has been a lot better for me than in past years staying at a hotel is better the weather out here is great the hotel is just a few minutes away so i get some ice on my knees and then get some rest ive also really been able to get a lot of good work done in this offense and learning it inside out
5695909 people adore this blog for its snarky insightful commentary and reporting
5695910 quick jonas jennings update jonas broke his hand he should be out of surgery here shortly hell miss this weeks game but he should be back after that its not bad enough to keep him out of anything further so that is the good and the bad news of it the quarterback rotation will remain the same for the game weve got a very short week i dont want to mess with things right now i think it is best that we keep our focus on the bears it is important for a lot of guys to play well in this game and thats what well do this week playing time will typically be first half with the first group that goes out there and then the second half in the third quarter we will work the twos in and finish up with the threes if you saw kyle wright not practicing hes got a knee bothering him hes got some knee swelling but other than that he should be alright guys who look to be out for the game at this point are lewis baker the defensive back michael robinson david bass and the three wide receivers ashley lelie bryant johnson and arnaz battle other than that its been jonas who i already mentioned other than that it should be okay well wait and see about tarell brown who went light on today in practice everybody else should be good to go
5695911 well this time like i said this largely has to do with the short week i dont want to throw anything off i want to just keep going down that path we seem to be making progress with our entire offense so i want to keep that going that is extremely important to me so thats what we are doing
5695912 it can be but all of them have been important to us this year and even the last one will be somewhat important so well see what goes on in the san diego game as well we will probably do a little bit more in the san diego game than has been our history i guess you could say
5695913 just keep playing well hes doing a good job all three of the guys are doing well some are getting more reps than others but ive been pleased with all three of them i do feel confident we have three guys who can win games two of them i know can because ive played with them in the past and continue to take a look at j t
5695914 more than customary not the whole game or something usually it is a one series deal for some teams but we might do a little more well take it one game at a time and some of that will depend on what we do with this one
5695915 thats a good question i hope to get all three receivers back by the san diego game as well as michael robinson possibly even david baas all the guys that are out this week that i mentioned i would expect to at least be available for that game so we will wait and see until that guy gets on the field it is hard to really evaluate them bryant did a great job in the otas and in the minicamp he did a nice job in training camp when he first came out ever since the raider practice when he pulled his hamstring obviously i havent seen it all
5695916 very much so without question it goes without saying its a great example as ive said of a guy who had an opportunity because of the injuries around him to show what he can do to showcase and work with the first unit as he did as weve already seen in two games hes done a very nice job i believe hes going to help us
5695917 as close as next week possibly that might just mean hes on the field practicing but that doesnt mean we will play him necessarily in the game
5695918 he will have something on there weve talked about it ill be curious to see what it looks like because i certainly have some opinions on what it is sometimes with an offensive lineman it is very restrictive if he cant use that hand very much ive been led to believe that what will be on there will be functional
5695919 enough to know takeo is a good football player i enjoy watching him out there he does a great job interacting with our guys as you can see hes still out there waiting with mike singletary but hes coming off the field with him hes been a real pro ive been very impressed with him the more of those kind of guys you can get on your roster the better hes not done at all physically hes still good in that respect hes just getting comfortable with when he hears the call like i said before kind of relating it to what he knows
5695920 i wouldnt say very confident but i feel better because the first week the group did well also against the raiders and then last week the group did pretty good i think we made some progress but it is training camp and preseason game so well keep working on it is what im saying i guess
5695921 hes matured quite a bit thats the biggest thing what you see i see also certainly not making it up what you saw was good
5695922 well his performance basically i dont know what else it would be you know the fact that hes making plays knowing his job knowing his assignments hes working well with justin smith on several things that they do together along with the other guys
5695923 i feel good about the rotation right now and i dont want to mix it up on the short week we only have three days after today obviously hell play the game it is a short week and weve got eleven guys we want to look at too
5695924 its certainly given me no reason to take him out of there right now
5695925 j t osullivan will start yes the same rotation that weve gone with the last two weeks
5695926 id say that its a short week and were staying consistent with our plan
5695927 well they go to meetings there in the meetings and get schooled everyday on what were doing
5695928 theyve all gotten in a good amount of work if something happens somebody gets sick gets a little flu bug or something well be fine im very confident in all three guys i like all three
5695929 move him to another position one of the mistakes that people make sometimes is on position moves is that they think that because of athleticism that they can go do something were playing football its not a track meet its a game of football and if i line up one place how i see things compared to another is entirely different its like saying a good running back thats your best player should be your quarterback well as we all know thats really not the case all positions are different so if you do move somebody as you asked in the secondary you have to be sure that they have an awareness that they can play that other position its like being a center fielder opposed to a right fielder im not a big time baseball player but i think theres got to be some difference not just speed alone and its kind of the same thing
5695930 i have good hopes for reggie smith hes going to be a good football player it would benefit us and benefit himself if he can continue to hone in on his corner skills and get good at that because in time as we learn about him he might be able to move to safety but for right now he has the ability he just needs to get the consistency to play corner
5695931 obviously our pro personnel department felt he did then theres a lot of people that we talked to that have coached him before that felt the same way and after that it was just a matter of bringing him in and seeing some guys you bring in obviously you see that they may not be as good as you thought but they still give you something and allen rossum has done a nice job obviously the touchdown the other day got everybodys eye but he does a nice job in practice too he does good
5695932 not to take anything away from michael lewis last year because he did a good job too but just play making ability he has the ability to take it back and score with it like he did the other day if nothing else as we tell all of our return guys if they can just get a first down with the punt return that helps us in other words if they get ten or more yards on the return weve already got one first down thats kind of our goal every time when he returns a punt and hopefully hes the guy that gives us at least that
5695933 oh yeah and he knows his job hes done it a long time he knows the importance of securing the ball and doing something with it hes played that long he knows it

5695941 a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5695942 because the truly autistic child needs as much help as he or she can get the truly autistic child needs the funding
5695943 it is the falsely diagnosed the misdiagnosed and the outright fakers who want the benefits who must be found out and must be turned out so that the money can go to the truly needy in this particular field
5695944 why would i have chosen to attack defenseless children when ive never done so in my entire life
5695945 think about that what would i have gained by doing it nothing i didnt do it the fact of the matter is the enemies of the truth did it using you the parents of the injured child to turn on me the defender of the child
5695946 for the truly mentally ill kids i feel awful i was one and i managed to survive
5695947 i have known michael savage for nine years now over those nine years we have had occasion to disagree on many issues however i have always respected michael as a man of conviction and i have noticed throughout our relationship that he has always been passionate and intense in his opposition to persons who he perceived to be disrespectful of persons dealing with special challenges i once asked him about his passion in this area and he noted that it was because he had a brother who was disabled but that he did not want to discuss it michael never shared any particulars on this with me until he shared with his audience on monday that his brother never spoke during his lifetime was institutionalized at 5 or 6 years old and died in that institution in his 20s my observations of michaels consistent opposition to what he viewed as abuse or disrespect of person dealing with special challenges and of his interest in children as well as his 1982 book healing children naturally are completely inconsistent with michael attacking children who are truly autistic in contrast his belief that misdiagnosing children with autism will damage those children who are misdiagnosed and stigmatize them for life his aversion to what he sees as improper medication of young children and subjecting them to a lifetime of chemical straight jackets and his recent sharing of his belief that the medical profession failed to properly care for his brother prior to his brothers death do explain his passion in challenging what he sees as improper efforts by some in the health care industry to brand and treat as autistic persons who are not
5695948 not just scoring it but to get a chance to make the team was pretty special
5695949 it all kind of happened so fast the next thing you knew we were wearing the gold medal
5695950 he can skate he is a workaholic just non stop the thing i like about him is hes got skill to go with that work ethic he can make plays he can shoot the puck
5695951 i think the whole year and experience he had gives him confidence
5695952 he was a first team ohl all star he had a spectacular year a spectacular playoff im sure making the world junior team was a boost and doing so well and scoring that goal certainly was a boost but the body of his year is more impressive than a goal he scored even if it happens to be a hallmark goal for the canadian junior program
5695953 i knew that when the draft came up i wouldnt be picked so it wasnt really a big deal
5695954 when it happens it motivates you more to have a great season the next year i got traded during the summer to get a fresh start and it worked out
5695955 the good thing was a lot of my buddies went through it the year before so it was easy to talk to them about the draft
5695956 im working in the summer to do everything i can to make that happen
5695957 i asked them straight up you guys are picking fifth so what is your incentive to fly me down
5695958 like any other team they didnt know what they were doing with the pick they didnt know if they were going to trade down and sure enough they did and i was happy
5695959 its not up to them to pick me its up to me to go perform if i do that i have a chance
5695960 it did show some guts but i really think it was just him trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together
5695961 it got him thinking maybe theyll trade down or pick me at five it gave him a chance to prove to us what type of kid he is and he certainly did that
5695962 they were hoping to get a fifth pick being a fan of hockey myself if my team did that i would probably be upset too but thats not realizing why they did it
5695963 everywhere i have played i have always gotten along with the fans id like to keep it that way fans are a huge part of the game if you dont have fans you dont have anything i want to be a fan favorite and ill do what i can to become that
5695964 he has top six talent and now its just about what he wants to do with it
5695965 hes going to put points on the board and pucks in the net but hell do the little things that will get him on the ice in many situations
5695966 im on the board and its up to me its not up to them to pick me its up to me to go perform if i do that i have a chance
5695967 if he comes to training camp and proves he belongs on the then hell get a serious look he also has an awesome opportunity back in windsor where they will have a memorial cup contending team from the development standpoint were going to be very patient if he deserves to be there then hell have that opportunity if hes not quite ready hell go to windsor and that will help his development
5695968 thats not to put pressure on josh but he cant come in with that mentality
5695969 if he comes in knowing that hes going to go back to windsor thats not going to help him
5695970 they knew i wasnt going to go fifth overall and it wasnt that they were being hush hush about something
5695971 i just asked them straight up i didnt see a big deal about it
5695972 we had 28 or 29 guys at conditioning camp better than last year
5695973 there was a lot more depth a lot better than last year it forces these guys if they have a realistic approach to think gee i have to work hard because there are guys coming and guys going by me its an internal push they get from each other
5695974 i give him a lot of credit for coming over here and making that decision to play in the ahl alexander nikulin did the same thing we have a philosophy that well give them a contract if they come over and play here we dont know how far from the nhl they are unless they play here in north america
5695975 speed and strength are issues with him and hes not the most confident kid in the world
5695976 he had a very good season in seattle well he had a good start then hit a wall in midseason because there were a lot more games and a lot of travel he adjusted and had a good playoffs i talked to his general manager in seattle russ farwell and were thinking it will all come together with another big year
5695977 hes a young russian kid who we put pressure on to come over later than we did with ilya zubov
5695978 zubovs success helped nikulins decision alexander played two nhl games for us last year and looked decent he had 14 goals and 50 points in binghamton playing on the second and third lines he had an outstanding rookie year the main thing nikulin has to work on is that some nights hes good and some nights hes not he has to improve his consistency he needs to understand that he cant just rely on his skill all the time hell get it hes a very talented kid
5695979 josh is at the point coming out of our entry level contract where he has to make a real push to be a true depth player
5695980 it cant be for one or two games when we have an injury we have to be able to trust him to play 10 15 games effectively he is 23 and a fourth year pro and he can be a top end ahl player he has talent and hockey sense but is not a top skilled player he has to make himself more of a two way center
5695981 i went to the world championships in quebec to see him play and i liked what i saw
5695982 i knew i was going to like it hes had a couple of years in the swedish elite league i think thats the best league outside of north america i dont think they compete as hard in the russian league peter is a great kid an extremely intelligent player if anything he is too responsible defensively he really understands the centers responsibilities
5695983 its good that he came over here because there is nothing hockey wise that will hold him back he has to learn conditioning and nutrition the whole thing that kids have to learn the kids who play canadian juniors are ahead on that score his only issue is conditioning
5695984 he stepped right into the ahl with both feet on the ground he was very poised and showed veteran qualities that you dont expect in a young guy out of college he contributed right off the bat he moved the puck very well and he sees the ice well right from the start he was playing an intelligent game
5695985 what can you say other than to give the scouts here credit
5695986 telling business leaders that obama has changed his position on some key questions of nasa funding in recent months and should not be trusted to support the program

5695988 we thought it was an expensive holiday to start with but then of course with everything going up so much over the last 12 months we found it more and more difficult to rake the money together we were going to have to dip into savings to meet the cost so the extra 900 was just a bitter blow
5695989 i was quite shocked when i came up with how close the whole thing is to below 10 i have to say that when you look at everything they have not broken any rules but it makes it look contrived
5695990 we are not in any way profiteering from our customers rather the opposite
5695991 the incredible and anticipated increase in fuel costs has caused us much heartache and worry
5695992 we had to think hard about the investment but we strongly believed it was the right thing to do to have an electricity bill of only 9 in 21 months with the current climate of increasing energy costs i think it was the right thing to do
5695993 we did it initially knowing that energy prices were on the increase but i dont anybody expected them to go up as aggressively as they have
5695994 it hasnt really moved any of my purchases away from the high street sometimes i really kick myself if i forget to use quidco and then realise i could have made cash back
5695995 we went live with 500 retailers and we didnt know have a clue how well it was going to be received literally within the first day we had hundreds of members join the site and giving us really positive feedback that they valued the savings we were offering
5695996 its a very simple way of taking a lot of treatment out of hospitals and allowing people to take charge of monitoring their own diseases
5695997 then with our second generation materials itll be heart tissue bladder tissue were trying to regenerate the tissues so that they are more like those of a younger person
5695998 we still have a problem in the uk in that there is a very big early stage funding gap
5695999 if i look at investors in the sector we work in i can count them on one hand
5696000 ive learned that technology is not everything its technology plus the package that goes round it
5696001 also knowing that money is not expensive but time is expensive we really need to hit the deadlines
5696002 its been used to power satellites up in space but its expensive
5696003 the reason we can use it on earth as that people are developing simple mirrors and plastic lenses to concentrate the light
5696004 the key lesson is to connect with customers as soon as you possibly can
5696005 there is a catalogue of errors in technology start ups where you produce something because you can then you find that theres no market for it
5696006 we want to make a difference to the environment to at least help to stop global warming
5696007 ive got four kids they ask me what im doing to stop global warming
5696008 now i can give a much better answer than saying im going off to teach i can say im going off to build machines to help reduce co2
5696009 i believe theyve been sitting on it and basically its whilst theyve been sitting on it that its dropped
5696010 whether its down to the drop in interest rates and the stockmarket they should still have paid me at the date that i asked surely
5696011 if someone has actually incurred delay and in consequence of that delay has suffered financial loss because their pension pot has dropped from the date when they should have got it to the date they actually are going to get it then they will have certainly a claim for compensation on the grounds of financial loss
5696012 everybody who has suffered a loss and that has been brought to our attention obviously were investigating these proactively as well will be compensated
5696013 most of the dead were young men aged between 18 and 20 they were in line waiting to enter the school for recruiting exams when they were mowed down by the blast
5696014 the car explosion destroyed part of the outer wall of the school and blew a huge crater into the ground about three meters yards from the main gate
5696015 we have to worry about the security situation now we should not play down the terrorist menace as the authorities are doing
5696016 tuesdays attack showed that they the rebels are well entrenched on the ground and seem to be able to hit significant targets

5696021 i bought a bed early january and paid with my citibank visa debit card the total amount came to 1 030 we were supposed to have it delivered on 4th april but on the 1st of april i was told by the store manager that the company has gone into bankruptcy and they will not be making any more deliveries
5696022 banks make every effort to keep their staff informed but unfortunately sometimes people get things wrong
5696023 this is a seysmic scam which leaves a trail of misery despair tears and sadly in the one case that has been brought to our attention a suicide
5696024 its a very sinking feeling youve all this money thats taken you a long time to earn its like having your house broken into and theyve taken everything youve worked for
5696025 where these scams are coming out of the european union countries we want the european commission and those member states to have more pressure put on them to implement eu legislation to close down these entities
5696026 it is critically important for the public to ensure that any relationship they enter into in relation to their investments is done through a uk regulated body
5696027 if ever the investments went wrong any chance of compensation only really arises when that firm is regulated by the uk regulator
5696028 the average shop if youre a decent shop youre writing a million a week
5696029 ive just been stuck for forty odd thousand other people could be stuck for a lot more

5696031 what these guys will do is just rip them apart
5696032 you might take them for ten grand then four weeks later a loaders just got half a million off them very easily

5696038 there are absolutely silly amounts of money last year i took over a hundred thousand cash
5696039 theres nothing i could say that would apologise what we do is not nice
5696040 the people who do this were materialistic theres too much money people arent going to just stop doing it
5696041 the beast is too big you cannot cut the head off something like that
5696042 so hsbcs decision to increase the cash withdrawal fee for card use abroad perhaps isnt necessarily a surprise obviously it will impact the consumer with millions of us travelling overseas in the coming weeks people could well be caught out by this fee

5696044 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5696045 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5696046 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5696047 he didnt have any clout and he didnt try to use it

5696069 the use of force is not a basis to redraw the map of countries around russia
5696070 neutral peacekeeping force in georgia because russia is clearly party to this conflict
5696071 russian peacekeepers have engaged in wanton destruction and this has isolated russia the us has not isolated russia
5696072 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5696073 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of russian president dmitry medvedev to abide by the peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5696074 it is now in the hands of russia to take action russia should adhere to the six point plan and russians should go back to their positions on august 6th
5696075 i should add we will certainly not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia the future will depend on concrete actions on the russian side
5696076 which can be seen as the same kind of consultation mechanism we have with our other partner ukraine
5696077 georgia is a sovereign country with a democratically elected government at the moment that principle is not accepted by some
5696078 there was very strong language around the table of the need for russia to honour the ceasefire commitment that its president has undertaken
5696079 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces from georgia back to the august 6th 7th status quo ante
5696080 this is a great opportunity for us to give our players the chance to witness one of the biggest bingo events today

5696082 for patients presenting with chest pain rapid diagnosis and the initiation of treatment can mean the difference between life and death
5696083 ask yourself this question would i rather wait more than an hour to find out if i was having a heart attack or would i want to know in 15 minutes the answer 100 percent of the time would be the sooner the better for my heart my health my life for these reasons the study findings are very significant
5696084 the i stat results got to the doctor an average of 45 minutes faster than the lab results and thats a lot of time when heart muscle is dying
5696085 this is why i stat patient side point of care testing demonstrated a trend toward reducing length of stay in the ed for both admitted and discharged patients
5696086 i want to emphasize that this is all part of a campaign to distract the attention of the american people from the real energy crisis which is facing us by talking endlessly about drilling for oil in tiny protected areas of our country when senator mccain knows that we will not see a drop of oil from offshore drilling for eight to ten years
5696087 senator mccain by his trip tomorrow will hope that we forget that he opposes immediate relief for consumers like senator barack obamas one thousand dollar energy credit which is going to be paid for by a windfall profits tax on oil companies and senator mccain hopes that we wont notice that it was the bush cheney mccain energy policy of the last several years that has increased gas prices from 1 89 when bill clinton left office to over four dollars today
5696088 and instead of looking ahead to real and to new solutions senator mccain is looking back once again to fellow washington insiders like the 33 former oil and gas lobbyists who are advising him and fundraising for his campaign and he simply wants to continue the policies of president bush over the last seven and a half years which have failed miserably to help us begin to become energy independent and to begin to reduce the price of oil and the price of gasoline for consumers
5696089 so the american people i hope will begin to understand this as just a gimmick as they understood that the federal gas tax holiday was a gimmick senator mccain is not going to solve our energy crisis because frankly he helped create it
5696090 weve been wanting to try a reverse auction for some time as we believed the process could significantly benefit the city and ultimately our taxpayers
5696091 i cant say enough about how great world energys people were throughout the process the market directors were extremely knowledgeable about the industry and helped us make key decisions regarding structuring the auctions to ensure we had significant supplier participation we were particularly pleased that world energy was able to drum up supplier interest for the auction even though we used our own paper for awarding the contract
5696092 world energy is clearly a market leader in state and local government energy procurement
5696093 were pleased to welcome the city of waco to our family of local government customers among them monmouth county nj and the cities of new britain ct worcester ma temple tx and recently springfield ma who saved over 500 000 per year on the recent electricity auction we conducted for them in june

5696097 i look forward to collaborating with my colleagues at swiss re and working with government and the private sector to develop solutions that are at the forefront of insurance and the broader financial issues we face today
5696098 the bush administration has found itself battling a familiar charge that its response to a major crisis was slow and uncertain
5696099 hesitance to roundly and immediately condemn russias aug 8 invasion stood in contrast to the response of the two major presidential candidates some observers said mr bush was unassertive when he needed to be bold
5696100 it had to mark some sort of watershed last week when bushs press office sent out its latest e mail complaint this time directed at that leftist bastion the wall street journals editorial page
5696101 sharp response underscored a growing public relations problem facing president bush during his last months in office a lot of conservatives are increasingly unhappy with him particularly when it comes to foreign affairs for a president already burdened with approval ratings well below 30 percent this is not welcome news
5696102 as with many foreign policy issues this one highlighted a continuing fight within the administration
5696103 secretary rice national security adviser stephen j hadley and under secretary of state william j burns
5696104 in the last week two major pillars of bushs approach to foreign policy spreading democracy and improving relations with russia have crumbled jeopardizing eight years of work and sending the administration scrambling for new strategies in the waning months of its term
5696105 declaring that russias actions have seriously strained relations with the west and again accusing the kremlin of reverting to a cold war stance
5696106 said sunday she would travel to poland in coming days to ink a deal on installing us interceptor missiles on polish territory im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting she told fox news sunday
5696107 foreign ministers of the 26 nato members are due to meet in brussels on tuesday to discuss the crisis in georgia after a five day war between tbilisi and moscow over the pro moscow region of south ossetia
5696108 assured georgia would join nato as she strongly backed the ex soviet republics president mikheil saakashvili in his conflict with russia
5696109 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5696110 it was one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgias nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia
5696111 is strongly in favour of georgia joining nato but misgivings from france and germany prevented tbilisi being awarded full candidate status in bucharest
5696112 a white house spokesman gordon johndroe said nato countries are likely to put georgia and ukraine on the track to becoming members of the western military alliance at a meeting of foreign ministers in december
5696113 as senior us officials again warned of serious consequences if they fail to comply
5696114 russian forces were on the move in georgia but there is no clear indication they are heading for the border
5696115 medvedevs pledge was immediately greeted with skepticism by us and georgian officials who have accused russia of pushing deeper into georgian territory despite signing a ceasefire pact
5696116 been moving launchers for short range ballistic missiles into south ossetia a step that appeared intended to tighten its hold on the breakaway territory
5696117 the streets of this occupied city reflected a broadening not a waning of russias military incursion
5696118 the feedback and demand from thousands of health and wellness retailers has been tremendous because there are no other multivitamin products like this on the market
5696119 both retailers and consumers are demanding products that go beyond organic so we believe we have hit the mark with the raw vitamins minerals and co factors in the vitamin code formulas we are extremely excited to bring this important new product to market because we feel that raw nutrients and supplementation is the next big thing for the natural products industry
5696120 were excited about this breakthrough development because most consumers have no idea what theyre getting when they purchase a bottle of 200 vitamins for ten dollars in the grocery store
5696121 people may think they are getting a bargain but the vast array of nutrients and co factors that are found in food and missing from synthetic highly processed vitamins could be important for their personal health the vitamin code delivers nutrients in a form that nature provides and that the body thrives upon

5696129 the most important thing caregivers can do is to educate themselves on their responsibilities once theyve taken on this role
5696130 its not easy and can be further complicated by the emotional involvement the caregiver often has with the person theyre caring for be it a spouse parent other close relative or friend
5696131 its also important however that caregivers recognize they are not alone and that they seek help when they need it
5696132 inevitably when you begin talking about someones healthcare financial matters come into play so you want to designate someone you can trust who will be able to look at the whole picture
5696133 as a caregiver with power of attorney you are acting on another persons behalf
5696134 you want to make sure that you have a very clear understanding of what the individual you are caring for wants and that you truly are committed to acting in their best interest
5696135 just as you do with your own financial records as a caregiver you want to set up a system so that you can keep track of all the important documents of the individual for whom you are caring remember you really are stepping into their shoes you are responsible for making sure you know where things are and what needs to be done when
5696136 many working adults dont set up monthly budgets so long as the money coming in is far more than the money going out or needed for savings this lack of planning can work
5696137 but when youre dealing with an individual that has a disability that is likely increasing their healthcare costs and keeping them from ever returning to full time work good planning is essential
5696138 two thirds of ssdi applications are rejected and the average time it now takes from initial application through appeals to get an award is two to four years given all the responsibilities a caregiver has getting help from a representative reduces the burden substantially
5696139 while these plans can be costly they can be an essential financial planning component for individuals unable to get any other insurance and facing mounting healthcare costs while awaiting medicare eligibility
5696140 not all medicare plans are created equal and people often opt for the traditional plan thinking its the safe choice but for people with disabilities medicare advantage plans often are the optimal choice you cant be turned away for coverage due to a pre existing condition they usually cost less than a traditional medicare and supplemental plan combined and most medicare advantage plans include prescription drug coverage

5696146 the growing power and influence of emerging market economies in the global marketplace which is reinforced by the findings of this study has never been more evident as developed economies now firmly rely on their investment resources and trade
5696147 within the last several years weve seen a broad cross section of emerging market companies looking to become global players and gaining a foothold in developed economies is clearly a key part of their growth strategies

5696153 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5696154 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5696155 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5696156 however the eu claims it can now charge duties on these products simply because they incorporate technologies or features that did not exist when the ita was concluded

5696245 they were both really strong about the military they both did sports they both made people laugh and they were the people you wanted to be around everyone wanted to be around either one of them because they were lighthearted fun people
5696246 it isnt fair to lose two great people like that in the same week

5696250 as far as back as i can remember he was talking about joining the marines
5696251 i dont think it was something he would ever regret he loved this country
5696252 he told me he saw me as a younger sister and i looked up to him
5696253 i always asked him how the situation was over there and was it dangerous and he said things were fine and the locals were pretty nice

5696297 it looks like they searched the entire store and they could not find the turtle
5696298 i guess this qualifies as a missing turtle report but i dont think were out there looking for it
5696299 in the wild they would have zero chance in captivity most die within a few days of birth
5696300 they were trying the best they could but the turtle was just starting to waste away it wasnt feeding properly

5696322 many organizations recognize the need for chargeback as they virtualize their infrastructures but they simply do not know where to start the challenge is that in the new virtual data center where all hardware is shared it needs to develop new ways to report on and account for the usage of shared resources cpu memory storage network etc
5696323 without cost visibility it is impossible to put in place the financial controls necessary to implement virtualization effectively the goal of this workshop is to walk attendees through a step by step approach for implementing chargeback and gaining cost visibility in as little as a day

5696325 i do expect india to come back pretty hard at us
5696326 they have a very good side and there are a lot of talented individuals in the indian team who can single handedly change the course of a match
5696327 they will definitely come back strongly and we need to make sure we play the same brand of cricket that we played in the first match
5696328 im happy with the way we performed in the first match the bowlers hit the right areas consistently and when we batted we saw off the new ball without much damage
5696329 there is always a bit of bounce in the early overs
5696330 there is also a bit of dew for the first eight overs or so and there usually is some seam movement with the new ball
5696331 we had picked 16 players for this tournament and with sehwags return there are still 15 players
5696332 we will not be flying out a replacement for sehwag
5696333 in the first match we were always chasing the game after we lost early wickets
5696334 thats always the case when you lose too many wickets at start in an odi game
5696335 by the time you pick his delivery it is too late to play a big shot
5696336 this change will definitely help pac ensure that we use communications in the most effective way possible
5696337 work towards the best unified promotional strategy that will the profile and reputation of uwindsor for years to come

5696341 we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team

5696347 ive had great backing and im happy with the money ive had to spend the owner cant just keep pumping millions and millions of pounds in

5696355 team wonderbike is promoting bikes as tools for positive social change
5696356 so i make choices that allow me to avoid all that such as finding housing about five miles from work my current commute is part walking and part light rail on nice days ill walk the whole way
5696357 we estimate that the shuttle program reduced nearly 3 million miles of vehicle travel and saved just under 50 000 gallons of fuel last year
5696358 i dont think being green has to be an all or nothing proposition
5696359 do what you can if that means simply checking your tire pressure regularly or not idling your car thats a good start
5696360 entertainment needs are met through reality television because these shows allow people to make comparisons with media images comparisons that ultimately help them feel better about themselves and their personal circumstances
5696361 television and other media provide the thrill of observing danger without allowing people to suffer consequences
5696362 audiences know that when the curtain comes down and the lights come on in the theater everything is back to the way it is thats what reality television does for the regular viewer these shows are distracting from todays tragic events and give viewers an outlet for watching others overcome hardships escape danger live in a rainforest learn to survive under the roughest conditions and yes find love

5696369 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing its own and living off its own means
5696370 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5696371 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5696372 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5696373 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5696374 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5696375 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5696376 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5696377 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it
5696378 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down

5696446 those expenditures are worthwhile but they were not what the lottery was intended for and were now seeing that organisations like sport england are having cuts in their budgets if that were to be a continuing position it would severely damage the future facilities that could be made available

5696465 we create this list each year as a reminder of the rapidly changing frame of reference for each new generation entering college the mindset of these students is quite different than the faculty who are about to prepare them to become the leaders of tomorrow
5696466 as the list changes each year so does our means of distributing it were pleased that this year represents our first webcast using mediasite
5696467 the list is terrific for a chuckle terrific if you have a mildly masochistic need to feel old and its terrific in giving you a snapshot of whats happened in the last 18 years
5696468 its also a nice snapshot of the attitudes and events of entering college students
5696469 what exactly is it that you want me to do wait a minute before that what exactly is it that happened you havent even told me who l was and i really only met her that one time at mcdonalds you havent told me why you think she was kidnapped or what you want to do about it or anything youre just assuming ill be ready to help and im sure id like to help but i have school you know i can hardly go around renting out hotel rooms and chasing after strangers i have a womens studies paper due next monday
5696470 look i havent said i wont help just that i need a bit more explanation who was l and why do you think she was kidnapped
5696471 l wasnt anyone really just a girl everyone knew everyone in the mews community but she wasnt mews herself
5696472 well thats just what we call ourselves mythological extraterrestrial weird and supernatural creatures l was a sort of friend of the community she was equally rude and bad tempered with everyone we liked that it meant she didnt treat us like freaks or like gods either
5696473 speak for yourself old man i happen to quite like being treated as a god myself
5696474 she came out to the bar every night and when she didnt show up for a few days we started getting a bit worried we think she might have been living on your campus so in order to find out what might have happened to her i suggested we might ask someone who goes to school there to help us
5696475 so why did your text say that shed been kidnapped im happy to help look around for her on campus if you think you know where she might have been staying
5696476 yes thats all a little look around campus to see if she left any sign of where shes gone off to im sure phones was just being dramatic if his text said something about kidnapping these young gods you know what are you going to do with them

5696491 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984 to 74 per cent between 1996 and 2001 which is great news but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
5696492 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
5696493 our research has also identified cancers where survival rates remain poor highlighting the need for continuing research in those areas to drive up survival
5696494 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people on to clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this

5696504 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours i think the right response is hard headed engagement
5696505 russia needs to live up to the commitments that president dmitry medvedev has made we are absolutely clear that force cannot be the basis for demarcation of new lines around russia
5696506 yeah look killing civilians not cool even if you think they belong to you knock it the feck off or were going to kick your ass

5696508 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites
5696509 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5696510 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5696511 the reason is that they broadcast disinformation during the war that affects our population badly and puts people under stress
5696512 i would not call it media what they broadcast and print is just propaganda and we dont want to scare our population with this disinformation
5696513 when we let them broadcast again we dont know lets see

5696515 so all these other water system across the country add significant amounts of fluoride get the levels up to government standards but we just happen to have naturally occuring fluoride that meets the government standards exactly
5696516 in a sweetheart deal these phosphate companies are spared the expense of disposing of this fluosilicic acid in a toxic waste dump
5696517 bryson writes with the skill of a top selling novelist but it was not his convincing storytelling that made me finish the book it was the haunting message that possibly here again was another therapeutic agent fluoride that had not been thoroughly studied before it was foisted on the public as a panacea to protect or improve health
5696518 whether or not brysons nuclear bomb connection is ever confirmed without a doubt this book demonstrates that there is still much that needs to be considered about the continued use of fluorine in future production and technology the nuclear product that required the use of fluorine ultimately killed 65 000 people outright in one sortie over japan the actual number of others since then and in generations to come who will have had their health insidiously undermined by artificial exposure to fluorides and other fluorine chemicals with half lives estimated in geologic time may well exceed that of the atom bomb victims millions and millions of times over
5696519 this agency regards such use as an ideal environmental solution to a long standing problem by recovering by product fluosilicic acid from fertilizer manufacturing water and air pollution are minimized and water utilities have a low cost source of fluoride available to them
5696520 so all these other water system across the country add significant amounts of fluoride get the levels up to government standards but we just happen to have naturally occuring fluoride that meets the government standards exactly

5696707 at one point she unravelled her scarf to reveal a low cut top which made steve blush as he got a close look
5696708 he followed this girl back to a corner where they were touching each others faces

5696712 hailed new language for the democratic partys platform that calls for reducing abortion
5696713 from my perspective as a conservative evangelical barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
5696714 inaccurately implied that catholic leaders shared the positive assessment the rev joel hunter gave the abortion plank of the democratic partys platform
5696715 the bishops have gone on record stating just the opposite and they are the ones who speak as the leaders of the catholic church in the united states and not political operatives for one party or another who happen to be catholic
5696716 in forming consciences for faithful citizenship the bishops wrote that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions and warned against a moral equivalence that would make no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity

5696719 as the news of the seventh blasts came in we knew that there more than 25 people were involved and we assessed that without the help of local ahmedabadis the anti national elements could not have planted bombs in such a perfect operation we made these two assumptions and they proved right we started looking within without wasting any time

5696728 some of the information is said to have been accessible through search engines like google you have to wonder if companies are making it this easy to discover information about individuals why do identity thieves go to all that effort of writing spyware

5696743 innocent customers should not be dragged into federal litigation just because they bought a product that other less scrupulous purchasers may be hacking for unlawful purposes
5696744 as part of the suit echostar subpoenaed 17 distributors of coolsat receivers demanding the names addresses phone numbers email addresses and other information of every person who purchased a coolsat receiver over the last five years
5696745 the court should recognize the privacy interests of these customers especially since echostar does not need these customer lists in order to have its day in court against freetech
5696746 once the names of freetech customers are disclosed to echostar there may be little that any court can do to protect these people from harassment settlement demands and legal expenses

5696761 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5696762 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5696763 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5696764 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5696765 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5696766 no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor senator mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states of america

5696771 this is why i will use the word collective to describe the association of humans and nonhumans and society to designate one part only of our collectives
5696772 the adjective modern designates a new regime an acceleration a rupture a revolution in time when the word modern modernization or modernity appears we are defining by contrast an archaic and stable past furthermore the word is always being thrown into the middle of a fight in a quarrel where there are winners and losers ancients and moderns modern is thus double asymmetrical it designates a break in the regular passage of time and it designates a combat in which there are victors and vanquished if so many of our contemporaries are reluctant to use this adjective today if we qualify it with prepositions it is because we feel less confident in our ability to maintain that double asymmetry we can no longer point to times irreversible arrow nor can we award a prize to the winners
5696773 modern designates two sets of entirely different practices which must remain distinct translation creates mixtures between entirely new types of beings hybrids of nature and culture the second by purification creates two entirely distinct ontological zones that of human beings on the one hand that of nonhumans on the other
5696774 the double separation is what we have to reconstruct the separation between humans and nonhumans on the one hand and between what happens above and what happens below on the other
5696775 in other words they are inventing our modern world a world in which the representation of things through the intermediary of the laboratory is forever dissociated from the representation of citizens through the intermediary of the social contract
5696776 everything happens in the middle everything passes between the two everything happens by what of mediation translation and networks but this space does not exist it has no place
5696777 no one has ever been modern modernity has never begun there has never been a modern world the use of the past perfect tense is important here for it is a matter of a retrospective sentiment of a rereading of our history i am not saying that we are entering a new era on the contrary we no longer have to continue the headlong flight of the post post postmodernists we are no longer obliged to cling to the avant garde we no longer seek to be even cleverer even more critical even deeper into the era of suspicion no instead we discover that we have never begun to enter the modern era hence the hint of the ludicrous that always accompanies postmodern thinkers they claim to come after a time that has not even started
5696778 is not society built literally not metaphorically of gods machines sciences arts and styles
5696779 with the postmoderns the abandonment of the modern project is consummated i have not found words ugly enough to designate this intellectual movement or rather this intellectual immobility though which humans and nonhumans are left to drift i call it hyper incommensurability
5696780 the moderns have a peculiar propensity for understanding time that passes as if it were really abolishing the past behind it
5696781 people are gong to distinguish the time bc and ac with respect to computers as they do the years before christ and after christ
5696782 it is the sorting that makes the times not the times that make the sorting
5696783 if you are looking for a good polite dedicated and loving companion please pay cecelia a visit
5696784 companies need to tell their deliverer to find out where goods come from and to eliminate it a scare like this definitely makes everyone pull their socks up
5696785 i do not know what happened here but we are taking this extremely seriously obviously something is lacking somewhere our deliverers carry out tests in the far east and then we send our own tests to the textile lab
5696786 we believe it is a problem that seems to be present in a variety of imported textiles and even if some regulations are not in place the swedish textile industry is willing to sort this out nobody wants to have environmentally dangerous chemicals making their into our water supply
5696787 it is good to make the change now as there will be plenty of time to put the next state secretary in place who will be responsible for looking after the swedish eu presidency next autumn
5696788 it is good that people like her become involved at that level
5696789 we want the press to understand the process we are taking
5696790 our goal is to have a state of the art alternative education program and we want the process to be as transparent as possible
5696791 stonewalling discovery giving plaintiff the runaround and lying to the court in an effort to delay its discovery obligations
5696792 in the context of an increasingly global economy and a world made smaller by technology it is more important than ever that students faculty and staff are prepared for active engagement with the international community
5696793 this generous gift will help expand our global emphasis ensuring that we remain competitive in a flat world
5696794 the 21st century transformation of the college includes not only sending our students out into the world but welcoming students from other countries to spelman
5696795 the addition of students from africa will serve to further educate and prepare the spelman community for global engagement

5696850 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
5696851 this is similar to russainhaxors thread only it contains the fundamentals

5696866 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
5696867 israel ziv and gal hirsch would come from time to time and watch us in action but we managed day to day operations ourselves
5696868 its not the standard we know in israel but when we left them they were at a good level they took the training very seriously there is a wider age range than in israel from 18 to 35 but they function very well over the past few days ive been following the news and i think they grasped a little of how to use strategy like we taught them it looks like we did a good job
5696869 we taught them counterterror and house to house fighting but that was very basic
5696870 i dont think the georgians would start fighting as long as the israeli forces where there
5696871 once when tension was high after russia shot down a drone we were evacuated to tbilisi

5696875 im a little tired its not easy to warm up in the morning
5696876 my point was to forget about what happened in the prelims and i did i came in this morning and its a brand new day and i felt better and mentally i felt much better than i did yesterday
5696877 i came back to priorities and what to think about at the right moment and it seems to be working out better for me
5696878 i am a bit disappointed that i missed the semifinal berth by a whisker but i am more experienced now i have lost many such matches so the defeat wont really haunt me
5696879 it was my first olympics and i never even dreamt that i will come this far reaching quarterfinals was most overwhelming
5696880 i hope i will be able to get gold in the next olympics which is my main aim now
5696881 i cant blame coaching or anything for that matter i was hasty during the match if i had played like i played in pre quarterfinals i would have definitely reached the semis it was my mistake
5696882 i was confident after my pre quarterfinal and i badly wanted to win the next match but it didnt work well that day i didnt keep patience
5696883 het album is al een tijdje af en ik begrijp niet waarom het zo lang duurt voor emi het uitbrengt
5696884 the posting is a malicious rumour and has not only misled netizens but also seriously damages the companys reputation

5696886 if liu xiang did not win the competition or even win a medal his value would definitely drop enormously and we could never make a return on lius huge fees
5696887 that would preserve liu xiangs face and as his sponsors we would not make too many losses

5696900 its fine to make calls for this if you dont take the responsibility for the article 5 defence but the reality is there are very few governments in nato willing to accelerate the process
5696901 ukraine of course has a large russian minority in the eastern part of country and particularly in the crimea the home base of the russian fleet its not inconceivable that the russians will say we have to protect the russian minority
5696902 essentially the bilateral relationship has to be resolved between kiev and moscow the is not a great deal the eu or nato can do in this context
5696903 the olympic sponsors claim to be good corporate citizens yet they were unwilling to address these abuses
5696904 but as they enjoy the games from the comfort of their seats at the olympic stadium they should reflect on their failure to speak up for the chinese citizens who built the stadium and their hotels clean their hotel rooms serve their meals or in the case of chinese journalists try to bring them their news

5696912 a total of 71 people were on the coach including the driver
5696913 unfortunately one man suffered fatal injuries and was confirmed dead at the scene
5696914 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5696915 due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties
5696916 what were also seeing is for the people who dont like it generally just dont get it
5696917 and its because weve created something so innovative and different its ironic it just shows that human nature of if you dont understand something you immediately attack it its pretty interesting in that regard

5696929 i am drawn to the conclusion that the crown cannot prove that the exertion and stress of the incident was the sole cause of the fatal arrhythmia

5696950 the government has declared war to us with the state of emergency
5696951 the defense minister antero flores ar oz has already confirmed that the combined forces are in the area of emergency the military already controls the camisea camps and roads beware a warned war does not kill people
5696952 we the native people we are not violent but we the indigenous peoples have decided to resist and to defend our territories
5696953 but they can leave when they do they have been seized only because they fired their weapons against our brothers
5696954 if the government is willing to talk here we are
5696955 the executive should seek solutions instead of chasing ghosts and blaming the ngos for the conflict
5696956 playing with peoples feelings they have created this situation and cowardly accused us being violent their statements are irresponsible and intransigent
5696957 indigenous peoples and the amazon no longer bear so much pollution of the rivers
5696958 indigenous peoples are demanding a direct dialogue with the executive a multi disciplinary dialogue because there are too many problems to solve in the amazon
5696959 indigenous peoples and the amazon region cannot longer bear so much pollution of rivers and the forests is destroyed because of the lack of public policies that can guarantee an effective protection of their territories
5696960 a new ministry that just started is not going to solve the many problems we have in the amazon
5696961 this is a step taken by the indigenous people of the amazon that have been forgotten for so long we are already tired of consuming water polluted by oil corporations many children are sick
5696962 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the oil pipeline and gas through the camisea gas pipeline
5696963 they have mobilized themselves for the right to life the right to keep their territory and to defend the environment the amazon rainforest which is the lungs of the world
5696964 the state has the obligation to guarantee the right of all peruvians when others violate them so order has to be established let us be absolutely clear on this
5696965 sustainable developmental initiatives are gaining importance today with dubai already having taken the lead in designing and promoting green energy efficient buildings mushrif heights is part of emaaremaars commitment to this social responsibility and we are creating a new eco friendly community where the focus is on integrating every day living with the natural environment

5696967 dopo tanti anni di analisi arrivato pupi e mi ha risolto i problemi scherzi a parte devo ammettere che il ruolo che mi ha chiesto di interpretare davvero molto difficile
5696968 io sono madre ma mi sento ancora anche molto figlia spiega lattrice probabilmente non un caso che allinizio abbia rifiutato questa parte una madre che abbandona la figlia colpevole di omicidio e se ne disinteressa insomma la madre che nessuno vorrebbe mai avere per riuscire a interpretarla stato fondamentale il punto di vista maschile di pupi io da donna non riuscivo a trovare giustificazioni per questa figura perci mi sembrava impossibile riproporla sullo schermo

5696977 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5696978 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming

5696994 i wish i could just swallow one little pill and not have to sit through this meal thing
5696995 todays methods of scientific and engineering investigation range from theoretical experimental to computational science
5696996 additionally with globally addressable memory growing to terascale sizes a plethora of new huge memory applications that profoundly improve scientific and engineering productivity will come on line from these may emerge a new branch of computational science called data intensive methods it includes the traditional method of query to the more abstract methods of inference and even interactive data exploration the availability of such a powerful range of interactive methods for operation on terascale data sets all residing in monolithic globally addressable memory is a novel combination that will not only facilitate intended discoveries but may also give rise to a new complement which i will call planned serendipity the latter will be of growing significance in intelligence science and engineering and as the amount of data generated by faster and more productive systems grows visualization will increasingly become an essential tool the recent advances in display and related technologies could pave the way for revolutionary new ways of visual interactive and collaborative communications
5696997 sgis focus on memory management stems from us seeing a rising concern from our government customers with the deluge of data they are getting
5696998 what we did was tinker with the idea of putting an entire database in memory numalink allows multiple nodes to be tied tightly together so that all the memory pieces are seen as one once the processors can see all the memory across all nodes as a single memory then they can load a large database entirely into that memory so a complex query that would normally take seconds to return a response because the disk query takes some time to scan the database could be returned in under a second when we went out with the idea we got enthusiastic responses we heard how it could fundamentally change the discovery process when you ask questions with complex queries you sit and wait for a response it breaks the thinking process because you might want to converge on an idea by quickly firing off questions and getting quick responses you want to have a conversation with the data
5696999 the storm is deteriorating and it doesnt look like we are going to have much worse than the weather now
5697000 pues mira siempre he tenido que picar piedra el futbol me ha ense ado a mi edad que hay momentos positivos y hay rachas donde no se dan las cosas pero que no hay que desesperarse el futbol es un deporte en conjunto y cuando el equipo est jugando bien es m s probable que uno se pueda ver mejor en lo individual eso puede explicar un poco este cambio
5697001 obviamente a uno le pone triste cuando las cosas no le van bien es dif cil te da tristeza porque tu familia lo est sufriendo tambi n porque la gente quiere ver algo m s de ti pero algo de lo que me ha ense ado mi familia es de tratar de poner buena cara ante la adversidad y con la confianza de que con dios todo va a mejorar
5697002 por supuesto que me ha pasado muchas veces he querido tirar la toalla
5697003 no para anda yo digo que me exijan eso es mucho mejor porque me ayuda a no darme por vencido a sacar fuerza hambre car cter y para que las cosas salgan bien con ello he ganado mucha experiencia
5697004 por supuesto me siento muy bien jugando d nde me ha colocado el profe manuel lapuente pero ahora hay que mantener la calma poner los pies sobre la tierra porque a n no he ganado nada
5697005 yo pienso igual que el profe lapuente por supuesto que tigres tiene pasta de campe n como me toc vivirlo en pumas pero tenemos que ir paso a paso pero tambi n sabemos que no queda s lo con decirlo
5697006 s es un equipo que tiene mucha garra deseos mucha hambre de triunfo y de salir campe n adem s pumas tambi n ten a tiempo de no ser campe n pero lo m s importante es que est bien dirigido y tiene jugadores con estilo parecido entonces eso me ilusiona m s de que se puede lograr el t tulo
5697007 claro a la selecci n jam s la voy olvidar y claro que quiero estar en el pr ximo mundial
5697008 vamos a ver estos dos d as su evoluci n es probable que pueda hacer f tbol el mi rcoles o jueves pero dependemos de c mo se vaya sintiendo
5697009 ellos tienen su estilo muy definido y creo que ser un partido donde el primero que se equivoque le van a marcar gol
5697010 viene un encuentro contra el superl der contra un equipo muy complicado con un estilo de juego muy parecido al nuestro seguramente va a ser un partido de un gol
5697011 ser a interesante ganar y estar dentro de los primeros lugares

5697338 weve designed our solar modules specifically for the electrical utilities scale market
5697339 a year ago we designed a solar module and a manufacturing system to produce it in january we began building a manufacturing facility near portland oregon to start we will build about 25 megawatts of production capacity which represents approximately 200 000 marketable solar panels per year and then grow that capacity to 35 megawatts by improving our system performance and adding work shifts we then plan to begin efforts to scale to 100 megawatts of manufacturing capacity by some time in 2010
5697340 our modules are designed for the electrical utilities scale market where thousands of solar modules are used in each power field we have started bidding projects for utilities and government agencies to install our modules the second part of our target market is the conventional installer and integrator where we have received significant requests for purchases of our modules in 2009 and later
5697341 the electrical market is enormous to keep up with demand the utilities are reaching out for new power production methods that are clean and safe long term these power fields are great investments that can provide a 5 year payback on the average installation and then you have 15 years of cash flow with low operating costs we see this trend picking up significantly and have positioned ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity

5697405 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5697411 each development team is free to use whatever local support it likes in this vm amazon doesnt care the creators of one application might choose a java ee app server and mysql for example while another group might go with ruby on rails ec2 customers are even free to create many linux instances then distribute large workloads across them in parallel such as for scientific applications while the service ec2 provides is quite basic its also very general and so it can be used in many different ways
5697412 microsoft also provides local support for applications in the cloud as part of its crm live offering based on the dynamics crm platform mentioned earlier this technology targets data oriented business applications much like force com and like both force com and appengine it includes both run time application support and a data store microsoft has also talked about its plans to go further in this area with a platform that will support standard net development languages and tools the intent microsoft says is to allow portability of both applications and developer skills between the companys on premises foundation and its cloud foundation

5697542 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

5697581 since the gospel is so despised i suppose that judgment day is not far away not over a hundred years gods word will decline again and fall and because of a lack of upright and faithful servants of the word a great darkness will come then the whole world will turn wild and people will live wild and abandoned lives in all security but then the voice will come and ring out behold the bridegroom cometh matthew 25 6 for god will not be able to put up with conditions any longer
5697582 in light of the other priority investigations being conducted and the limitations on security service mi5 resources the decisions not to give greater investigative priority to these two individuals were understandable
5697583 it is possible that this indicates he had difficulty setting off his device
5697584 no apparent significance in the choice of 7 july as the date for the attacks
5697585 was in contact with others involved in extremism in the uk
5697586 reflect one strand of an investigation that was subsequently discounted by the intelligence and security agencies
5697587 clearly illustrated the possibility of british nationals becoming involved in terrorist activity
5697588 security service investigations and successful disruptions in the uk revealed that british born citizens were involved in plotting attacks on their home soil
5697589 greater coverage in pakistan or more resources generally in the uk might have alerted the security agencies to the intentions of the 7 july group
5697590 seems highly unlikely that it will be possible to stop all attacks

5697596 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
5697597 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
5697598 we will never forget those who lost their lives and those who were injured
5697599 this is a major step in the right direction and there is still a lot of work to do on the detail to make sure it is a fair system
5697600 personally be deeply disappointed if it did not help those who had fallen through the cracks by not having access to a state compensation scheme or insurance
5697601 we welcome the governments decision to look at resources for victims of terrorist acts here and abroad but we wonder whether a million pounds will be enough if its merely going to be for compensation

5697648 oh well i cant say much about the film at this point of time but yes it will be my kind of cinema i dont want to prove a point to anybody happy new year will be a commercial entertainer
5697649 i am not going to exotic places to write the story and while i am busy with the script i am concentrating on my babies too
5697650 i catch up with shah rukh and karan johar often recently shah rukh was shooting at yash raj studios and i dropped by to visit him with anya diva and czar in tow of course i had also taken three of my maids who i have for my kids it was good fun
5697651 karan wanted me to do a song in dostana moreover i had promised tarun mansukhani dostanas director that i will choreograph a song in the first film which he will direct
5697652 incidentally note that the moment im referring yash chopra seems to be showing interest in the rab ne is shaping up lets see the first the only thing i should say here is that comparisons of akshay with bachchan are more than a little silly london will be a blast i am sure
5697653 the director and actor brought out the best in each other
5697654 the word rai forms a part of every question salman khan asks his guests on the show
5697655 incidentally note that the moment im referring yash chopra seems to be showing interest in the rab ne is shaping up lets see the first the only thing i should say here is that comparisons of akshay with bachchan are more than a little silly london will be a blast i am sure
5697656 the director and actor brought out the best in each other
5697657 incidentally note that the moment im referring yash chopra seems to be showing interest in the rab ne is shaping up lets see the first the only thing i should say here is that comparisons of akshay with bachchan are more than a little silly london will be a blast i am sure
5697658 the director and actor brought out the best in each other
5697659 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5697660 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5697661 im going to play next week im going to be fine
5697662 its bengals about to prove again why they are losers
5697663 our home looks like a dormitory now because so many relatives have arrived
5697664 we dont have enough space in our three rooms but its our duty to receive them
5697665 azerbaijan recognises georgias territorial integrity and believes that the conflict must be settled within the framework of international law
5697666 our president preferred to stay and watch the olympics and keep silent while the presidents of several other friendly countries personally arrived in tbilisi and expressed their support for president saakashvili
5697667 i think that this position can be explained by the president of azerbaijans commitment to good relations with the leadership of russia and his wish to preserve stability in the country on the eve of the forthcoming presidential elections
5697668 its obvious that russia shouldnt be driven crazy because we have seen the consequences
5697669 the ambassadors desire to evade tricky questions from azerbaijani journalists
5697670 the conflict between georgia and ossetia will definitely have an impact on the karabakh conflict if the conflict ends with russias full control over georgia it will be very bad for azerbaijan georgia is our only route for our energy and transport projects to reach the outside world
5697671 many of those in azerbaijan who have called for a military solution to the nagorny karabakh conflict have learned what lies in store for a country which defies russia but has no real allies
5697672 the forgotten caucasian conflicts have become a focus of attention of the world
5697673 the decision to leave the cis is georgias internal affair each country has the right to take decisions independently
5697674 as soon as we started oil deliveries via the baku novorossiysk pipeline russia started experiencing some problems
5697675 this once again shows that the baku novorossisk pipeline cannot be used as the main route to export azerbaijani resources to europe our main routes pass through georgia in the future we must pay more attention to their security
5697676 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
5697677 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories
5697678 there is a lot of stuff i still wanted to
5697679 celebrities almost never look good unless they are out at something or other while real fashion animals always look a little interesting even if they are only going to starbucks
5697680 my house flipping partner bob pope entered this contest already he knew i was also a big fan of
5697681 mommy says you broke the hi fi i believe her dont do it again
5697682 you act like theres some younger fresher version of us there isnt
5697683 whoa take it easy i dont want to wake up pregnant
5697684 hes young hes good looking hes in the army whats not to love about nixon
5697685 honestly im doing so much stuff for dark horse that im not sure what the hell theyre talking about
5697686 theyve offered me the chance to write it and even co direct weve got all the same players involved as before now were just trying to make the deal
5697687 theatrical or straight to dvd id be interested depending on the budget and the cast if we do a sequel wed have to at least get melissa george
5697688 we tried to get it made before and it just didnt happen and now jay russell the water horse has got it off the ground all of a sudden this project i thought was completely dead is alive again which is really fitting for a frankenstein project
5697689 before i was just selling off properties and i didnt really have much to do with getting the stuff made into a movie
5697690 now im working with directors working with talent trying to get it directly to the screen
5697691 im starting a script for him right now i think theyll be announcing it very soon
5697692 theyll announce the studio and the title its based on an old comic one that i didnt write
5697693 thats the strangest thing ive ever heard i dont even know what that is and i dont know who any of these people are
5697694 anybody is primed to be a victim thats why i dont read reviews anymore you cant theres no criteria for what a review is you pick up a review and its just someone who decided that day that he hates your guts i read something on a website i check out regularly there was a guy who wrote a whole paragraph about how hed never read my stuff but that he heard i had a bad reputation thats pretty much a non article isnt it thats the nature of things now anyone who can type can post their opinions online
5697695 ive been of doing this stuff twenty odd years before nobody got a lot of attention they used to run our comic book covers in articles but now they run our photos
5697696 i get recognized but the people that stop me arent the ones that freak me out i think its really cool and often wind up talking to them a little while whats weird is walking through the crowd and hearing my name somewhere off in the distance thats strange to actually have people recognize you is very surreal but im not going to knock it because i actually get to talk to people who buy my books and read my stuff i welcome as much contact from them as i can get
5697697 i wish there was more of a range we get occasional big studio horror which they inevitably decide to make pg 13 or youve got the independent spirited stuff but its got totally over the top violence
5697698 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5697699 he can run that kind of campaign but i believe the american people are better than that
5697700 we were thrilled to be back at trois rivieres for the first time in five years and this was the perfect event for us to announce our 35th anniversary atlantic championship all star team

5697756 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5697757 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5697758 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan
5697759 senator mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks and that as despicable as saddam hussein was posed no imminent threat to the american people
5697760 finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5697761 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5697762 the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
5697763 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5697764 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5697765 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america

5698116 i mean a final solution as envisaged by easykill for cockroaches or you see any other solution for cyprus getting rid of the turkish plague tim if you know then tell me all i see is turks invading us killing us and sending more and more settlers to give to them the lands they stole from us they started in 1571 and they continue until 2008 do you see any other way we can get back what is ours tell me tim because we have been trying with negotiations for 34 years and you see that the turks have not changed one iota with just giving them words they want some nice metal passing throw their heads that is the only thing that will definitely chance their minds
5698117 we cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry we know too well that we become like them and mr obama will run this country in their mindset
5698118 the democrats have targeted young people knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds i know this process well i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement
5698119 those same leaders who were in the streets in the 60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the iraq war and to attack our president and they have found their way into our schools
5698120 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5698121 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
5698122 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
5698123 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
5698124 well what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness

5698201 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients
5698202 however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
5698203 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources

5698219 der prozess liegt brach er ist aber noch nicht tot
5698220 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5698221 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5698222 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5698223 young bulls struggle to hold on to his heritage will touch childrens sense of justice and lead to some interesting discussions and perhaps further research
5698224 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5698225 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5698226 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5698227 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5698228 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5698229 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5698230 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5698231 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5698232 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5698233 victims are unknown to them prior to the injury event and the clinicians frequently need to make rapid life and death decisions with little time to determine victims values and preferences for care
5698234 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5698235 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5698236 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5698237 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5698238 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5698239 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5698240 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5698241 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5698242 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5698243 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5698244 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5698245 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5698246 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5698247 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5698248 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5698249 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5698250 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5698251 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5698252 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5698253 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent
5698254 thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
5698255 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5698256 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5698257 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5698258 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5698259 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5698260 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5698261 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5698262 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5698263 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5698264 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5698265 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5698266 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5698267 this is an excellent book it should be read by all who are interested in any aspect of tuberculosis including the growing problem of multi drug resistant tuberculosis
5698268 the book serves an important function relaying statistics and tb hot spots proposing funding and international standardized treatments
5698269 blood and marrow transplantation from unrelated donors has been routinely utilized to treat treatment refractory leukemia and lymphoma for almost two decades
5698270 preliminary results from the few unrelated donor transplants that have been performed for other non malignant conditions show great promise for those who suffer a severely diminished quality of life due to sickle cell disease participants in this large scale study will help us understand how to better treat and possibly even cure sickle cell disease for more people

5698274 as far as i am concerned ehud barak is a traitor because when he withdrew the idf from lebanon he said that the children of the sla members are children of the state of israel and today those children dont even have a house

5698311 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
5698312 to me at the end of my run little did he know his greeting gave me the inspiration to run just a bit farther than usual
5698313 human life is too precious and it is too unworthy of man to meet death or become an invalid due to causes that could mostly be avoided
5698314 there is certainly a need for a greater sense of responsibility above all by drivers as accidents are often caused by excessive speed and imprudent conduct
5698315 driving on public roads calls for moral and civic sense
5698316 hey ill share my pew with an extraterrestrial any day
5698317 it might be the case that aliens had discarded theology and religious practice long ago as primitive superstition and would rapidly convince us to do the same
5698318 alternatively if they retained a spiritual aspect to their existence we would have to concede that it was likely to have developed to a degree far ahead of our own if they practiced anything remotely like a religion we should surely soon wish to abandon our own and be converted to theirs
5698319 upon confirmation of contact between earth and an extraterrestrial civilization of intelligent beings the long established religious traditions of earth would confront a crisis of belief and perhaps even collapse
5698320 would so undercut my beliefs that my beliefs would face a crisis
5698321 i believe that christ became incarnate human in order to redeem humanity and atone for the original sin of adam and eve could there be a world of extraterrestrials maybe it doesnt change what christ did
5698322 within the scope of christian theology it appears that little if any beliefs preclude the existence of extraterrestrial beings
5698323 their presence would at most widen the scope of ones understanding of creation and create some puzzles for how christians understand the work of salvation
5698324 it appears that people who embrace a traditional religious belief system do not fear for their own personal belief nor are they particularly worried about their own respective religious tradition a shred of evidence suggests that believers in one religious tradition might be more inclined to impute fragility to other religions to which they do not subscribe or about which they know little
5698325 non religious people seem to know too little about religious people because they are mistaken in their assessment of the fragility of religious beliefs
5698326 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5698327 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
5698328 if we get to the point where we believe we have a viable hypothesis that works in the lab then we have scientific grounds to go to turin and say heres what we think has happened to the shroud
5698329 if you love christ why wouldnt you want to explore the possibility that you have an artifact of his material existence on earth
5698330 how i think about the shroud comes from the shroud its not gee im a christian so ill force it to be what i want it to be thats not scientific logic
5698331 we have to be able to address these various parameters and we have at the moment only one reaction chamber to be able to do all these different experiments any one experiment takes a considerable amount of time to perform
5698332 its going to take months to several years i would say
5698333 its important that we bring the radiocarbon community into this project through oxford so we are not leaving it just to us to say that the radiocarbon dating of shroud was in error if indeed it is so that they can be partners in that

5698335 im very pleased to see the very wide interest in the shroud

5698340 we have said to the company to use that for work space

5698425 we are at risk of entering if there is not a very rapid evolution on the ground into a relationship which will be of a different nature to what it was until now
5698426 such actions seriously complicate the general situation and impede the withdrawal process
5698427 it was expected that access service providers will provide highly popular services like internet telephony and boost broadband penetration but it has not happened on the ground
5698428 there seems to be complete market failure as our subscribers are denied advanced value added services in contrast to the world scenario where such internet based services are very popular
5698429 isps are not permitted to provide unrestricted internet telephony though they have internet protocol ip based infrastructure
5698430 such regulatory restrictions discourage technological advancements and the result is grey market activities to provide these services
5698431 nld national long distance providers shall make suitable commercial and technical arrangements with access providers pstn plmn and isps to facilitate internet telephony call termination on pstn plmn and isps
5698432 based on the study appropriate number blocks may be earmarked for internet telephony in newly recommended 11 digit numbering plan
5698433 internet telephony will play a very positive role in increasing rural teledensity for whom the current long distance tariffs are still unaffordable
5698434 in rural areas there are nearly 20 000 exchanges which are connected through reliable media these exchanges can help broadband penetration in rural areas
5698435 presently there are 11 64 million rural wireline subscribers at end of march 2008 which is declining provisions of broadband connections will not only provide value added services and applications to our rural subscribers but will also arrest declining trend of wireline subscribers and improve business model s of telecom operator s serving in rural area s
5698436 internet telephony in india could become the killer app for broadband penetration which has sadly lagged far behind the very successful mobile telephony in india

5698469 alright i dont care if its good or not my kid just wants it what do i need to know about it
5698470 hey the untapped thing is definitely the whole family thing
5698471 this is another symptom of the decline of the way games are being built
5698472 you know what you know what im working on at works not for me anymore
5698473 okay this isnt the thing that i thought it was
5698474 alright so my kid wants gears of war and its m rated and it says blood and gore intense violence and strong language on the back alright i got a pretty broad idea of what that means but what specifically is it
5698475 okay this is what this game has in it if you allow this game into your house this is whats in it
5698476 how is my kid going to respond to this specific type of content
5698477 this is what a movie is about uh but its got this bit in it that if youve got little kids they might find its a bit scary
5698478 and i think just knowing that cos like my little one when the dvd was on hed know when the frank part in cars was coming
5698479 alright what i need to know is whats in it is there gonna be a part that spooks them
5698480 theres no drugs in this what the hell were they talking about
5698481 what was this though is it potions is that what theyre talking about is it the fact that youre taking these like
5698482 we have this game and i was fine with it because of these reasons
5698483 yeah i really liked burnout but the music was quite angry im not sure if i wanted all that angry punk and metal you know im not sure if i want my kids
5698484 oh the car crashes made my kid start slamming his car into the furniture
5698485 well i already decided thats good so you know you just validated my opinion of that
5698486 okay its m rated but i think its okay for a 14 year old say
5698487 yeah you know its okay its mostly blue and green blood so its fine
5698488 look its okay for us all to have our threshold somewhere different and this is where mine is and these people agree and these people dont
5698489 thank god you said that cos i do that too
5698490 hey you know i heard that you were doing this
5698491 oh my kid really wants to play videogames but i know nothing about it can you come and help me
5698492 yeah dont tell me what to think just help me think better
5698493 how long is too long my kid locks himself up in a room for hours and i wanna put a time limit on it but because i have no frame of reference for the experience i dont know where to put a cap on it my gut is i dunno an hour
5698494 i told my kid he can only play for an hour and then i call up and say you gotta turn it off now and hell say hes not played it yet how is that possible
5698495 well he could be spending an hour painting his car
5698496 hey lets sit down together and set up a team together
5698497 lets sit down in forza and build the car i had when i was 18
5698498 okay this is what the console is these are the costs these are the hidden costs that you might not know about here are the parental controls that it offers
5698499 well they want this new they really love cars they want this this mater game
5698500 well is it white is it black does it have a green ring on the front
5698501 this is fantastic this is fantastic but it choked here or it did this thing i didnt want it to do here
5698502 okay well i probably wouldve responded that way as well
5698503 alright starting from scratch thinking about a completely different kind of audience how do we want to talk to them
5698504 mire se or ust estaba al borde pero no se preocupe todo estar bien
5698505 i dont solicit all this press coverage the press finds me i think that the press finds me because im colorful im not shy i have an opinion and i frankly really dont care if someone agrees or disagrees with it im willing to share
5698506 the controversy the invective that i get comes primarily from the games industry people always writing me emails and asking me what do you think about this
5698507 i publish my monthly console and handheld hardware numbers because the neogaf guys think its so fun
5698508 but no ones ever asked to see my annual forecast for all those things im spot on for my annual forecast id love to see those guys put out a contest for annual forecasts for the next five years and then well compare my numbers to theirs because ive been spot on for five or six years now
5698509 the average neogaf visitor isnt equipped to actually prepare those things
5698510 because it requires you to make an assumption about pricing and ive been great on that as well its hard to do
5698511 i love the innovation i love the opportunistic rapid market response i think this companys going to earn a lot more money than most people do
5698512 im just making an economic argument not so much a suggestion
5698513 prices of next gen games arent going up youre seeing collectors editions at 70 youre seeing the gta collectors at 90 guitar hero 90 people dont even blink they stand in line for the thing
5698514 i just meant that the public is willing to spend more for the content that they want
5698515 again adjusted for inflation the old psone game in 1995 that came out at 49 99 would be probably about 70 bucks right now just at 3 percent inflation compounded for the last 12 years youd be up over 70 on an apples to apples basis 60 is a bargain and the content of a ps3 game is a lot greater or an xbox 360 game than the content of the first generation psone games
5698516 i would say what ties it all together is the economy the economy of the game is very much controlled by the players all prices are decided on the market ccp doesnt set a price on it and then the game very much focuses on the fact that youre always at risk in terms of all the players attacking you or taking something away from you so that creates very interesting interactions between war and the economy
5698517 war and economy is something that has created a lot of events in human history that is essentially what we maybe have put in place to drive the storyline but then the players have used those systems to create something much more spectacular than we could ever have envisioned in the beginning so i would say the economy is the tool to create this
5698518 for soliciting community feedback we have used various methods throughout the four years and were trying to evolve those as our world has evolved you use different methods for a community of 50 000 players than you do for a community of 200 000 players especially when all those players live in the same world its different when you have sharded worlds down to smaller shards and you just have more shards and you have to tackle the community of each shard then you can use the same method but scale it up but when the community fundamentally grows as it has in our case then you have to adapt and evolve your method of soliciting community feedback and were now at this fanfest introducing a new idea which we call the council of stellar management which involves allowing the community to elect representatives for a council and well do this through voting so this council will then be a venue for exchange between the community and ccp so that it is a more meaningful discussion than us talking in a non structured way with 200 000 people which um achieves very little in its current form
5698519 e3 to me this year felt more like it was being done out of habit than anything else there werent any big surprises really just about every game that we saw we knew was coming had already seen at a game day event with rare exception we pretty much had already heard everything everyone had to say it just felt like we were all kind of there because we all get together for e3 every year
5698520 obviously there was no kentia hall so there goes a lot of the obscure the korean the sort of the variety of stuff that you would see over in kentia hall that was deliberate on the part of the esa in previous years they had allowed a range of smaller publishers to draft on their coattails as they saw it and this year they decided not to do that for me coming from newsweek i tend to have to cover some of the bigger games with a mix of smaller games and i am personally more interested in indie games than ive been in the past and again because i couldnt get over to barker hanger i couldnt see those
5698521 i go to a news conference for news and little news was being made you have all these companies these video game publishers that are based in the united states yet sony and their third parties just announced a whole slew of new games in japan immediately following e3 and its not even tokyo game show what does that say when those games could have been announced at e3
5698522 i know the japanese market needs a boost as far as the ps3 is concerned but what does that say about north americas position in the global game market when sony can just have its own event not even a full week after e3 and unveil a slate of new games from itself and third parties and it s not even tgs

5698529 the holiday season is upon us and with it comes the launch of not one but two new consoles and a veritable tsunami of games some great some not so great
5698530 often discussions among game educators are reduced to the question of
5698531 peaceably i have come to sacrifice to the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice
5698532 go now see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock and bring word back to me
5698533 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
5698534 youre going to get killed or get to do some killing
5698535 oh my god see there was a problem the first time they did the hair that first press release i dont know there was some confusion over how to do it
5698536 we have a lot of producers and we have a lot of input coming from all different directions and so they decided to straighten my hair
5698537 my hairs naturally curly its also naturally brown so they dyed my hair for the part they tried straightening it and it came out looking awful
5698538 i got to keep my natural hair which is curly but usually kind of hangs down and they wanted to see my face so they pushed it up and out so basically that early look was not my decision at all its just the way things played out
5698539 your super district council people have to run the larger campaigns and spend the most money for these campaigns
5698540 these would be people representing half the city who would be in a much stronger position to challenge an incumbent mayor so they should have to run on the same cycle as the mayor
5698541 we did it to ensure that there would be an african american majority on the memphis city council
5698542 we felt that the demographics of both of these districts would remain this way for a longer period of time and that would guarantee three white members from one half three black members from the other
5698543 if we say even and odd that would mean that one of these super districts would never be able to run against the mayor unless they resign the other would
5698544 if we take those two super districts and treat them differently and there is a difference in the racial makeup of those two that right now would be considered disparate impact no matter what happens in the future
5698545 the concern is just that its possible for someone to challenge that who would do so and would be the minority thats more complicated
5698546 as we move forward the considerations that have been made in the past are those considerations going to be less defensible as we move forward
5698547 in the past we used in our lexicon minority well who is a minority were not doing things for today were doing things for decades in the future

5698571 for over 30 years now millions of americans have played video and computer games and this pastime has become an important part of american culture yet as this entertainment medium grows it has also become a frequent target of criticism and legislation the video game voters network working to protect the rights of americans who play video games and is first line of defense against legislative threats the network enables you to stay updated about issues and to voice your concerns to your elected officials whats really at stake government regulation based on games content will stifle creativity and inadvertently cause game publishers to dilute content due to the threat of government action and fines game content is constitutionally protected just like movies books and cable tv so why should games be subject to a higher level of scrutiny these legislative threats would create a double standard for this innovative medium join today and take a stand protect your games

5698574 henry jenkins has cited the fact that media messages are most effective when they tend to reinforce the values beliefs and preconceptions of the reader listener or viewer
5698575 the leading contender partly due to his working class roots and foreign policy expertise
5698576 the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects also works so produced
5698577 i did indeed consider video games inherently inferior to film and literature there is a structural reason for that video games by their nature require player choices which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature which requires authorial control t he nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship however elegant or sophisticated to the stature of art to my knowledge no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists poets filmmakers novelists and composers for most gamers video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured civilized and empathetic
5698578 art is something that radiates the artist the person who creates that piece of art if 100 people walk by and a single person is captivated by whatever that piece radiates its art but videogames arent trying to capture one person a videogame should make sure that all 100 people that play that game should enjoy the service provided by that videogame its something of a service its not art but i guess the way of providing service with that videogame is an artistic style a form of art
5698579 lets be clear here all games are art in a superficial sense we could point to examples of in game assets which could be described as professionally competent and well produced in a higher sense we look for works that create new expressive experiences or push a medium to places it hasnt gone before
5698580 art is the stuff you find in the museum whether it be a painting or a statue what im doing what videogame creators are doing is running the museum how do we light up things where do we place things how do we sell tickets its basically running the museum for those who come to the museum to look at the art for better or worse what i do hideo kojima myself is run the museum and also create the art thats displayed in the museum
5698581 maybe lets say theres a game out there where theres a boss that you cannot defeat its made that way normally when you beat the boss in a game theres a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment but if you cant beat the boss at all if what youre left with is a sense of loss then maybe that could be defined as art
5698582 thats why you want to think about art and videogames i think the lousiest videogames can be considered art because bad games with no fun arent really games by definition
5698583 how to use and abuse the gaming press and how the gaming press wants to use and abuse you

5698592 the united states is the land of opportunity its the best country in the world and im just glad to represent it
5698593 the frustration was let out the hard work and everything
5698594 i set my goal i trained hard i had a good staff around me i just put the pieces together and i really believed in myself
5698595 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to represent the u s
5698596 not too many mexicans get the chance to do that
5698597 we always moved forward we always moved forward my mom always taught us to suck it up and whatever you want to do you can do
5698598 at the olympic trials in las vegas she couldnt take it
5698599 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment that he came from
5698600 could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that hes done an unbelievable job of not being a victim
5698601 he is the american dream gold medals are the american dream
5698602 i think its a grasshopper but it looks like a leaf
5698603 i had heard little whispers that rio had got it he has been in awesome form on the pitch
5698604 it means the world to me to retain the captaincy it makes me very proud and is extra special this time i have 14 games experience as captain and now my target is to help england qualify for the world cup in south africa in 2010
5698605 we need to concentrate on qualifying it is our sole target after the disappointment of not advancing to the european championship finals this summer
5698606 i have shown what i can do on and off the pitch messers capello jose mourinho and luiz felipe scolari have seen something special in me
5698607 when rio was captain in a friendly he played very well it was very hard to choose
5698608 john has a big personality thats why i chose john rio is very important to the team he will be vice captain
5698609 false start some would love if that was the case and i have a feeling they are just trying to create self doubt within us
5698610 we managed to progress in the dfb pokal and we didnt lose the opener
5698611 after the 2 0 lead against hsv we really should have closed the bag
5698612 my desire to be in the european championships was already considered ludicrous by many
5698613 the only way to convince a coach to call you is to play well and the fact lippi already knows me is irrelevant i dont want special treatment
5698614 i dont see the problem i understand that not everybody likes me and some lean on my age or the idea i cannot repeat last season but at times they do so in order to defend their opinions
5698615 all i know is i will enter the new campaign with the same determination to always be at my best i am not a player who relies entirely on athleticism
5698616 del piero is like wine the more it ages the better it gets
5698617 i think everybody realises it means the world to me
5698618 i was a little bit shocked to be fair rio has been in awesome form on the pitch for man united in what he has achieved in the last year and before that he has been fantastic
5698619 for me to get it above the likes of him and the other players in the squad means an awful lot to me
5698620 hes gay youre gay you have so much in common
5698621 update went back last night seduced by the lure of sandwiches
5698622 it means the world to me to retain the armband especially with the players in the squad who are playing so well and have achieved so much over the last couple of years to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5698623 id never given up on the chance to wear the armband once again and never will do it is a very proud moment for me today i heard little whispers that rio ferdinand had got it but i am absolutely delighted and have got to make the most of it
5698624 i think the big personality of john is the reason i choose him the captain is important because he is the driver of the team
5698625 i remember that john and rio were captains very well it is not easy for me to choose the captain they are both very good players
5698626 n o foi uma escolha f cil por que o rio ferdinand um jogador muito importante
5698627 eu gosto dele como capit o ele muito bom mas eu escolhi o terry porque precisamos de um capit o com uma grande personalidade
5698628 mostrei o tipo de jogador que sou ao treinador e consegui me recuperar daquilo que foi uma grande decep o pra mim
5698629 talvez ele tenha me ajudado com isso pois me deu grande motiva o ao me dar a bra adeira
5698630 for all we know there is a gay rower or badminton player somewhere known as gay within his or her sport but not in a larger public context
5698631 its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together
5698632 the vast majority of olympic athletes are under 30 a time when even people who are not elite jocks are wrestling with their sexuality
5698633 being an olympic athlete requires full time dedication and a lot of things get put on hold it is just easier to hide and deal with ones sexuality later
5698634 when we were alerted over the incident the police promptly raced to the area only to discover the lifeless body of mr
5698635 i dont know why it happened that way i cant explain it

5698643 i learned to drive aged seven in one of my fathers 2cvs so there was no hesitation when it came to choosing a car to drive away from the church on our wedding day

5698670 being a buffalo based company and understanding the current rough patch in our economy we are very excited to offer area businesses the opportunity to reap the benefits of powerpay wny
5698671 its great to be able to spark the economy and put western new york in the national spotlight for something positive
5698672 we have essentially equated the ability of a larger electricity user to shift its demand for electricity a couple times a year from high peak to off peak periods to a power plant supplying power to the grid
5698673 it is a simple recognition that reducing demand in these grid tenuous times is as good if not better than simply adding more supply to what is already an over extended transmission infrastructure
5698674 we have been participating in a program similar to powerpay new york for a number of years and are proud of the success we have had in reducing our electricity consumption through the years
5698675 ecs is a great local company with a knowledgeable and friendly team making our participation in demand response extremely easy

5698679 forever 21 development on south central farm site is protested
5698680 the mayor negotiated on behalf of the farmers with the developer of a forever 21 distribution center and he took money from the company that stood to gain the most if he lost that negotiation to promote his pet projects the bad faith villaraigosa demonstrated is unconscionable and suggests to a pay to play mentality in the citys development racket
5698681 we are requesting the state attorney general investigate not only villaraigosa but all the key players in the sale city attorney rocky delgadillo the port commissioners and the members of the city council for entanglements with forever 21 and collusion to throw the land transfer to horowitz
5698682 the mayors betrayal of poor people supplementing their income by growing their own food is unfathomable he used the farm as a backdrop for his mayoral campaign he promised 5m to help purchase the farm he took over negotiations between horowitz and the annenberg foundation and he used the forever 21 money to advance his political agenda and his political future its a betrayal of the people of los angeles of the people from meso america the people who carried him into office

5698814 im delighted that the healthcare commission has agreed that addicts shouldnt be dumped and forgotten in towns like weston and that poor quality rehabs have to be stamped out because they arent fair on local residents or addicts either
5698815 westons drug problems are caused because too many organisations which send addicts for treatment in the town dont check whether theyre sending them to high quality rehabs or not

5698840 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5698841 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5698842 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

5698857 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players

5698871 we need to give young people positive alternatives to do too often they get into trouble because there is nothing for them to do the youth volunteer force will be a great way to get young people involved in activities that benefit themselves and the area where they live
5698872 i am also keen to ensure that those who do break the law or cause disturbances or vandalism have to pay back the community they have wronged
5698873 that is why restorative justice is important it will mean that those convicted of offences will have to work on cleaning up vandalism or on projects that benefit communities as part of their punishment it also helps young people better understand how they have affected their community
5698874 here in bath we are lucky to have seen work start on restorative justice both through the police and through the childrens society their work is very important and is beginning to yield positive results the communities they are working with are really seeing the benefit but we need to be able to spread these principles to more areas

5698885 el problema est en que la ley no alcanza a la mentalidad ni sensibilidad de algunos hombres que siguen actuando bajo relaciones de poder tratando a sus parejas como si fueran de su propiedad y esta situaci n la que hay que atajar
5698886 es necesario que la lucha contra la violencia de g nero sea una prioridad pol tica para que los violentos sientan el repudio de toda la sociedad

5698978 de islam is een vreedzame religie wie is het daarmee eens
5698979 ik moet steeds maar denken aan de bijbelse tekst dat vreemden het land zullen verteren
5698980 eigenlijk zijn we al te laat moskee n schieten de grond uit tegen onze cultuur in
5698981 ik denk dat veel nederlanders de term niet helemaal begrijpen
5698982 er moet een andere discussie zijn en niet n moskee zwartmaken
5698983 het is de plicht van iedere moslim die onder de invloed van een ongelovige vandaan wil komen om een vrome leider te kiezen
5698984 kan hij de strijd aangaan met alle middelen van woorden tot wapens
5698985 als je zon boek nu uitgeeft lever je er meer toelichting bij
5698986 we are excited to see the on screen chemistry and emotion this incredibly talented husband and wife team will bring to our show
5698987 fans are in for a treat and we couldnt be more thrilled that they chose er to make their first appearance together
5698988 ik verzoek den luisteraars om wanneer zij straks hun beddesteden opzoeken even rustig te gaan slapen als zij dat ook den anderen nachten doen er is voorshands geen enkele reden om werkelijk ongerust te zijn
5698989 wij verwerpen jullie maatschappij en willen ons afscheiden door ons anders te gedragen n ons anders te kleden
5698990 ik overdrijf niet in nederland voelde ik me vrij maar toen was het nog een plus om moslim te zijn het was interessant nu is moslim een scheldwoord en dat komt door de fundamentalisten die iedereen lastigvallen met hun radicale gedachtegoed ze misbruiken het geloof steniging eerwraak de koran als grondwet het heeft helemaal niets met het geloof te maken
5698991 ik vrees dat veel mensen mij zullen aanvallen zonder het boek gelezen te hebben er is al woedend gereageerd omdat ik zou waarschuwen voor alle islamieten maar het gaat mij om de islamisten zij die de islam degraderen tot een ideologie van afwijzing en wraaklust
5698992 bekeerlingen zijn vaak het fanatiekst en dat stemt mij droevig maar ik zie ook met afgrijzen dat steeds meer islamitische jongeren gevoelig blijken te zijn voor de propaganda van de islamisten ik hoop dat ze mijn boek lezen en tot inkeer komen
5698993 het is heel gevaarlijk als deze mensen het voor het zeggen krijgen in de moskee n en in de schoolgebouwen zij stellen de islam voor als een godsdienst die totalitair en agressief is en zich keert tegen alles wat het leven aangenaam maakt
5698994 de hand niet willen schudden van een vrouw bijvoorbeeld het is niet respectabel maar zeer discutabel de koning van marokko is de hoogste religieuze autoriteit van het land hij schudt de handen van alle vrouwen
5698995 toen ik een jongetje was in marokko droegen alleen oude vrouwen een hoofddoek en in tunesi een door en door moslimland is onlangs een verbod uitgevaardigd op hoofddoekjes in de openbare ruimte vrouwen die het toch doen mogen op straat worden aangehouden let wel we hebben het over tunesi waar in het eerste artikel van de grondwet staat dat het een moslimland is
5698996 tot geradicaliseerde jongeren zou ik willen zeggen jullie opvattingen getuigen van pure onwetendheid ga alsjeblieft eerst jarenlang studeren lees tienduizend boeken en vorm dan je mening
5698997 er is bijna geen land te bedenken waar je vrijer bent om je godsdienst te belijden er wordt vaak gezegd dat islamitische jongeren zich vervreemd voelen van de maatschappij dat ze nergens bij horen maar waarom moet dat leiden tot religieus fanatisme ook wordt aangevoerd dat discriminatie zon probleem is natuurlijk dat bestaat maar het is toch geen excuus om te radicaliseren je moet ermee leren leven
5698998 ik ken de koran uit mijn hoofd dus ik heb recht van spreken
5698999 bekend is dat moslims overspelige vrouwen moeten stenigen ik daag een ieder uit mij aan te wijzen waar de koran dit als regel meldt het staat namelijk nergens waar komt het dan vandaan welnu een van mijn vrome vrienden heeft mij uitgelegd dat het zou gaan om een koranvers dat verdwenen lijkt de koran is in de islam volmaakt en volledig tegelijkertijd dringen sommigen aan op steniging vanwege een vers dat erin heeft gestaan maar waarvan in diezelfde perfecte koran geen spoor meer is terug te vinden snapt u het snap ik het
5699000 deze schandalige uiting van geweld tegen vrouwen is opgenomen in de strafwetgeving van landen als jordani en pakistan maar het heeft geen enkele basis in de islam eerwraak is juist een pre islamitische misdaad de profeet mohammed veroordeelde asabiyya dat wil zeggen groepsgeest als zijnde in strijd met de geest van de islam
5699001 daar wordt telkens op gehamerd door de islamisten de koran moet dienen als een grondwet voor een islamitische staat maar de koran is daar helemaal niet geschikt voor de meeste mensen weten niet eens wat de sharia is zoals donner die onlangs riep dat invoering van de sharia moet kunnen als een meerderheid voor is de sharia bevat hoogstens een paar regels over erfrecht een jongen erft bijvoorbeeld het dubbele van zijn zus en er is maar n regel over economie god heeft de handel toegestaan en de woeker i verboden stel je voor dat we de sharia hebben dan zouden alle ambtenaren van economische zaken moeten werken met maar n i regel
5699002 in 1925 heeft de moslimtheoloog abderraziq reeds overtuigend aangetoond dat godsdienst en politiek gescheiden moeten blijven
5699003 in plaats daarvan worden hele volksstammen gemanipuleerd door de islamisten zo wordt vaak verwezen naar de beloning die martelaren wacht in het paradijs 70 of 72 maagden de hoeris met de grote ogen maar je zou het betreffende vers uit de koran ook anders kunnen lezen dan staat er opeens dat het gaat om druiven zo helder als kristal en verder dat er allerlei soorten reine vruchten zij in de tuinen van het paradijs in plaats van gelouterde vrouwen dan denk ik waar blazen die godsdienstfanaten zich voor op je denkt in een te gek vrouwenverblijf te belanden en je treft er moeder teresa die een banaan zit op te peuzelen
5699004 toen het westen nog in onwetendheid verkeerde werd de islam gekenmerkt door nieuwsgierigheid verdraagzaamheid en intellectuele vrijheid
5699005 de inkt van een geleerde is waardevoller dan het bloed van een martelaar
5699006 ik waarschuw jullie voor godsdienstig extremisme want het heeft de ondergang veroorzaakt van de volken die jullie zijn voorafgegaan
5699007 ik kan nog wel honderd andere voorbeelden geven met dezelfde strekking en al die jonge moslims die nu zo de weg kwijt zijn zou ik dan willen vragen als je hoort wat de profeet zei hoe kun je dan nog extremistisch zijn
5699008 de eerste druppel was de uitspraak van minister van ardenne in jemen een halfjaar geleden zij vond dat seculiere opiniemakers ze had het zelfs over fundamentalistische seculieren gevaarlijk bezig waren door achter een fa ade van tolerantie vijandigheid jegens andere culturen en religies te betonen dat vonden wij z idioot dat we wat op papier wilden zetten er heerst steeds meer een sfeer dat je het over bepaalde zaken niet meer mag hebben de nadruk in het debat is steeds meer komen te liggen op het recht om te beledigen in plaats van op het recht van vrijheid van meningsuiting

5699010 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5699011 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5699012 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5699013 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5699014 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5699015 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5699016 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5699017 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5699018 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5699019 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5699020 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5699021 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5699022 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5699023 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5699024 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5699025 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5699026 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5699027 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5699028 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5699029 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5699030 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5699031 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5699032 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5699039 le he dicho a mi mujer que he sufrido un mont n en esta carrera
5699040 esta era la ltima prueba de mi carrera puede que alg n d a me lo piense pero en principio es el final
5699041 estamos muy contentos ha sido una carrera dif cil sobre todo a la mitad
5699042 hemos tenido que luchar mucho para ganar una vuelta y al final lo conseguimos s lo tuvimos dos meses para prepararnos antes de la carrera
5699043 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5699044 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5699045 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5699046 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5699047 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5699048 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5699049 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5699050 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5699051 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5699052 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5699053 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5699054 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5699056 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5699057 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5699058 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5699059 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5699060 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5699061 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5699062 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5699063 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5699064 ih llande bombardemang i ett omr de dit m nga internflyktingar s kt sig har tvingat dem att ter f rflytta sig l ngre in i kilinochchi
5699065 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5699066 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5699067 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5699068 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5699069 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5699070 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5699071 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5699072 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5699073 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5699074 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5699075 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5699076 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5699077 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5699078 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5699079 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5699080 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5699081 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5699082 unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the
5699083 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet seldom carried out by those who are able
5699084 where are the men why do i have to be the one standing up here and doing this work
5699085 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5699086 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country just imagine it and us reaping the reward of everyone who accepts islam through this movement through years to come think and plan big may allah give this strength and sincerity to us so that our humble effort continue and expands until america becomes a muslim land
5699087 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language
5699088 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
5699089 how many people in this room own more than one pair of boots

5699091 this is a woman who attempted to blast her way out of captivity
5699092 it was her decision as she refused to by seen by a male doctor
5699093 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5699125 die basis ist f r mich das 4 4 2 system wichtig ist eine kompaktheit herzustellen wie es spanien so eindr cklich an der em demonstriert hat unser spiel muss unberechenbarer werden
5699126 ich wei dass die erwartungen sehr hoch sind die qualifikation wird kein selbstl ufer sondern ist mit harter arbeit verbunden ich bin es gewohnt mit solchem druck umzugehen wichtig ist dass alle nicht nur die spieler sondern auch der stab alles dem ziel 2010 unterordnen
5699127 das stellt auch f r mich eine spezielle und spannende situation dar es ist ein neuer lebensabschnitt und ich sp re eine leichte innere anspannung es ist gut dass es nun losgeht

5699135 truth is everybody will play quarterback this year pep hamilton suits up nov 2 because the bears offensive line is expected to be brought up on manslaughter charges
5699136 this is the real problem i mean grossman was flagged for intentional grounding on a play run out of shotgun formation out of shotgun formation
5699137 mostly what osullivan did was perform as though he regarded the job as his the most important requirement of all
5699138 the 49ers have not had that sense from their quarterback since jeff garcia s departure their defensive issues have been obvious enough over the last five years but the offense has been more egregiously substandard they are the only team in the nfl not to have at least one 300 point season in the last four years and while there are plenty of reasons for that we all know where it starts because it is the first place anyone looks when this team is losing

5699142 frankly im a little disappointed i was hoping usain bolt would showboat a little more at the end of the 100 meters you know drop a leslie nielsen move from naked gun and moonwalk the last 10 meters or perform a little michael flatley riverdance routine

5699144 the network offered more hours than had been shown in all previous summer olympics combined and yet during the first week only three people were ever seen in prime time michael phelps and the beach volleyball players misty may treanor and kerri walsh stories about dara torres the quadragenarian swimmer and mother of a toddler abounded before the games but petered out once phelpsmania began in the four years since i was last forced to watch beach volleyball i somehow have not found the maturity and wisdom to take it seriously as an olympic sport and frankly i doubt that nbc takes it seriously either except as a ratings grabber every time i turned on the tv there was may treanor the short one and walsh the tall one in those silly little victorias ill kept secret outfits

5699260 my daddy is a preacher and i am a nice guy that covers my ear with my hat
5699261 for us to pretend that things arent happening on the street would be putting blinders on
5699262 we have to get the community re engaged in the lives of young people
5699263 you need to have strong community cohesion you need to have recreational programs or community agencies that are actively dealing with these youth
5699264 what we know is that neighbourhoods that have a lot of community programs tend to do better in terms of preventing gang violence and gangs from emerging in the first place
5699265 theres lower commitment to the gang theyre still in the early stages and theres a romanticized view they like the idea of being a gang member
5699266 it really is a myth to believe that its simply this or simply that
5699267 what kind of people have sex again and again on the internet

5699275 the bible says to turn the other cheek ms lavictoire shes an old lady now and it would be the right thing to do
5699276 well what would you guys say if i reminded you that the people they killed were for the most part in their 20s and 30s and never had a chance to get old like atkins why should she get a break in her sentence when they are still dead because of her actions
5699277 what about sharon tates baby he never even had a chance to be born and he was supposed to be born the following week he would be in his late 30s now and maybe even a dad himself if he had had a chance to live do you think it is justice to let her out of prison now
5699278 what would you guys say if i told you that atkins has received over 1 million dollars worth of medical care if you guys moved to california and got sick you wouldnt be able to get the care she has received especially if you were uninsured is that fair
5699279 guys this feels funny because the crime itself was so gruesome so horrifying and so unnecessary its terrible to think about what those victims were thinking and feeling in the last moments of their life its sad to think that a baby was never born but its also so sad to think that this woman susan atkins who was so young herself at the time has wasted all the potential and time she had living in prison because of her bad choices you guys feel bad because now she is a sick old lady and this might be her last chance at any semblance of a normal life you feel compassion and thats good you guys are good people but any compassion given to her now is not going to change the wasted time and the lost lives and in some way her paying off the debt with her full lifetime in prison totally supported by and humanely cared for by the state of california adds a little balance it says that a life taken is worth a lifetime given does that make any sense

5699297 they are not harmed in any way and the trip is 4 days away lets not make this out to be something more than it is
5699298 i was under the mistaken university educated opinion that a childs first years were the most formative and that the bonding process is at its most crucial during that time
5699299 sure it matters ive had some massive members in my time and i really enjoyed them i find that the bigger the penis the greater the feeling
5699300 i once slept with a guy who had a stub for a cock and i couldnt feel anything i ended up going into the bathroom and satisfying myself a situation i dont care to repeat
5699301 i would rather sleep with a guy who has a thick member than someone with a thin reedy schlong that hits my cervix every time he penetrates me
5699302 ive noticed that african americans are really well endowed as compared to other nationalities they also seem to be much more confident in bed knowing that they have the right size package
5699303 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
5699304 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5699305 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5699306 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious political risk
5699307 it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5699308 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5699309 our troops have performed magnificently and violence is genuinely down
5699310 but listen if you drive a bus into a ditch and then after five years and a trillion dollars and 4 000 lives lost you are getting the bus halfway out of the ditch it doesnt mean you made a good decision driving the bus off the road in the first place
5699311 i know democrats have not been that successful in presidential elections over the last few cycles
5699312 and so everywhere i go people tell me oh im getting nervous republicans are so mean theyre going to swift boat you theyre going to be doing things to you what are we going to do
5699313 and i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics the same guys who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is try to attack me
5699314 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5699315 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5699316 the russians have closed access to gori and we have no way of getting back
5699317 gave us some excuse for why she wouldnt let us through and insisted that we go to the back of the line there were some 700 people on line
5699318 we were sure that everyone had left and that we were the only jews left in town
5699319 even the trash collection and mail deliveries are functioning on normal schedule
5699320 but they told her to come back on monday for visas
5699321 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
5699322 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
5699323 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment
5699324 for mccain not only does it patriotism arise from his very being his identity but it plays a dual role of emphasizing a national security part of the campaign and the contrast between him and obama
5699325 hes going to demonstrate love of country by word and deed at the convention
5699326 its not something that you repeat i am patriot there are no specific patriotic activities its got to come across at an authentic and sincere way
5699327 conservative whites look at them blacks as unpatriotic and yet if you look at the constitution and the history the black community has been trying to make that constitution work for everybody
5699328 he has been in combat and i have been in combat but just because he is a running for office doesnt mean he has the right to run the country
5699329 but this issue will have to be taken into view
5699330 would you look at the state of these t shirts
5699331 what have you done it looks like a wild animal ran amok in here
5699332 thats it thats what the cry of pain was about
5699333 that some foul crime had been committed that maybe last night i got really drunk and daubed shit all over the walls and then forgot about it but no i displaced a couple of t shirts
5699334 i bet the noise of the traffic drives you nuts
5699335 and there was me thinking you bought the place for the woodland
5699336 its easier to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission
5699337 all of the drilling activities in houston are very high
5699338 theres a high demand for the pipe and up to now we were not able to meet the high demand
5699339 last year we saw that the oil exploration in canada decreased 40 percent and we found that the business is risky
5699340 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5699341 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5699342 i would expect going forward that the weakness of domestic demand should contain prices especially of durable goods consumers are not likely to make very large ticket purchases when prospects in the labor market are weakening
5699343 but clearly there is a big more resilience in the prices than we thought and i think this is reflecting a pass through from the strength we had seen in commodity prices and prices went up for producers and even if demand weakens they have to pass some of those increases along
5699344 i think most people were bracing for that headline number to be bad because of the cpi number last week
5699345 theres nothing good about it inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5699346 were clearly not out of the woods yet if we continue to see jobless around 450 000 its going to make people very nervous about rolling into a recession
5699347 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows the market is struggling a bit were walking a tight rope and were just marking time were in a base building process and i dont think we need to take out the low that we saw recently
5699348 this further really confirms what the cpi showed last week that inflation is higher than expected and probably higher than the fed would like to see the hope with the ppi was that maybe it was going to come down a little bit given the lower energy prices but this higher than expected number confirms that inflation is going to continue to be a concern for the fed going forward here
5699349 the core ppi reading jumping half a percent above expectations is pretty startling it certainly highlights the inflationary pressures its going to see u s rates treasury yields move higher and this is going to lend the dollar a little bit more interest rate support
5699350 similarly to the bond markets reaction to the cpi because of what has happened to commodity prices and energy prices in the last month there is some discounting of that ppi reading as maybe a one off treasuries are also looking over to the stock market and responding to the weakness there
5699351 overall it seems to be a bit uneventful what you have is a very weak housing starts number coupled with a very high ppi number and i think the market is trying to digest that the ppi number is troubling and inflation seems to be a problem that just does not seem to want to go away
5699352 it can be seen as a payback in june from the building code change in new york city we may see another decline in august the underlying trend is still downward the fundamentals in housing are still poor
5699353 while the headline is double the consensus its really the core the most surprising it looks like motor vehicle prices were much stronger than expected given the soft sales the large jump in motor vehicle prices could not be sustained
5699354 there is evidence of pass through of wholesale prices to retail but manufacturers are being squeezed for their cost of inputs without much success in passing them through to customers that squeeze will likely continue

5699457 in recent months hutto has helped scale back a rule proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to protect north atlantic right whales one of the most endangered animals on the planet from lethal ship strikes
5699458 burnett said that this year hutto opposed tightening federal rules for smog forming ozone which is linked to thousands of premature deaths each year and in 2005 he questioned why the epa needed to limit mercury emissions from power plants because the agency had just issued a rule that would have the incidental effect of somewhat reducing the toxic pollutant
5699459 what we said earlier this year still applies now that there continues to be little transactional investment evidence in the general commercial and relevant to our specific industrial property markets
5699460 the apocalyptic opening lines of bob dylans all along the watchtower seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market
5699461 there is no real depth of evidence of willing buyers and sellers the rics valuation standards assumption financing remains difficult and sellers are reluctant to crystallise lower prices
5699462 if the thieves are the funded or equity based opportunist buyers and the jokers are the owners who wont sell there is no way out of this impasse yet

5699464 miracle fruits sometimes called miracle berries have been a secret wonder of the world for centuries though they were first documented by a french dude in 1725 theyd been consumed for many generations prior they were eaten before meals to make the meals taste better how you ask by making sour and bitter foods taste sweet but how you scream the truth is science doesnt completely know it has something to do with the protein miraculin that bonds to your taste buds but the exact cause is still a mystery but the berries work and its a miracle now you know we wouldnt sell you something without trying it first so we did limes suddenly tasted like the sweetest most perfect limeade ever oranges already quite sweet tasted like they were imported from an alien world or plucked straight from the garden of eden truly words cant describe the life altering sensations caused by these little tablets snozzberries in our wallpaper tasted like ok they were just boogers tip to self dont lick wallpaper but seriously these little things are incredible you can join the new craze of hosting flavor tripping parties everyone gets a dose of miracle berry and then you taste things you can even help your diet with miracle berry fruit tablets healthy yucky foods will taste like candy and you wont crave sugar laden i e fattening candy anymore see its a miracle

5699467 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5699468 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5699469 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5699474 is a small wonder a kind of wooden pier stretching over land when the doors of the turrets concealing its telescopes glide open it looks like a childs drawing of a warship with its decks and galley its largely timber and steel construction and great views out across the waters of kielder forest the observatory really does feel like a ship at sea especially as night settles in and only the ghostly shrieks of barn owls remind you that you are a long way from tidal waters
5699475 barclays observatory is a happy balance between what appears to be little more than a simple almost cartoon like timber gangway with some sheds on top and some fine technology inside with the cranks and cogs needed for the telescope turrets sitting delightfully within the simple wooden walls floors and ceilings it is rather like being in an early victorian steamship especially in the dark when the red lamps glow red keeps light pollution to a minimum
5699476 britains border security is now amongst the toughest in the world
5699477 the new facial recognition gates undertake checks against security watch lists in the same way as a current manual controls
5699478 the trial will tell us whether these gates can maintain the high level of entry security we have introduced into the uk
5699479 our high tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5699480 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
5699481 the british public rightly expects our borders to protect the national interests tackling immigration crime smuggling and tax fraud

5699490 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5699491 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5699492 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5699493 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5699494 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5699495 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5699496 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5699497 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as caffeine
5699498 kids as well as adults need to be allowed to sleep enough
5699499 we say eight hours of sleep a night but it takes an hour to wind down its very very hard to allow enough time to sleep
5699500 wir haben uns mit dem spieler geeinigt und eine zusage seines clubs

5699504 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5699505 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5699506 these are increases after a long period of stability in the auto market
5699507 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than upward pressure from low prices in the past
5699508 its going to take some time to see what impact its going to have
5699509 short term there are things drivers can be doing if the rise in gas prices has significantly decreased the amount of time you spend behind the wheel you should call your insurer that can help you manage your rates as an individual
5699510 its unfortunate that allstate and state farm are choosing to raise rates at a time when most texans are struggling with high gas food and housing prices

5699518 its just something people are not going to stand for i believe its something thats wrong
5699519 they came to our church to express their feelings about what happened
5699520 we need to keep prayer for anyone who has those hateful thoughts in their hearts
5699521 we are working on some bugs which affect around 2 of the iphones shipped and hope to have a software update soon

5699525 i think it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum rudd said today in auckland
5699526 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer to the commitments which have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states that is now not going to occur
5699527 we dont believe we can sit idly by while the principles of democracy are shredded and therefore the resolve of pacific island counties is to act in concert on this question he said
5699528 in our consultations with our fellow heads of government from the pacific island countries we are confronted front and centre with the impact of climate change on regional states rudd said

5699530 they have cleaned the bin and placed a mattress in it
5699531 the bin was always neat and tidy and the bed is usually made perfectly
5699532 at first we thought the kids were just playing in the bin but they are there during the day
5699533 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it maitland police inspector trevor shiels said
5699534 when police investigated they found a few bedding items and living items its a bit hard to draw a conclusion
5699535 concerns remain that the children were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for the winter weather and were without any adult supervision a docs statement said
5699536 i think its very healthy the fact that other guys are doing it lee said

5699545 victoria police proposes snr const moores experience and that of mr vorchheimer and his family be incorporated into training utilised in developing and training its people deputy commissioner simon overland said
5699546 such conduct can only be described as disgraceful and should not be tolerated in our community against anyone mr overland said
5699547 victoria police is of the view that snr const moore made an error of judgment and did not act in a positive manner to intervene at the earliest opportunity
5699548 looking at the bigger picture we believe the outcome supports our endeavours for the betterment of the community mr vorchheimer said
5699549 we want to reverse certain things that are not right in our community

5699775 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5699776 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording

5699803 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5699804 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5699805 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5699806 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5699807 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5699808 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5699809 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5699810 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5699811 this is a planning took where all things are going
5699812 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5699813 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5699814 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5699815 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5699816 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5699817 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5699818 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5699819 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5699820 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5699821 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5699822 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5699823 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5699824 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5699825 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5699826 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5699827 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5699828 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5699829 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5699830 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5699831 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5699832 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5699833 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5699834 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5699835 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5699836 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5699837 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5699838 strong focus will be given to maximum black economic empowerment participation
5699839 hey listen id really like to set that broken arm of yours but you had sex with tom over there and youre a dude so i figure repairing this compound fracture of yours violates something in leviticus about working on the sabbath or coveting they neighbor or something something so youre dick out of luck try atheist medical and come back when youve got a real christian illness like lepercy
5699840 dont mind that womans bloody uterus i found jesus halfway thru the salpingo oophorectomy and decided i shouldnt assist such a uteroabortive procedure
5699841 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5699842 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5699843 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5699844 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5699845 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5699846 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5699847 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5699848 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5699849 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5699850 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5699851 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5699852 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5699853 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5699854 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5699855 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5699856 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5699857 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5699858 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5699859 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5699860 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5699861 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5699862 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5699863 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5699864 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5699865 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5699866 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5699867 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5699868 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5699869 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5699870 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5699871 no he corrido bien a pie no he tenido el d a he tenido problemas estomacales no he digerido bien el gel que tom en la bici y adem s el tend n de aquiles me ha estado dando la lata llevo dos meses que tengo molestias

5699873 ha habido tres que han sido m s r pidos que yo y s lo queda felicitarlos
5699874 es peor quedar el 25 que el cuarto aunque lo importante son las medallas pero el deporte es as no son matem ticas
5699875 en los juegos si en vez de estar al cien por cien est s al 97 te ganan
5699876 no llevaba nada pero lo intent porque vi que whitfield se quedaba pero al final ha vuelto a entrar en el grupo y no he podido hacer nada
5699877 lo que pasa es que el sabor que te queda de la dureza es mejor si ganas el oro

5699879 hemos tenido dos atletas en los puestos cuarto y quinto no puedo quejarme han estado en la carrera y han dado un buen espect culo

5699882 ser el triatleta del pr ximo ciclo ol mpico volver a ganar es muy seguro gana el 90 por ciento de las carreras aunque con calor algo menos
5699883 led by james b peake issued a directive that bans nonpartisan voter registration drives at federally financed nursing homes rehabilitation centers and shelters for homeless veterans
5699884 wilson comes to a bigger broader realization that house is possibly a destructive force in his life house isnt good for him and as a result of that realization wilson decides to up sticks and leave
5699885 house is so needy so desperate so curious so unable to leave well enough alone that he actually takes the frankly unusual step of hiring a private investigator to see how wilson is faring on his own who hes seeing who hes with is he happy is he not happy its an obsessive and frankly narcotic act but its a step he takes
5699886 we spent a lot of time together one on one while i was there
5699887 he didnt really socialize a lot at first but i made a real effort to include him in the activities we did and as a result he really opened up to me
5699888 the group of us were heading down to the ledge a local swimming spot for a swim and i was carrying josh on my back because his feet were sore
5699889 this was the point in time where he really opened up to me and seeing as how he was on my back we bonded both physically and emotionally
5699890 josh just has this tendency to make you feel good
5699891 he has that effect on everyone if were walking or sitting down somewhere to eat every second person says hi to josh
5699892 i believe that the summer games tryouts in port aux basques was the first time he had ever swam in a race before
5699893 he is a huge part of my life and he gives me a great sense of pride
5699894 we have a few forms to fill out and are still discussing the particulars of it with stephenville but it should be quite successful
5699895 i suggest we write a letter to the rcmp informing them to really crack down on speeders in that area
5699896 the speed limit on that route is 50 not 60
5699897 a lot of planning went into it and it was great to see everyone out there everyone who attended made it a great success
5699898 were also very concerned about the beautification of the area
5699899 were having terrible problems getting the brush cleared away from the sides of the roads also the roads are beginning to become littered with garbage we advise the residents of the town to keep their area clean
5699900 weve received plenty of letters from residents who love it
5699901 i drive by there frequently and i always see someone using it
5699902 its really unfortunate that this is going on right now because we just finished ten glorious days for our 50th anniversary
5699903 everything went so well so many people came home and they were so happy to see people see our town still being in such good shape thank goodness nothing went on when they were here
5699904 this just give the town such a hard name and you know weve got a beautiful little community there
5699905 they need a pool of employees and identifying that pool of employees is i guess something we havent had to deal with in the recent past but potentially it can be a real barrier to getting set up
5699906 part of the problem with this one ad is where its anonymous theres a little bit of lack of credibility associated with it
5699907 the feedback ive gotten from different people is they dont believe this is actually real
5699908 the thing now is moving up to where the human resources aspect has got to be proven
5699909 people can see the airport infrastructure they can see the millsite they can see the scenery they can see the houses and schools and those sort of things but now this is another thing where its a bit more complicated
5699910 one of my fears in terms of our development committee is that if a deal like this cant be done because of human resources barriers thats going to have to be addressed in any strategic planning for the future and its going to be an issue then
5699911 only a few years ago especially when the mill shut down we thought that employment was going to be our number one priority
5699912 and obviously it still is but finding enough people to satisfy business needs ongoing or for expansion of new businesses is not guaranteed right now
5699913 thats the whole problem now we need a sort of a real human resources recruitment type system in place for these type of companies
5699914 he wanted to change his working conditions but the town did not want to meet these changes
5699915 he was under a 90 day contract with us and after those 90 days he had the right to opt out of his position
5699916 the public was hard on him but in all fairness the man was doing his job we had a lot of people refuse to pay for the tickets he handed out but i mean if you dont want a ticket dont park in the no parking spaces
5699917 the job is very necessary to enforce the rules of parking in town
5699918 youve got your young guys in their sports cars who park in these spaces and if you were to walk by and ask what about the handicapped who use these spaces theyd tell you where to go weve had instances of this and its just not right
5699919 people getting upset about getting a ticket is a natural thing to expect
5699920 the council has been informed of his departure and as far as replacements go it is an ongoing decision
5699921 nothing has been done as of yet but it may be an issue that is presented at the next council meeting

5699930 a new administration is around the corner but peake has thrust himself into a difficult job and the evidence indicates that he is fully engaged

5699935 sleep and wakefulness issues were the most common health problems described by recently returned soldiers researchers at walter reed army medical center found in a study published last year
5699936 studies have shown that sleeping problems are much more common in combat veterans than in other young adults
5699937 is sure to become a national model for providing educational opportunities
5699938 is based upon the same concept as stand downs a one stop center offering services for all veterans
5699939 the va is overwhelmed as well as the military bases are overwhelmed with returning veterans who are seeking mental health services at a greater rate than they have ever seen before

5699957 indias number one davis cupper leander paes informed anil khanna executive vice president and secretary general in a meeting held in beijing just after the tennis event that he would like to step down as captain of the indian davis cup team for the tie against romania
5699958 he wanted the best davis cup team to represent the nation and did not want to leave any doubt in anyones mind for their non participation to represent the country in the biggest team event
5699959 somdev has been picked on the basis of his recent performance leander and mahesh being our best doubles players picked themselves into the squad but rohan has not been selected because prakash and somdev are in better form and are ranked higher than him
5699960 of course rohan is more experienced but somdev is in great form and we thought he would be a better choice current form and performance were the only criteria while selecting the team

5699969 from the american point of view we wildly mis estimated him and we wildly mis estimated pakistani capabilities
5699970 once the government gets this behind them maybe they can focus on counter terrorism and get back to the business of governing
5699971 the civilian government is pretty divided in how it views relations with the united states
5699972 musharraf for all his flaws was seen as somebody able to manage washingtons demands in pakistan the civilian leadership is seen as all too willing to make concessions to washington including some that in the eyes of the security establishment are untenable
5699973 i just dont think that one person especially given the condition he has been operating in for some time makes that much difference
5699974 that is an opportunity not a liability but it comes at a difficult time
5699975 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal areas by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants

5699985 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp stay silent only when telling the truth might get us fired or earn us a broken nose we need moral courage to be honest all the time

5699988 will be pressed as the only answer to ecological problems and will be one more influence in the wests becoming increasingly eastern in its thinking
5699989 the only reason we are called upon to treat nature well is because of its effects on man and our children and the generations to come so in reality man is left with a completely egoistic position in regard to nature
5699990 having no absolutes modern man has no categories one cannot have real answers without categories and these men can have no categories beyond pragmatic technological ones
5699991 a pantheistic stand always brings man to an impersonal and low place rather than elevating him
5699992 so the christian treats things with integrity because we do not believe they are autonomous modern man has fallen into a dilemma because he has made things autonomous from god
5699993 we should be looking now on the basis of the work of christ for substantial healing in every area affected by the fall
5699994 by creation man has dominion but as a fallen creature he has used that dominion wrongly because he is fallen he exploits created things as thought they were nothing in themselves and as though he has an autonomous right to them
5699995 we must confess that we missed our opportunity we have spoken loudly against materialistic science but we have done little to show that in practice we ourselves as christians are not dominated by a technological orientation in regard either to man or nature
5699996 if we treat nature as having no intrinsic value our own value is diminished
5699997 this is a very serious offence a custodial sentence is the only option
