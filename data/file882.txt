8820257 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8820258 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore
8820259 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8820260 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8820261 this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8820262 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8820263 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8820264 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8820265 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8820266 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8820267 i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8820268 would be very pleased and proud of what the democratic party and our nation is on the brink of doing
8820269 i feel that he and my mother are looking down today with a great big smile on their faces
8820270 one of those moments where no matter how you assess it america is moving far from where its ever been
8820271 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8820272 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8820273 put middle class americans first again and reward companies who create jobs in america instead of shipping them overseas
8820274 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8820275 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8820276 the types recognized by ner are any sets of words that intersect with an ner type

8820278 i was at home one night up really late in my basement i knew everyone in my house was asleep but i thought i heard walking upstairs when i went up to check i could have sworn i saw someone sitting on the couch
8820279 it includes works on paranormal phenomena werewolves the possibility for occult powers witchcraft astrology and 19th century spiritualism
8820280 a lot of people use the items in the collection for fun but they can be invaluable for people serious about the occult sciences
8820281 the exhibit is helpful for scholars who want to study what people were thinking at a particular time
8820282 it adds a different perspective and showcases a collection that not many people know the library has
8820283 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8820284 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8820285 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8820286 as percep es dos homens sobre a masculinidade diferem de maneira significativa dos estere tipos da literatura

8820289 if a business decides not to cooperate that does not in itself support or require the filing of criminal charges in any way
8820290 this is what weve been working towards for so long now
8820291 its been such an amazing experience to be part of this campaign
8820292 this is one step closer to bringing about real change
8820293 he puts so much hope into these students and its because he has a really great plan for this country
8820294 i think he laid out a lot of his policies really well
8820295 i really believe hes the right candidate for this new era
8820296 it gives all schools in the state a goal which needs to be reached
8820297 its not just university police working to keep pedestrians safe its also housing and construction project managers
8820298 well be actively stopping pedestrians when we see a violation of the law
8820299 students should not be walking on the street or bike path along gregory drive
8820300 the last thing you want to do is make a truck choose between you and the fence
8820301 we look for very high achieving and high ability individuals who come from diverse backgrounds
8820302 the excellence of the institution is a critical factor in attracting more excellence
8820303 i just hope im able to get students excited and motivated about learning course content and succeeding at the u of i
8820304 i like the atmosphere here which is more conducive to research and training
8820305 my goals are to merge my teaching and research together to help students
8820306 i think its a great its going to be a great bowl game type atmosphere against one of our rivals
8820307 were excited about it the only thing you have to be good fast
8820308 theres no warm up here not that there are any warm up games but were playing a very high level team early and our goal is to try to play our best game
8820309 its not going to make or break a team for a whole season
8820310 but its going to be one of those games that people remember for a long time because you have a stage
8820311 it would be really big for illini nation period for us to come out and beat missouri
8820312 were always going to be the underdog until we prove something
8820313 i grew up watching that game and its great to be a part of that
8820314 theyre like shades to hide the sun if theres a deep ball in the sky
8820315 its so hard to get pass blocking right because you have to get everything just right to cover all your bases
8820316 he says hes going to stay in and sometimes hell leave anyway
8820317 oh yeah i plan at least at least two sacks this game
8820318 like first week into camp got a little bored on the day off i guess
8820319 its just kind of stuck because you get a little lazy now focusing in on football
8820320 just meetings all day eating camp rantoul stuff like that its focus in time but ill admit i was up until 3 a m last night
8820321 i was trying to pretend i was watching movies but i was just thinking about the game what could be the implications it could have on our season were not putting all our eggs in one basket but we definitely want this game
8820322 i couldnt hear the guard next to me martin odonnell was screaming in my ear and i could not hear a word he was saying
8820323 i went in with the mind set that i wanted to be in it and wanted to be close with a chance to win at the end
8820324 there were a lot of great players there many great players from chicago so you never know what to expect but you just have to go in and take care of your own business and hope you can be there in the end
8820325 i had a hard chip an 81 yard shot over the water
8820326 you go back to what you were trained to do and what youve been doing for 20 years i just had to handle the present and make a good shot realizing that i still had a cushion if that had been a bad shot all heck wouldve broken loose so i just had to regroup and connect the pieces to hit a solid third shot
8820327 going into the season my expectation are for us to make the next step for us to be one of the best programs in the nation
8820328 our goal as a team is to try to be a trophy team which would be top four
8820329 going into this race im looking to see where people are at with their summer training
8820330 this is a great opportunity too for the girls to make strides to the next step which would be being able to run in some of the bigger meets
8820331 we want to become a program that is consistently battling to go to the ncaa championships as a team
8820332 since ive been here weve had individuals in nationals now we want to see the end result and see a team in place to qualify for ncaa championships
8820333 my goal this season is to finish strong at the end of the season in the past i usually falter off towards the end
8820334 were geared up for it i think it is good preparation for the big ten
8820335 if you start out with an easy schedule youre not preparing for the matches youre going to be playing later in the season were the underdog and we always love being the underdogs because no one really expects anything
8820336 any students who show up are going to have a blast
8820337 this gym when it is packed with several thousand students its crazy
8820338 and it is the teams chance to connect especially the freshman class its their chance to connect with the band and the athletic events and learn all the fun traditions that go on here
8820339 the books title refers to the fact that the words pigeon and dove were once used interchangeably
8820340 rats are really smart and fascinating animals these judgments we make about pests are all about context pigeons annoy people because theyre not easily controlled and we love to be able to control our environment it doesnt mean theyre inherently bad or unworthy of appreciation
8820341 most feral pigeons live only a year or two domestic pigeons can live into their
8820342 pigeons wont fly at night their night vision is worse than that of humans

8820353 i think he won the night from the very first moment
8820354 if youre a republican operative a close adviser to president bush youre hoping that last night john kerry lays an egg
8820355 think about that for a moment african american families across america mothers and fathers and sons and daughters watching their television screens as for the first time in our unions history a black man will stand onstage and accept that nomination and all those mothers and fathers can say to their children look you can do that some day too so put aside politics for a moment and consider no matter who wins this election no matter where your allegiances lie barack obama is about to take a step forward not only for african americans but for all americans
8820356 i was looking at him talking about the economy how many times have i heard this same speech from liberal democrats over 20 years not just at this convention
8820357 ive been reading speeches all my life but nothing like this and let me tell you what was great about it what it is is a military practice and its called attacking from a defensive position
8820358 its how henry won at agincourt its how alexander won its how reagan kicked carters butt and what you do is this you take your opponent s best shot and you throw it back on him
8820359 theres a wee baby moon lying flat upon its back with its tiny little toes up in the air and its all by itself in the wide blue sky but the tiny little moon doesnt care
8820360 theres no place like home theres no place like home theres no place like home
8820361 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8820363 god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble
8820364 im quite shocked and annoyed to see what the government is doing

8820367 denver with the candidate she wanted but reportedly without her eyelashes
8820368 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8820369 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8820370 i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors
8820371 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8820372 denver with the candidate she wanted but reportedly without her eyelashes
8820373 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8820374 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8820375 i am also a believer in the freedom of speech including speech that i might not like
8820376 denver with the candidate she wanted but reportedly without her eyelashes
8820377 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8820378 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8820379 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
8820380 we do deliver a lot of our own freight simply because this saves our customers money
8820381 implications of many clauses in the bill have not been thought through
8820382 to an accused he will always question the integrity of the investigator who is seeking conviction and the one in charge of storing evidence is the same party
8820383 its not about which party you are from you must go with your conscience the bill has a lot of loopholes and they dont just apply to members of the oppositionbut to everyone
8820384 se han convertido en un faro continental de la cultura
8820385 que se diga que una universidad no debe intervenir en actividades no prioritarias como si la difusi n cultural no fuese un espacio acad mico determinante para la divulgaci n de las ideas y las obras libremente concebidas con argumentos similares la cultura del pa s cada vez tiene menos apoyos para su fomento y desarrollo continuando con la perversa intenci n de desaparecer las escuelas de cine y la industria cinematogr fica nacional extinguir las editoriales librer as y lectores y convertir nuestras pantallas cinematogr ficas en el escaparate nico de materiales extranjeros por s lo hablar de estos dos campos
8820386 that was the beginning of the most important changes before that everything was literal a direct representation of the battlefield with no way of abstractly representing behaviors
8820387 creating the foundations of mathematically driven warfare that would be programmed on computers in the 1950s
8820388 the rand corporation was working on a system to present theater level warfare in a form that would allow more mathematically accurate actions than those found on sand tables and board games of earlier centuries
8820389 thus was born the lasting tension between games as serious military tools and games as a form of entertainment
8820390 the players could focus on the tactical movements and leave the complexity of manipulation to the computer
8820391 incorporate mathematic and logical algorithms that were far beyond what could be managed with a human driven paper game
8820392 we are much more comfortable with using entertainment technologies for military training today
8820393 it was primitive but they showed the big idea of using games for training
8820394 as games have become more sophisticated and as the military has come to understand them better we have been able to identify better means of leveraging these technologies for serious purposes
8820395 we have come a long way in how we use games every year somebody takes it a stop further
8820396 soldiers are putting these cots games into their own hands and modifying them for their specific needs
8820397 we bring the system out to the field and create a gaming lab with a networking center
8820398 the soldiers just dive in and start playing the scenarios
8820399 then they start adapting those scenarios to make them more realistic they are not only learning the given scenarios but teaching themselves to replicate real life experiences to re live and recreate what theyve seen on their own missions
8820400 biz onu daha iyi biliriz onun dedikleri seyin hak ve gercek oldugunu bilseydik kendisine tabi
8820401 dediler aralarindan birtakim akilsiz beyinsiz ve k leleri kiskirtarak turlu hakaret ettiler bir takiminida peygamberimizin
8820402 kim kabristana ugrar ve orada on bir ihlas i serif okuyup sevabini lulere hediye ederse kendisine luler adedince sevap verilir
8820403 and were already starting the planning to reset the scenarios and the opfor opposing force so that we can do that
8820404 and so they know how to fight and right now were focused on irregular warfare and a lot of the skills that they have are directly transferable to major conventional operations
8820405 we wont flinch on making sure that our soldiers have the best possible training and equipment to succeed in whatever war we send them into and thats whats happening here every day
8820406 it is very clear to us that the families are stretched
8820407 that the whole force is stretched theres no denying that what were asking of our families is far different than anything that i have seen in my career up to now
8820408 and i think while the next two years will continue to be hard
8820409 and i must admit when i walked down the street the first time the hair stood up on the back of my neck because it was so real
8820410 weve made a quantum advance just in the year plus since ive been here
8820411 from peacetime engagements to major conventional operations and every place in between
8820412 that will allow us to build more brigades which means with more brigades the ones that we have go are deployed less
8820413 and were changing basically what was a cold war army before september 11th to a versatile disciplined force that can operate across the spectrum of conflict in countries
8820414 when i was a divisional commander in germany in 99 to 2001 if you had asked me where i should optimize my training on the spectrum of conflict so i could be the most versatile i would have said if i can do conventional war i can do anything
8820415 after 32 months in iraq i dont believe that mostly the soldiers that have been to iraq and afghanistan dont believe that either theres enough difference some fundamental differences between irregular warfare and major conventional warfare that we need to be more versatile
8820416 first thing they said look general we dont need a bunch of fancy new programs
8820417 we committed ourselves to ratcheting up the level of support that were giving to soldiers and families
8820418 we doubled the amount of money that were putting towards soldier and family programs
8820419 i thank them for their sacrifice and for what theyre doing for this country they are making a difference at a very critical time in our countrys history and they are being successful at it
8820420 and i believe firmly that the efforts were making in iraq and afghanistan are allowing us to deal with the terrorist threat there and not here and its the men and women of the armed forces that are making that possible supported by their families
8820421 this ship is a tangible reflection of the skill and craft of thousands of industry and shipyard workers and it clearly demonstrates the nations commitment to a strong national defense
8820422 as a result of numerous production and process improvements electric boat is delivering new hampshire to the navy in 71 months 16 months fewer than the lead ship
8820423 put another way we reduced the time between when the ship enters the water and when it is delivered from 14 months on the first ship of the class to less than 6 months on the new hampshire
8820424 like the previous ships of the class new hampshire has been designed specifically to incorporate emergent technologies that will provide new capabilities to meet new threats
8820425 this enables the virginia class to make unique and significant contributions to national security for decades to come

8820428 envisioned using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging informative and entertaining
8820429 we entered into a marriage of game industry technical expertise and army core values and applied that to something really meaningful
8820430 americas army looked nothing like the other games it had high quality graphics animation and sound even though the game was free to players i think everyone expected it to be junk they were all surprised
8820431 soup to nuts virtual experience within which to explore entry level and advanced training as well as soldiering in small units
8820432 we have virtually taken our players through boot camp and airborne training and even introduced them to the special forces
8820433 through americas army players have learned about rules of engagement lifesaving laws of war and army values
8820434 this game will continue to build upon the marriage between thoroughbred game technologies and the army
8820435 we reviewed lessons from our first nine years and we are making decisions based on those lessons to make the game a more compelling and comprehensive test drive of the army well keep the aspects that are great about the current game and use the new engine to create an even better version
8820436 in everything a player does from the training phases to mission play there are consequences for their actions
8820437 were figuring out how to make these elements important to virtual players and through that instill pride in their achievements in the game
8820438 they have a persistent character in the game if they invest the time theyre likely to maximize their pursuit of opportunities and options advancement as a soldier in the game means something to them other games dont offer that
8820439 to get them in focus during our turbulent time of day to day operations
8820440 they wanted to be exposed to the safety discussion at the senior leadership level and thats what they got
8820441 i just think this summit which weve done for several years now helps us focus on very important topics
8820442 this event allows us to come together as senior commissioned and enlisted leaders and re energize and commit ourselves to making the air national guard better through strong leadership
8820443 commanders need to have such information at their fingertips that is going to help them take care of guardsman
8820444 we have to find ways to make safety a part of our daily routine and cultural outlook
8820445 when it comes to safety diversity and our culture and insisting on the highest standards in those and other areas it all comes down to one thing you can trace everything back to leadership
8820446 its a dynamic process its not a document you produce and put on the shelf
8820447 we are basically building a way ahead for the air guard
8820448 developing this roadmap guidance is just another step in the process for us to do a long range planning and to decide our future
8820449 the field definitely has a loud voice in the process their input will decide how it all works and goes together
8820450 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8820451 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8820452 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8820453 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8820454 from my perspective as an artilleryman being able to hit a moving ground target is a great advantage especially with insurgents using vehicles to escape quickly once theyre identified
8820455 its a complicated weapon to employ it takes two people backing each other up and making sure the weapon is employed properly
8820456 i thought it was a really rewarding part of being history in a sense when you consider the evolution of precision guided weapons
8820457 in world war ii it took a lot of bombs to take out a target due to low accuracy if i dont have accuracy i need more bombs
8820458 now the fact that we can nearly always put one weapon against one target means we need less ordnance to destroy a target and less air power to put against a threat to achieve a desired effect
8820459 that translates to less exposure to the threat environment and a higher probability of killing targets
8820460 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8820461 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible
8820462 at endgame on aug 12 the team of the u s air force joint terminal attack controller alongside his ground unit commander in this event ensured all criteria were met for the first combat delivery of the ljdam and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel
8820463 around 2006 warfighters started to ask us for better capabilities against movers
8820464 boeing came up with the idea of putting the laser kit on the gbu 38 and we pitched it to the air force under an urgent operational need request
8820465 endogenous retroviruses provide yet another example of molecular sequence evidence for universal common descent

8820474 it has helped me to learn how to interact better with work teams and to leverage my strengths in the workplace

8820478 i understand now that we just want to make sure that someone has the capability to do the job
8820479 we see the assessment as an opportunity for our professionals to better understand themselves

8820482 so there i was reading your story about the exercise pill not expecting that it would lift my spirits in a profound way when i got to the end and read the words of jeevan pendli
8820483 my most beloved relative passed away at age 89 my great uncle john foster west was the most inspirational and influential person in my life he was a writer poet novelist folklorist and a professor of creative writing at appalachian state he loved life and embraced it fully up until his late 70s he went jogging regularly on the blue ridge parkway he lived in a chalet just yards away from the parkway and worked out with weights into his mid 80s i made many pilgrimages in my life to see him he was my wise man on the mountaintop i still have not recovered from his death uncle john also loved mother earth and for many years his license plate was savearth now you know the connection to mr pendli
8820484 when i contacted the dmv in may and found out that someone else had claimed that plate i was disappointed i wanted it for myself to honor uncle john but now that i know a little bit about the person who has the plate im satisfied mr pendli sounds a bit like my uncle john in his enthusiasm for saving the planet and for keeping himself fit
8820485 i read your story and tears lingering in my eyes as i write this e mail
8820486 touching as it is but true more than fable i understand how important it is for you to keep the plate reminiscent of your proud uncle john i will make my effort to give it back to you in my next renewal
8820487 knowing that someone so young and vibrant and committed to the earth has the savearth plate makes me happy
8820488 you should keep that plate as long as you live in north carolina
8820489 i had finally arrived at the place where i was supposed to be
8820490 i flunked out twice and didnt finish my degree until 1979
8820491 my father used to joke that it took me three terms to graduate nixons fords and carters
8820492 the overhanging oaks create a comforting green tunnel in spring and summer a golden leaf shower in the fall and a spooky laced fingers canopy in the winter
8820493 in late august the humidity is so high water vapor is visible hanging in the air when midday sunbeams drill through the leaves and hit the vapor baby rainbows appear and disappear like bubbles blown from a childs toy
8820494 in high school during recess period i would go to the library and read the new york times
8820495 the attitude of most of my friends was youre never going to get out of robeson county i knew there was a bigger world out there
8820496 i had a vision in my head of college golden falling leaves blue skies girls in plaid skirts and fuzzy sweaters people with books
8820497 it confirmed my feelings of possibility that i could choose my own life
8820498 i have a much bigger life than i would have had thanks to the people i met there and the ideas i was exposed to
8820499 a lot of people are emailing me to say that they have made their first mccain donation tonight maybe mccain shouldnt speak next week and replay this instead

8820503 airdrop capability is indicative of the asymmetric advantages of airpower throughout the u s central commands area of responsibility
8820504 our u s air force and coalition air forces capability to airdrop supplies to our ground forces in isolated environments allows the collective forces to maintain the pressure on the enemy in many places in afghanistan our airdrops are the sole source of resupply to ground forces
8820505 the ability to provide this resupply in both routine and emergency situations is very rewarding for our aircrews and the joint service support crews that prepare the airdrop cargo from rigging the bundles to loading the aircraft
8820506 this particular airdrop milestone marks the greatest amount of combat resupply in a single year since hostilities began in 2001
8820507 our ability to airdrop supplies and equipment from our and allows us to continually take the fight to enemy ground forces because friendly forces get the supplies they need when they need them
8820508 the airdrop mission has been focused in afghanistan because the lack of infrastructure there has made it difficult to resupply overland
8820509 as coalition forces have increased their presence at forward operating bases throughout afghanistan the demand for combat airdrop resupply has increased as well
8820510 it has to be frustrating for an enemy to know that we can choose the time and place that we resupply our forces on the ground
8820511 particularly when the enemy must receive their supplies from overland sources in some of the most inaccessible real estate on the planet
8820512 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8820513 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8820514 i want a president who will put barney smith before smith barney
8820515 does anyone think barack obama would be the nominee without the support of soros and geffen
8820516 in writing this book we have uncovered why hes their guy and the answers are more than just a little sobering
8820517 the fact that barack obama surpassed hillary clinton against virtually all odds and expectations is not due to sheer charisma
8820518 charisma is nice to have but the reason barack obama is on the cusp of becoming president of the united states can be traced almost exclusively back to two people who are plotting the future of this country
8820519 what women want journalists and activists connect stories and solutions

8820521 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
8820522 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
8820523 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
8820524 hes terrified of intimacy and he knows if i take one step further im going to die in her arms i got him
8820525 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
8820526 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
8820527 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality

8820539 and it was just a total flashback i loved that song when i was a kid that jam reggae style i love that kind of music
8820540 its funny to look at that now but i completely understand it

8820566 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8820567 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8820568 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8820569 life is a challenge meet it life is a dream realize it life is a game play it life is love enjoy it

8820584 during my time in congress i have met many wonderful people who work for the federal government out of a sense of service to their country
8820585 unfortunately there is also a sizeable and growing number of federal employees who undermine the agencies they serve by failing to show up to work i believe the american taxpayer deserves better
8820586 the report is little more than a collection of numbers surrounded by innuendoes and loose extrapolations the problem with doing this kind of misrepresentation is that it tells federal employees their work is not valued and their contributions are not recognized making it much harder for agencies to recruit and retain the high quality employees they need
8820587 this isnt about the federal workforce this is about the management of the federal workforce
8820588 with a real possibility of getting an impact in louisiana
8820589 so were talking about a very serious storm and one that should be hitting the area perhaps monday into tuesday
8820590 three years later the same thing may happen its a little discouraging
8820591 im always going to remember being a little part of this
8820592 i care about the speech but im probably not going to remember most of what he says standing up here waving the flag talking to everybody around us in the stands all of that makes you feel like a part of something
8820593 i never thought id see a night like this in my lifetime
8820594 we had to apply for credentials and when we got them we knew we would come i mean a part of me still cant believe were here at something as big as this
8820595 isnt that family beautiful dont they have a pretty color of skin
8820596 im always going to remember being a little part of this
8820597 i care about the speech but im probably not going to remember most of what he says standing up here waving the flag talking to everybody around us in the stands all of that makes you feel like a part of something
8820598 i never thought id see a night like this in my lifetime
8820599 we had to apply for credentials and when we got them we knew we would come i mean a part of me still cant believe were here at something as big as this
8820600 i believe this election is close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change obama represents
8820601 we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama the next president of the united states
8820602 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8820603 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8820604 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8820605 this is the only way we make our living things are getting tougher and tougher
8820606 i dont know what well do if we dont hunt walrus
8820607 hubert needs to finish those carvings today and sell them today and only then can he go to the grocery store
8820608 this winter the maximum ice cover in the bering sea was actually above normal but that doesnt mean it doesnt retreat rapidly in summer
8820609 on land they are really vulnerable to predators and to being trampled by big males when a human or polar bear shows up they panic and stampede

8820612 this roman like facade or facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there its almost like he wants to come out and be emperor like in the setting at least the facade
8820613 john mccain will be surrounded next week in minneapolis with the lobbyists that run his campaign
8820614 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8820615 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8820616 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8820617 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8820618 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8820619 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
8820620 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
8820621 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
8820622 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
8820623 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
8820624 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
8820625 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
8820626 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
8820627 i struggled the first few months it was an uncertain time
8820628 the honest answer is i dont know i have nothing in mind
8820629 i cant recall a time when i had greater happiness
8820630 either i can get on with my life or i could roll the dice i concluded i just really needed to get on with my life
8820631 the more you reaffirm who you are in christ the more your behavior will begin to reflect your true identity
8820632 surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me
8820633 confession is a life long event so is repentance its about relationship it is not about what i do its about who ive given my life to
8820634 and we know that because of that event all of creation is under the curse of sin romans 8 19 23
8820635 since i cant do anything about sin i might as well keep sinning
8820636 in the late precambrian and for some time afterwards eastern newfoundland and southern britain along with what is now the east coast of the united states as far south as florida were located near each other along what is now the northwest coast of africa
8820637 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8820638 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8820639 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8820640 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8820641 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8820642 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8820643 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8820644 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8820645 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8820646 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8820647 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8820648 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8820649 tetapi sekarang aku pergi kepada dia yang telah mengutus aku dan tiada seorang pun di antara kamu yang bertanya kepada ku ke mana engkau pergi
8820650 our nation needs a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8820651 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend
8820652 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8820653 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8820654 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8820655 brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8820656 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8820657 something thats so close and still so far out of reach
8820658 but just like everything else those old crazy dreams just kinda came and went
8820659 were here to represent our ancestors yes indeedy every one of them
8820660 i must have spent 400 on buttons and shirts everybody says bring me something back but its not a problem i understand what theyre feeling
8820661 we already have our airline tickets to d c for the inaugural
8820662 i would like to see a qualified negro as president of the united states
8820663 but i suspect that even if this were today possible the necessities of the office would shape his actions far more than his racial identity
8820664 my first grandbaby is going to turn 1 on saturday
8820665 and for me this day represents new possibilities for her i want things for her to be different i dont want her to get paid 75 cents on the dollar like we are
8820666 they come up to me is he going to be okay is he going to make it little kids in many instances they cant even pronounce his name
8820667 they are counting on the american labor movement for boots on the ground and mobilization and its nice to be thought of that way
8820668 he has a lot of plans but he has not always articulated them in a passionate enough way
8820669 ive seen that message delivered its in his gut he just needs to be doing it more often
8820670 people will vote against their own economic interests out of fear out of demagoguery out of racism
8820671 what the mccain campaign has deteriorated to is scaring away voters it has created an atmosphere where there is fear and hesitance about senator obama
8820672 this election is about whether voters are comfortable voting for obama
8820673 concentrate your fire on one of the creatures beware their poison keep your distance and use ranged weapons
8820674 and pris you have that gun for a reason protect gene
8820675 simply the death of a child brings sadness in normal circumstances
8820676 if you were to add to this that our son had received so much abuse harm systematic torture and then in the end wrongful killing then you would get a better picture of what we feel
8820677 before we heard of his death we were hopeful he might be released any day and we were just awaiting his return
8820678 i really cannot find the words to express how that has impacted us
8820679 it would be inappropriate to provide significant advance notice to detainees regarding pending departures in the event plans could change with receiving nations among other concerns
8820680 our main focus is really the fact that the men were in the exclusive custody of the united states and the responsibility there is by virtue of that
8820681 i think the families want recognition of what they have suffered of the fact that their sons were wrongfully detained for four years without charge they want an apology which they have never had and they want closure
8820682 the government caused these deaths by first wrongfully detaining them and secondly in a most cowardly fashion refusing to acknowledge their mistake and immediately moving them out
8820683 they now say they were engaged in warfare against the united states if they died as enemies of this country we know who made them that
8820684 it is a government that has shown so much arrogance and misuse and abuse of power injustice and it has treaded over the rights of people and the feelings of people
8820685 during the past few years because of these practices it has generated so much hatred against it
8820686 i would put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
8820687 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
8820688 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8820689 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
8820690 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
8820691 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
8820692 i wish we had americans and american weapons but its not the case
8820693 they are living in a parallel world with a parallel perception if you say a lie in russia it becomes the truth the next day on tv
8820694 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8820695 im going to do a one hour special everyone is going to hear everything for themselves theyre going to hear everything dina has to say i have it all on tape all recorded time and date stamped you will hear it all i have 101 text messages between lindsay and i and i have about 60 tape recordings of dina these lies have to stop she cant say all these things to me and when i try to address it deny everything dinas a hypocrite and im tired of it
8820696 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8820697 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8820698 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area
8820699 what if a community organizer or social worker were president instead of an old skool politician
8820700 isnt it a little odd that restoring the default files from either ut usa or ut canada brings back the default scenery
8820701 he is terrific and one of the great things is that more people recognise what i see in him and all the obamas i see these great terrific people great role models when i first met the obamas my focus was that his younger sister would fall in love with me as i fell in love with her
8820702 so that was a pretty hard task you know because i wanted to make sure i left a good impression but he was terrific and this is what i first saw in all of them
8820703 what i find very interesting in the obama campaign or the obama affect is the fact that you see a whole new set of representations of different kinds of people in circulation
8820704 and i think that is progress the fact that people can look up to him as the president they can look up to our role models and there are more of them out there and i think it is an amazing contribution to the realm of popular culture
8820705 is that it turns the focus back to what we find in common the sense of values that we believe in as citizens of this country and what we want we want to be able to have our kids have great opportunities we want to be able to afford things like education and healthcare we want to face up to a public world to be better represented and more true to our core values
8820706 when you focus on that then you begin to recognise what we have more in common rather than well you know we have more work to do in this way we have more work to do now and so on
8820707 i was born and raised in hawaii i grew up also in indonesia and southeast asia
8820708 of course most importantly ive got a sister whos half indonesian whos married to a chinese canadian so i dont know what that makes my niece her name is suhaila
8820709 so this is part of my family this is part of my dna this is part of my genetic make up
8820710 my roommates were indian and pakistanis so i was creating peace i was a peacemaker long before i held office
8820711 he is very committed to this country he is very much an american man but i think that the world has offered wonderful layers of the flavours of the people and he respects all of it and he welcomes all of it
8820712 he takes it all in the great thing about him is he doesnt really discard anything he keeps it and he treasures it and i think all of his experiences all of those friendships all of his travels and even the literature and the music and the food that we have had access to
8820713 i think these have all made him a better diplomat a better leader more perspicacious more thoughtful more interesting smarter stronger and yes that they certainly will impact the degree to which he is able to connect with the rest of the world and connect with different people here in this country in order to effectively impact their future
8820714 he does have a great sense of humour i mean michelle is probably the funniest in the family if you get to know her youll see that but barack has a great sense of humour and he can be very self deprecating too hes a very low key guy growing up with him was great
8820715 he couldnt help but be inclusive because of the way he was raised we had a mother who lived in so many different countries she worked in india and pakistan and quite extensively in bangladesh she worked in west africa like the ghana region and in east africa she worked in south america in thailand and malaysia and singapore and so forth and she shared all these stories with us
8820716 but also it was something that was part of her general perspective on life this notion that you know we are essentially the same at the core and that that should be emphasised that that should be highlighted and that we should encourage open gatherings with as many different people from as many places as possible
8820717 my mother left behind for me some dolls from my childhood she left them for my children before she died i wish she could have met her grandchildren baracks children and mine she wanted so much to have grandchildren and she would have enjoyed them
8820718 they are funny they look like the united nations its like every conceivable place is presented
8820719 i believe that it was very important for her to remind us both that the world was an interesting tapestry and that we would become more interesting the more time that we spent touching these different textures
8820720 a great sense of play and i think that our family in general were very low key we jest with one another we jostle and we play games
8820721 we know that unfortunately sometimes indians and pakistanis still struggle with one another but barack he has never struggled with anyone and he actually managed to build bridges from very early on and he continues to do so

8820732 this was a very very disappointing loss for me but its something that i have to accept
8820733 i dont realise yet that i beat the number one in the world i dont realise i played on a big court i dont know how im going to sleep tonight

8820739 i have not met him but i am definitely going to meet him not only chandrababu all other leaders are my friends i am going to meet even those leaders who are not my friends
8820740 if we have good policies and if people are convinced that we are serious in our commitment to work towards their welfare and in their interest people will accept our party and guide us
8820741 the game is different and the rules are different we have to play every game according to its rules
8820742 she was the closest model to human perfection he could find
8820743 we have decided that your plan was worth looking into and the admiral decided to go with it its up to you not to die
8820744 none of the men had ever listened to her ideas let alone done one
8820745 and they never did again until i grabbed their testicles and threatened to pull

8820756 i know you want to give this speech i know youre itching to take it to mccain i know youre seething that hes calling you a celebrity i know you want to demonstrate that you wont be swiftboated and i know the delegates are demanding attack attack and more attack
8820757 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8820758 red america not a blue america but the united states of america
8820759 mccain said he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8820760 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8820761 tonight would be political malpractice its one more piece of evidence that the mccain campaign is a war room masquerading as a presidential campaign
8820762 if they do it i will pay all of mccains mortgages next month
8820763 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured so there you have it voila problem solved
8820764 are demanding that party leaders punish sen joe lieberman the democrat turned independent because of his support of sen john mccain
8820765 for many of them liebermans plan to speak at next weeks republican convention in st paul minn is the latest offense from the man who represented their state as a democrat in washington for 18 years
8820766 by a grey unmarked chevy suv with police lights two men wearing suits using ear pieces were in the driver and passenger seats
8820767 the high visibility mission is the latest stop in a whirlwind campaign swing that for several days recently sent pawlenty barnstorming for republican candidate john mccain across the battleground states of ohio and pennsylvania it culminates months in which pawlentys national profile has risen amid speculation about his chances of being chosen as mccains running mate
8820768 once again the battle for florida appears to be at the political epicenter of another presidential race
8820769 no i never thought i would live to see it i thought it would happen one day but i never thought i would live to see it it will be a great thing to have lived to see it
8820770 is drawing inspiration for his acceptance speech thursday night from three past convention speeches those of bill clinton in 1992 ronald reagan in 1980 and john f kennedy in 1960
8820771 the speech is substantially written but as with all obama speeches he will be refining it and buffing it up right to the end
8820772 obama began thinking about the speech before he left for vacation in hawaii and has been working it intermittently ever since axelrod said sometimes with speechwriters other times alone in a chicago hotel room he writes longhand on a legal pad types his notes into a computer and circulates drafts among his staff
8820773 succeed here and obamas speech will be remembered as one of the most powerful moments in modern politics a perfect launch into the final stage of the general election fail and obama risks fueling republicans criticism that he is an aloof celebrity fond of speaking to big crowds but incapable of forming genuine connections
8820774 was sealed after sen hillary clinton stepped forward to cast new yorks 282 votes midway through the state by state roll call wednesday afternoon but in a carefully orchestrated gesture she moved that delegates dispense with the rest of the formalities
8820775 lets declare in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate
8820776 called sen joe lieberman i ct late last week and urged him to contact sen john mccain r az to withdraw his name from vice presidential consideration
8820777 readers know my personal disdain for bill clinton but longtime readers will also know i have always defended his solid centrist smart record in office and defended him against his most over reaching enemies tonight i think was one of the best speeches he has ever given
8820778 the speech he offered could have been a joint release from the economic policy institute and the center for american policy foreign affairs department but somehow when clinton reads it policy slips free of the weighty terms and looping sentences that press it down and drifts upward to read easily as part of the human condition engaged with our everyday experience its a remarkable skill and one that no other current politician possesses
8820779 he may nevert be completely absolved by obamas core supporters and his standing will probably never be restored to the olympian heights of a couple of years ago but that was full throated sincere sounding and sophisticated case for his wifes former mortal rival
8820780 bill clinton just demonstrated that hes still the best the democrats have
8820781 he himself rose to the occasion with a decisive hopeful and generous affirmation that barack obama is ready to be president of the united states this unambiguous declaration was the most important phrase uttered since the convention began
8820782 health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits
8820783 she would get stomachaches she was tormented and going to school was the worst
8820784 our pediatrician suggested she see a psychologist boy that was the best decision i could have made
8820785 it impacts a persons life more dramatically or causes them more distress
8820786 doing things that were normal for everyone else was so hard for me and i didnt know why
8820787 it was fine but even if it went well next morning id be nervous again
8820788 if you keep putting yourself into situations it will only make you stronger even if you are really nervous its better to expose yourself to anxious situations than to avoid them
8820789 but i kept running into parents with kids who had the same problem
8820790 i had tried to read nonfiction books to jenna about social anxiety
8820791 i thought if there was a memorable story if it was entertaining kids might actually read it
8820792 brave be ready and victorys easy a story about social anxiety
8820793 if i hadnt gone to school and forced myself to go through those situations i wouldnt be the same today
8820794 i hope we hit so many balls off the wall that they have to check 10 of them
8820795 its about getting them all right more than anything else
8820796 so if they can tell us that this is going to help get them all right then this is good whenever they put it in
8820797 i was putting pressure on myself to hit lefties because i know its the only thing holding me back from being an everyday player
8820798 at a time when the economy appears to be slowing overall and some major companies have reported declines in sales the liquor control boards annual sales growth represents a truly remarkable achievement
8820799 the commonwealth would have had to turn to other revenue sources to pay for essential services such as public safety education transportation and health care
8820800 the difference is a result of a policy decision by the legislature not a reflection of plcbs performance
8820801 the record pace we set at the beginning of the year is slowing which may mean 2008 wont be a record year for foreclosures after all
8820802 as of now this is a record year for foreclosures but the drop in july combined with the drop were seeing thus far in august shows the tide may be turning
8820803 i doubt anyone would argue now that the 2000 election didnt matter
8820804 mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again
8820805 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8820806 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8820807 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8820808 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8820809 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8820810 abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8820811 a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8820812 abandon ing the search for the terrorists who attacked us
8820813 because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation
8820814 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8820815 was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
8820816 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8820817 what his whole campaign is about is bringing people together
8820818 the mix of people young old gay straight white black everything you could imagine was represented in the crowd and it was just really really exciting
8820819 workin for the man wholl do more for the workin man

8820828 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8820829 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8820830 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8820831 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8820832 this is truly an amazing moment not just for black people but for the country
8820833 i only wished that my mother who was born in minneapolis had lived to witness it in those days we were all different all the races and we couldnt imagine that we would come together like this
8820834 its an honor to witness something so historical and what i love about barack is his class his quiet courage how he speaks on the issues but doesnt attack the character of his opponents
8820835 i do believe that if you can imagine it it is possible even as improbable as it has seemed given how visceral the feelings are around race
8820836 john mccain likes to say that he will follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8820837 we will all remember where we were who we were with
8820838 we have lost so many leaders and i just trust that he will be safe
8820839 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8820856 one of the things he said was that he had found in research that the people who already had a luxury car were in some ways more receptive to genesis than those who did not have a luxury car the people who had luxury cars realized it wasnt a life changer for them while those who did not have a luxury car yet were the ones who were striving for prestige
8820857 its usually very expensive to establish a separate dealership network for a new brand
8820858 but i also think you can stretch a brand so far to be offering vehicles that cost 10 000 or 20 0000 and others for 40 000 is quite a stretch

8820906 this is the only way you can receive this kind of anointing
8820907 the workshop was geared towards facilitating the exchange of regulatory knowledge and good experiences and creating awareness on regional regulatory priorities and initiatives to promote good regulatory practices in forum island countries
8820908 previous workshops and studies have found that the greatest potential for enhancement of economic regulation is at the level of regional provision of services mainly in terms of technical support for regulators and countries that choose to participate
8820909 while the extent of support required will vary from country to country and it is desirable that there be flexibility in the way and the level at which the support is provided at the same time there have been a number of issues and challenges common to forum island countries and common strategies and approaches can be developed
8820910 in identifying common sectors where economic regulation would be most significant participants came up with a regional regulatory stepladder approach identifying short term and medium term goals
8820911 participants also recognized a number of activities and actions to be taken at national and regional levels
8820912 group discussions amongst the smaller islands states identified proposed areas for support such as shipping information and communications technology ict and public utilities
8820913 not only is mark shauers energy plan in direct conflict with voters who want congress to take immediate action to drill for more american oil its in direct conflict with energy experts who call the plan devastating

8820921 the arroyo government better not be stubborn this is just a prelude to a nation wide transport strike we are gearing up for next month if our demands are not met
8820922 p6 7 which is roughly equivalent to the oil price hikes in may and june this year we are concerned that it is taking the oil companies forever to give consumers a substantial relief from high oil prices
8820923 the small rollbacks while welcome are not enough given the huge increases over the past few months
8820924 with vat prices of commodities have gone so high the majority of poor families are feeling the impact especially women and children
8820925 inflation has already reached 11 4 percent the highest in 14 years and all the government does is to tell us the vat is good for us this surely doesnt make much sense given the severe economic burden on the people and the ensuing economic slowdown facing the country
8820926 its not the gun whatever it may be hes looking for fresh human odor

8820928 he can point out danger situations before we get to them
8820929 we are also studying the possibility of widening the coverage of the writ of amparo by providing protection to economic social and cultural rights including protection against demolitions and bringing the judiciary closer to the poor

8820931 ang mga slapp cases na ito ay may layuning manakot manggipit at magpahirap sa publiko tulad na lang nga mga these slapp cases are meant to sow fear pressure and make it difficult for the public like the multimillion libel cases slander that people feel it difficult to pursue justice
8820932 to respond to the slapp cases that are being used to confuse and stop the upholding of economic social and cultural rights under the constitution part of this will also be the slapp back action for damages against those filing senseless slapp cases we will also study processes that are being implemented in canada us and europe where slapp cases and slapp back actions originated

8821160 mikheil saakashvili started this war with his barrage attack and occupation of south ossetia russias war of retribution was far less violent or excessive than the u s bombing of serbia for 78 days over kosovo or our unprovoked war on saddam husseins iraq which has brought death to scores of thousands or israels 35 days of bombing of lebanon
8821161 zardari has been advised to stay in a safe place and under the cover of official security
8821162 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8821163 man wouldnt it just blow if my nose started bleeding like the bitch it is
8821164 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be and that the military to military relationship were building with pakistan is getting stronger every day
8821165 there is a growing complexity and coordination among extremist groups there an almost syndicate like behaviour that has resulted in new and ever more sophisticated attacks on coalition forces
8821166 to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day
8821167 thats a continuous ongoing discussion no big breakthroughs there still committed to where we can and where they ask us committed to help them and train them where they ask for the kind of assistance that they think they need
8821168 the americans also said that they were afraid to share intelligence with pakistan because such data is often leaked to the militants
8821169 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8821170 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8821171 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
8821172 i have a dream speech 45 years ago to the day obama said
8821173 now obama represents the right course we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states al gore added
8821174 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8821175 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8821176 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8821177 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8821178 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8821179 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8821180 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8821181 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8821182 you know every night we send a pretty good pitcher to the mound a lot of times those games are going to flow your way
8821183 mentors of young scientists need to exhibit the highest standard of ethical behaviour and collegiality
8821184 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of central elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8821185 you learn to be patient this game is a marathon not a sprint
8821186 hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him

8821188 agnieszka fryszman a partner at cohen milstein hausfeld amp toll said 13 nepali men between the ages of 18 and 27 were recruited in nepal to work as kitchen staff in hotels and restaurants in amman jordan but once the men arrived in jordan their passports were seized and they were told they were being sent to a military facility in iraq fryszman said as the men were driven in cars to iraq they were stopped by insurgents twelve were kidnapped and later executed fryszman said the thirteenth man survived and worked in a warehouse in iraq for 15 months before returning to nepal the lawsuit filed in a federal court in california on behalf of the workers families and the survivor claims that the trafficking scheme was engineered by kbr and its jordanian subcontractor daoud amp partners according to fryszman
8821189 we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilising drug of gradualism
8821190 a very large number of the clearance teams will be stopping by the end of this month if we dont get funds before that
8821191 conventional coffee cups are made from ceramic compositions which do not absorb microwaves and hence they do not heat up when conventional ceramics are used for heating food only food heats up and then the hot food heats up the ceramic
8821192 the microwaves heat up the container and hence the food rice cooks in about half or less time
8821193 these ceramic materials not only heat up with microwaves but also retain heat for about 15 minutes and hence the food stays hot in the container ceramic plates could be used for pizza delivery as these plates are insulating materials
8821194 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time
8821195 he raced at a time when racing was extremely dangerous and got through it all without a serious injury
8821196 he had an extraordinary mechanical sense he was very much in tune with the car

8821198 the video is practically non stop performances from over two dozen bands with some extra backstage and fan footage for good measure

8821201 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8821202 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8821203 worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction
8821204 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time
8821205 senator mccain likes to talk about judgement but really what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8821206 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8821207 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8821208 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8821209 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8821210 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8821211 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
8821212 i am happy to be in the third round for me this is a very important tournament
8821213 he is a good player i am going to have to play better to beat him
8821214 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
8821215 i better be ready that girl is a tough cookie
8821216 the federal communications commission has spent nearly a year testing devices designed to use empty television channels known as white spaces for high speed internet service as those tests near conclusion the agency is evaluating yet another proposal about the best use of the airwaves technology giants such as google microsoft and motorola want the fcc to let them use vacant channels without licensing to provide cheap wireless broadband
8821217 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurised contents
8821218 the gram panchayat played a vital role by donating about 50 acres of land for the sainik school till the time the school building is constructed temporary accommodation for the functioning of the school would be made available in the primary school building community hall and youth hostel in rewari town
8821219 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states
8821220 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8821221 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the sides and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seemed like an easy solution the thing is it turns out that its not always so
8821222 to suggest that the us orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8821223 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8821224 when this card is removed from play you can send 1 card from your hand to the graveyard to draw 1 card
8821225 believe me woman the time is coming when you samaritans will worship the father neither here at this mountain nor there in
8821226 haleluya keselamatan dan kemuliaan dan kekuasaan adalah pada allah kita 19 2 sebab benar dan adil segala penghakiman nya karena ialah yang telah menghakimi pelacur besar itu yang merusakkan bumi dengan percabulannya dan ialah yang telah membalaskan darah hamba hamba nya atas pelacur itu
8821227 pujilah allah kita hai kamu semua hamba nya kamu yang takut akan dia baik kecil maupun besar
8821228 haleluya karena tuhan allah kita yang mahakuasa telah menjadi raja 19 7 marilah kita bersukacita dan bersorak sorai dan memuliakan dia karena hari perkawinan anak domba telah tiba dan pengantin nya telah siap sedia 19 8 dan kepadanya dikaruniakan supaya memakai kain lenan halus yang berkilau kilauan dan yang putih bersih
8821229 tuliskanlah berbahagialah mereka yang diundang ke perjamuan kawin anak domba
8821230 janganlah berbuat demikian aku adalah hamba sama dengan engkau dan saudara saudaramu yang memiliki kesaksian yesus sembahlah allah karena kesaksian yesus adalah roh nubuat
8821231 marilah ke sini dan berkumpullah untuk turut dalam perjamuan allah perjamuan yang besar 19 18 supaya kamu makan daging semua raja dan daging semua panglima dan daging semua pahlawan dan daging semua kuda dan daging semua penunggangnya dan daging semua orang baik yang merdeka maupun hamba baik yang kecil maupun yang besar
8821232 janganlah berbuat demikian aku adalah hamba sama dengan engkau dan saudara saudaramu yang memiliki kesaksian yesus sembahlah allah karena kesaksian yesus adalah roh nubuat
8821233 i havent changed my level of optimism around our business and demand levels and our ability to grow
8821234 the industry is still projecting double digit growth i still want to grow faster than the industry
8821235 i am more on a watch mode than drawing any conclusions at this point of time
8821236 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8821237 she was using language to get at what she wanted she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8821238 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8821239 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further
8821240 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8821241 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8821242 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8821243 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia

8821249 interessava lhe sobretudo nos livros como na vida explorar os labirintos da escolha individual
8821250 o amor dissolve em fumo qualquer esc ndalo por mais estranho que ele surja aos nossos aparentes valores
8821251 como explicar lhe que s preciso do que n o serve para nada
8821252 recuso me ao miserabilismo de ter opini es prefiro viver de emo o e pensamento
8821253 mesmo em lugares onde a fome senhora das almas os livros s o adorados e disputados
8821254 agora que a pele se tornou um tecido as pessoas j n o t m como se despir que tristeza o fim do erotismo
8821255 quanto mais intensa a fonte de luz menos suport vel olh la e mais sombra provoca at que apenas um lado seja v sivel
8821256 o amor um polvo capitalista quanto mais apertado pela concorr ncia mais cresce
8821257 e o que o feio sen o uma verdade diferente daquela para que fomos codificados
8821258 a ironia uma prova superior da intelig ncia e a intelig ncia o ramo iluminado da maldade

8821266 we observe the strike in central universities all over the country to demand that the report of the committee headed by prof g k chaddha be submitted soon
8821267 estudio econ mico de am rica latina y el caribe 2007 2008 elaborado por ese organismo la inflaci n en la regi n fue del 6 5 por ciento en 2007 en tanto que el aumento en los precios de los alimentos alcanz ese a o un 10 7 por ciento

8821269 england is a very popular destination for japanese visitors due to its traditions beautiful buildings and spectacular scenery
8821270 the lake district is especially popular because so many japanese love peter rabbit
8821271 visitors from japan want to see the beautiful scenery that was included in the beatrix potter books
8821272 to the love of my life our next first lady michelle obama and to malia and sasha
8821273 i love you so much and im so proud of you
8821274 she woke me up at 4 30 in the morning and wed sit there and go through my lessons
8821275 and if i grumbled shed say well this is no picnic for me either buster
8821276 that was it after that day i was in love with him
8821277 the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8821278 we are going to be much stronger than we were last year
8821279 we have an all american coming the only all american from nevada
8821280 we want to win the league and go to nationals thats our ultimate goal
8821281 aint nothing wrong if you want to do the butt all night long
8821282 the commission on presidential debates is in control of the number of seats available
8821283 unfortunately students get an extremely limited number of tickets and we wanted to create several different ways for students to win tickets
8821284 the student steering committee has a subcommittee that was in charge of coming up with event ideas and a cohesive plan that would distribute the student tickets
8821285 they have had a tough week of training but they have refocused and got our loss behind us and i think everyone is looking forward to getting on the field again
8821286 we certainly worked a little harder than we might have had we not gone into overtime against western kentucky we trained harder and longer to make sure they are ready for a game that lasts two hours
8821287 both are quality programs with quality players smu is one of the top teams in our region and we are playing at their place it is going to be a battle and a huge challenge they are a great program with a lot of history and pride behind them and they will be playing to knock us off
8821288 then having to turn around and play a team like tcu two days later in 95 degree heat is going to be a huge challenge for us we have to take it one game at a time and bring our very best each time we step on the field
8821289 we not only get to attend and help out at the convention but we also get to hear speeches from politicians and other insiders
8821290 the past few days have taught me so much about conservatism and help me grow as individual
8821291 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8821292 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8821293 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8821294 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicted on when its supposed to arrive
8821295 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8821296 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8821297 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8821298 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i have never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8821299 having the capitol steps here couldnt be timelier in anticipation of the presidential debate life is going to get kind of difficult for a while and challenging and this may very well be the last laugh
8821300 we thought the capitol steps would be a really great complement to the debate
8821301 the theory is that it will counterpoint the seriousness of the debate
8821302 they write songs based on known tunes generally or familiar tunes but the words have been changed to poke fun at something in the headlines politically
8821303 its going to be a lot of fun and funny they dont pick sides theyre not poking fun at the republicans or the democrats theyre poking fun at everybody
8821304 its something thats accessible to everybody they might get a chance to learn about some of the issues that theyre not familiar with as well but in a very fun non serious way
8821305 the capitol steps are a wonderful group of performers they have a real light hearted broad based perspective on the political arena
8821306 its just going to be an awful lot of fun its the start of a really good way to enjoy whats happening here and all the activities surrounding the presidential debate
8821307 we wanted to find the level of gang involvement in the city of oxford and the surrounding communities
8821308 last year i went before the school board because i wanted a stricter policy for gang related incidents
8821309 we did get real credible sources credible data on the street level in oxford it appears that parents are more tentative and law enforcement is keeping gang violence at bay
8821310 the level of this problem is low but we ultimately decided that programs are the next step and it would be good to hear back from the community
8821311 i can think of no better choice than jim lehrer
8821312 hes got a great reputation as a journalist and as a fair and non partisan television commentator
8821313 we hope to help kids that was the whole point of the board adopting it
8821314 we hope we dont catch anybody were not out to get kids were out to give a way to say no to get them safe and get them some help if they do have a problem
8821315 the kids who do drugs dont do stuff with the school
8821316 they may find a few people but the real drug heads they cant find
8821317 i am exempt from it the testing and i dont know any of my friends or anyone else who is exempt
8821318 the acceptance has been generally good there have been some questions raised about details of the procedures and how its carried out but no one seems to be having a problem with it
8821319 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8821320 general hood cautioned merchants that once a state of emergency is declared they may not increase their profits
8821321 my mom works at a hospital and they are already talking about evacuating
8821322 especially with the anniversary of katrina this is kind of ominous deja vu really
8821323 were just praying for the best case scenario were still recovering emotionally
8821324 i hate to wish it on any one else but i hope it doesnt hit the mississippi coast because that will drastically stall the economy
8821325 we have to be great fundamentally sound technicians everybody has to do their part its no secret we know their height we know their weight we know they are very good receivers thats their strength
8821326 they teach us how to play receivers who are taller anywhere you go there is going to be a 6 foot 4 or 6 foot 5 receiver and there is going to normally be a 5 foot 8 or 5 foot 9 corner its all in the technique you have to be disciplined and cornerbacks coach chris vaughn tells us everyday how to play
8821327 theres a whole bunch of defensive back secrets you need to know
8821328 we just go over it everyday and try to be smart with it the key is playing real smart and knowing your receiver because every wide receiver is different
8821329 whoever i hold and whoever my other teammate holds i just trust them and they trust me
8821330 its just like we are going to see all year
8821331 one thing about this conference one thing about this schedule is that we are going to see great receivers every week we might as well start out with a great group and see what we have we are going to go out and compete and find out where we are
8821332 il y a dautres objectifs que lon peut supposer tre les objectifs de la russie en particulier la crim e lukraine la moldavie
8821333 on ne fait rien aux russes destonie qui pourrait entra ner une telle r action r pond il et la derni re fois que cet argument a t utilis c tait par milosevic et avant par hitler quand on voque ce genre darguments on ne parle pas de leurope civilis e
8821334 je crois quil est assez vident que ce refus a t interpr t par la russie comme un feu vert pour faire ce quelle voulait en g orgie
8821335 je dois dire que je suis plus inquiet de la formation dune
8821336 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8821337 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8821338 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
8821339 consumers just simply couldnt tell a good distributor from a bad one
8821340 a vast amount of products is available but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards
8821341 we will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health
8821342 one product we found called original herbal ecstasy contained nutmeg which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants
8821343 yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications they could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis
8821344 there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated
8821345 after having launched currency futures we need to revitalise exchange traded interest rate derivatives markets offer exchange traded credit derivatives and also need to strengthen the corporate bond markets
8821346 these three products are high on the priority list of the government and i ask the government to move forward on this
8821347 subvention given for sugar exports must now come to an end
8821348 enough sugar has been exported and i have spoken to the ministry of agriculture on this
8821349 this convention was initially diverted by the clinton psychodrama and some initial muddling of the message but now i suspect it will be remembered for catharsis and above all for obamas terrific confident inspiring moment of grace
8821350 i cant stand seeing all these worldwide liberals and american democrats buying all this messiah setup some of us are hardly enduring he should advice chavezs al presidente and fidels speeches or was it the other way around
8821351 ive heard a few people say that he seemed to hold back from giving the soaring speech he might have given but i suspect that was intentional and i think a good decision meta themes and tonality form the deeper structure of political communication and the aim of this speech was not eloquence but strength
8821352 obama was bitter clinging i guess you could say having said that i wouldnt be surprised in the slightest if obama won hes promising the moon the sun the stars sometimes the american people have to see that ideas that sound too good to be true always are and that command and control big government doesnt work
8821353 ive voted republican nearly all my life im still a proud ron paul supporter but obama has clearly convinced me he is a far better candidate than mccain who is basically george bush with intelligence and that might be even more dangerous
8821354 this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away know hope
8821355 i am a 63 year old republican i have voted republican since goldwater i voted twice for bush and i apologize to the entire world for that obamas speech was the most incredible i have heard in my lifetime i will proudly cast my vote for him and i pray that my country will follow my example
8821356 i just finished listening to obamas speech and all i can say is wow this was the most important speech of his public life so far and he delivered
8821357 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8821358 conclusion this needed to be a serious speech and it was im still not sure about the doric columns but hes managed to be convincing despite the overbearing backdrop one of the features of the speech was the frequent reference to the future hes not saying mccains too old for the job at least not in so many words but the obama camp know that americans are worried about mccains age and ever so subtly they are making an allusion to it
8821359 obama had the opportunity of a life time to bring republicans and independents together instead he sounded like a partisan hack what a wasted opportunity
8821360 no smile at the end i thought he was reading up on reagan speeches in preparation
8821361 this has been the most aggressive speech of the week and the most substantive ive seen obama give its not a thematic address its not about hope or values or the universality of the american experience of the illusory obstacles that divide us its concrete
8821362 america our dreams can be one america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise
8821363 obama is now making the case that he will be a world leader and not a isolationist with few friends in the world
8821364 a reprise of his very successful 2004 convention speech there are no red states or blue states only the united states
8821365 i realise im not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree what the naysayers dont understand is this election has never been about me its about you
8821366 a very interesting choice of word there on who would make the better commander in chief he asked who had the better temperament
8821367 a good line on health about how he watched his mother arguing on the phone with insurance companies as she lay in bed dying of cancer an experience familiar to many americans
8821368 dawning of a new day the greatness can return america can turn the page and welcome new leadership yes we can the soft music and sob story so much emotion so much hype
8821369 quite a brave line there on oil drilling john mccain is proposing to open up americas coast for drilling which has proved popular obama is sticking to his line that its not a solution
8821370 i want my daughters to have the same opportunities as your sons
8821371 the non sequiters are amazing this speech isnt meeting the hype
8821372 hes chosen to lead off on economic themes which is no surprise the way he phrases it is so important he needs to hit home to individuals in mainstream america im not sure he has bidens touch
8821373 the obama biographical video is very well done but its somewhat easy to see the seams footage of pattons army the landing of the astronauts in the ocean lots and lots of pictures of the family translation im not strange or exotic or alien im normal american im patriotic
8821374 now is the time to end this oil addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8821375 by the way its a stunning evening here in denver i mention this because some fundamentalist christians of a right wing persuasion prayed for rain proof that god is a democrat
8821376 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8821377 thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8821378 we democrats measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president
8821379 that stirring obama video it was a real triumph moving and poignant without descending into schmaltz the emphasis on kansas pattons army and the dunham family was expected and surely necessary but still quite well executed the bit about his aging grandparents ought to go over especially well with holdout older voters
8821380 i dont believe that mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of ordinary americans i just believe hes doesnt know mccain doesnt get it
8821381 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8821382 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8821383 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8821384 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8821385 through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8821386 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8821387 he strides out very purposefully dressed very formally presidentially wearing a white shirt and a restrained red tie the look is sober and thats important
8821388 if youre bummed about not getting a ticket to watch the obama speech at the invesco center youll be happy to know theyre still giving away tickets for john mccains veep announcement tomorrow at the aptly named 12 000 seat nutter center
8821389 on first read obamas speech strikes me for the simplicity of its core for most of the way there are no lyrical flights or poetic riffs here but you cant leave a crowd like that with nothing so the speech does close on a loftier note on paper it looks like a good balance well see how it works shortly
8821390 a monumental occasion in our nations history certainly for black people but i think for all americans
8821391 obama wasnt able to roll out a major republican endorser at this convention eisenhowers dont really count as apostates any more so he gives prime time to a pair of republicans in the last two slots the core message isnt about obamas biography or his character its that american workers cant take more gop economic policy
8821392 this has been a mixture of show business politics and history here at the denver broncos stadium there is a huge sense of expectation here
8821393 the closest thing to a unifying theme has been the line repeated often that mccain voted with bush 90 of the time but thats supporting evidence not a brand for the attack as such theres been no particular shorthand that democrats have used to tie all their speeches and attacks together which has made the convention feel a bit disjointed
8821394 i cant help but suspect that team obama is going with what theyre best at spectacle and pageantry the packed stadium the rock stars thousands upon thousands chanting his name ironically at a time when disgruntled folks in the focus groups are saying theyre tiring of the glitz and glamor and want specifics and details saying its time for a change all the obama campaign has to offer is more of the same
8821395 how real and how fair is the democracy of our beautifully diverse country if every single president is a white man
8821396 as the regular folk get caught by the camera you see them go nuts and wave their flags you see black white yellow young old men women gays straights chatting and milling as they would at a concert or sports event it normalizes an otherwise alienating political event it comes off as a mass gathering of ordinary people
8821397 abkhazia and south ossetia have much stronger grounds for independence than kosovo
8821398 it is impossible to form an objective picture of what happened
8821399 georgia planned the action against south ossetia in advance the only thing they did not expect was that russia would react so forcefully
8821400 while updating them on financial advice but somethings off about him and his devoted wife sakshi prachi desai despite her best efforts is not invited into his personal space and thoughts
8821401 india and nepal can work together to avoid such a tragedy in the future we can work together so that our people do not have to face such misery again next year
8821402 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
8821403 stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right
8821404 in the context of certain remarks made by bhattacharjee in a meeting of assocham in kolkata
8821405 it has consistently supported all india general strikes of the trade unions against the neo liberal policies of the central government and other urgent issues of the working class and toiling people
8821406 i cannot afford to return the 400 acres if that land has to be returned then tata motors project has to be dropped i cannot allow this to happen
8821407 it was not legally possible to return the land i am not an egoist
8821408 the panel has also agreed to reconstitute sasb and induct members from the state into it
8821409 the janipur residents have brought crackers for the celebrations the celebrations would begin as soon as the agreement is announcement
8821410 weve submitted our demands in writing to the panel and are expecting a favourable response
8821411 the catholic diocese of lucknow after consulting the principals of city schools heads of the church of north india diocese of lucknow and the methodist church have decided to close all educational institutions in lucknow under their authority
8821412 boxing will always be my priority but since im a youth icon i will associate myself with whatever the youth likes
8821413 main kabhi bhi alcohol or smoking ki endorsements nahin karoonga
8821414 dont you think youre wasting precious time when youre doing modelling and endorsements
8821415 in the post vote of confidence scenario we will discuss our relation with the samajwadi party and i have spoken to amar singh and on august 30th and 31st we will meet
8821416 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8821417 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8821418 snatching a win here and snatching a win there is not what im about in the future its about being consistent
8821419 coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game
8821420 its happened to us before and weve lost not just to bangladesh but to a lot of teams
8821421 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game so its important we concentrate on saturday
8821422 i took about 60 photos and maybe three came out well
8821423 so heute ist genau der richtige zeitpunkt mir mal selbst den tag zu versauen indem ich
8821424 you know this is an event a week that is all about words
8821425 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8821426 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and the judgement to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate that im ready to have
8821427 america we can not turn back we can not walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise
8821428 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners such as france but also many others including germany and all nato countries
8821429 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states deliberately created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and thereby creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of president
8821430 i have moments when i get angry so it reflects me from start to finish
8821431 however with time ive also learned to love dressing women who perhaps werent beautiful but who had something about them more than beauty
8821432 we dont see the withdrawal of russian troops we dont see the progress on the peacekeeping processes in this region and we have also to focus on how europe can speak with one voice because that is the most important thing
8821433 first of all i highly doubt that that might ever happen but hypothetically speaking this would be to the detriment of the european union as much if not more than to russia
8821434 rogy and i are pretty tight and he called me a couple of years ago when i went to singapore on a three year deal and then last year when there was trouble there and we thought we were going to fall over he called me again
8821435 i really couldnt do much if they went ahead but if they didnt i was seriously considering coming to perth then
8821436 but singapore got it together so i stayed but this is the third time he tried to get me
8821437 over time it just made sense i feel im coming into a fantastic situation
8821438 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8821439 its not hard to do that but it doesnt make any difference
8821440 so its about actions and the challenge to the players is im confident they can do it and i hope theyre confident they can do it
8821441 the group has responded to probably every challenge that has been thrown at them over the past six years
8821442 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8821443 so weve answered a few questions there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8821444 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8821445 can we win next week we absolutely can next week if we play our best footy and get our guys into some form
8821446 and thats the challenge for all of us to get back into form
8821447 actually ryan is a bit crook so hes one who might not play
8821448 its just the flu going around he was a bit crook yesterday
8821449 we wont take any risks with him hes probably a 50 50 chance at this stage
8821450 theres a lot of buzz about the new championship and the new formats it is introducing to the sport
8821451 it will be great to race alongside chad the spotlight is on him after his recent world championship win and this can only be good for other australian riders as their talent is placed on a world stage
8821452 i am so excited that jeremy is going to come down to australia and race in two rounds of super x
8821453 he is a true legend of the sport and was my hero when i was coming through the ranks this is an opportunity of a lifetime for australian sporting fans to see jeremy myself and dan reardon all going head to head
8821454 from the outset weve promised the world a groundbreaking new supercross series and the confirmation of jeremy mcgrath is a major coup
8821455 jeremy transformed the sport and much of the following it enjoys today is due to his dominance and the incredible breed of sportsmanship he brought to supercross

8821480 anyone who had anything to do with randalls neighborhood or her gun range has their head on the chopping block i dont support that whatsoever
8821481 its just a stalling tactic on her part to force us to put in the budget what she wants to
8821482 were going to do a little more for different crowds
8821483 our new philosophy is that we have to compete against all bands not just certain bands thats how it is now
8821484 i hope they like it i think theyll like the music
8821485 these are the nastiest kids i have dealt with who go around hurting and beating people for some thrill
8821486 we accomplished what we wanted to come through the game healthy
8821487 now everything is pointed toward baltimore and thats most important its real bullets now
8821488 theres always room for improvement but overall i was fairly pleased with how it went
8821489 we wanted to make sure were at full strength for the opener
8821490 theyve had one week of practice the injuries theyre coming off of we dont want them to over stress their muscles

8821497 the reason we need a raise is that gas prices are going up grocery store prices are going up some guys out here have two or three jobs trying to make ends meet

8821505 amid dour re calibration of global macro forecasts and a dollar driven exodus
8821506 by year end portents of doom will likely shift to pro cyclical assessments if this is as bad as it gets thats pretty good
8821507 will likely remain rangebound awaiting either macro or supply demand catalysts
8821508 m amp a in metallurgical coal mid tier steel and quality mine developers
8821509 as recent additions were unable to offset depletion and 2007 08 demand growth we do not expect new projects to materially alter the severely constrained copper supply picture this gives minimum 2 years of visibility to supply adds with material downside from underperformance of operating mines due to labor strikes productivity issues pit wall failures etc
8821510 at face value there appears to be ready availability of copper geology projects delivered as advertised however we expect that a combination of frictional barriers limited supplies manpower and explicit factors political infrastructural and other site specific factors will result in further multi year delays among uncommitted projects
8821511 active m amp a in the past few years has seen the better projects move to the hands of capable developers strong cashflows of acquiring companies will help these companies secure financing despite tight credit market conditions
8821512 m amp a among gold developers has been less fervid than in copper
8821513 this is likely related to political factors tougher locations as well as commodity outperformance that provided copper mines excess cashflows plus better roi return on investment on projects
8821514 gold mines tend to show high cash margins but poor roi due to short mine lives
8821515 as such the wave of m amp a for gold developers has been less impressive with more current availability of single asset gold developers key examples that could be considered targets include osisko and detour gold in canada minefinders and mag silver in mexico guyana goldfields in guyana crystallex and gold reserve in venezuela and greystar resources in colombia among others
8821516 financing risks are a bigger concern for gold developers as the senior gold companies are less flush with cash than copper competitors this will likely result in more juniors attempting to go to construction with others banding together
8821517 where there is a greater variance in mine life more short lived operations
8821518 were investing in companies that are expected to growth significantly on the back of this strong economic growth
8821519 hi im brian williams thank you for joining us tonight
8821520 our first story tonight is from andrea mitchell who has learned that senator obama is indeed related to moses
8821521 also ahead nbc news correspondent lee cowan is traveling with senator obama and reports that he is a really big tipper and his teeth are perfect
8821522 continuing with our election coverage chuck todd will analyze exactly how michelle obama came to be so smart and good looking by the way my wife has a dress very similar to the one mrs obama wore on stage in denver she likes it a lot

8821539 i really gutsed it out today it was definitely a tough run probably the hardest i have run on the stairs so far mr mctaggart said

8821544 because i am not a know it all movie guru i will not hazard a guess about whether the movie will work at the box office but as a failed musician i would like to thank the makers of rock on for making such a sensitive movie with music as a metaphor for life
8821545 sumit can blow you away with his blues inspired guitar riffs on stage but off it he is a modest affable guy
8821546 dil chahta hai was a trendsetter when you look back paving way for storytellers who wanted a new story to tell
8821547 the biggest flaw of the film is that it has been treated like an english film to be honest it is too western for the indian masses to digest moreover in the post interval portions the story moves on three different tracks which are alien to each other

8821568 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8821569 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8821570 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles

8821581 theres been too little mentioned in the media and not enough attention during the convention on immigration reform

8821584 he turned his back on his own bill and does not support it as we think he should
8821585 as you know im a believer and ive never pretended not to be and i respect those who have no religious belief its a free country
8821586 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8821587 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8821588 if you were simply reducing that to mathematically probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8821589 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work
8821590 surely hes not working on two root canal patients at once
8821591 i believe westvilles future depends on infrastructure and commercial growth
8821592 but before major projects can be addressed we must regroup as a new council with fresh ideas and an eagerness to work at prioritizing immediate and future needs
8821593 i enjoy walking so hopefully i will not only get a lot of exercise but also come to know all the residents in my constituency and draw on their ideas and suggestions to make westville the prosperous town i know it can be
8821594 i very likely wouldnt be standing in invesco field to accept the nomination from my party
8821595 pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime i dont think we can shy away from the significance of that

8821598 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state guzman told reporters
8821599 this is a private organization and this guy freewheeler to be clear i was referring to the original post on lews site as maybe lacking relevance but i doug mataconis actually i got the impression that the blogger didnt understand the purpose of hoas and why
8821600 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8821601 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8821602 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8821603 the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8821604 weve run into them in states like oklahoma west virginia and maine during our fight for ballot access across the nation but if third parties are required to adhere to the law then we expect the same for the candidates of any other party maybe this will show republicans and democrats what it is like to be on the wrong side of ballot access laws
8821605 a nominee for a statewide office who received a number of votes equal to at least five percent of the total number of votes received by all candidates for that office
8821606 a mining convention will be drawn up for the exploration and exploitation stages of the project
8821607 solar has been slow to catch because its still the more expensive energy option
8821608 i would say this solar thermal heating is four to five times the cost of a conventional heating system
8821609 with our solar program they can lock in electricity rates for the next 20 years today
8821610 the reason they can do that because once the solar is installed the sunshine is free and maintenance is low
8821611 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
8821612 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8821613 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
8821614 in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
8821615 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8821616 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter
8821617 lapriss was told she could come back into the building and was escorted to the front of the line by another paragon security guard
8821618 nobody in that office felt her t shirt was offensive by any means
8821619 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
8821620 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
8821621 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
8821622 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
8821623 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
8821624 i had a really sick feeling to my stomach when i heard about these things that went on
8821625 i knew that my conscience couldnt allow me to go over there to iraq
8821626 i have a son i wouldnt be able to see its kind of hard to think about that
8821627 we would hope that the canadian government allow the men and women who refuse to fight a war that canadians also refuse to fight to stay up there especially after seeing the heavy punishment that robin long faces
8821628 veterans and war resisters are beginning to see that they are in the same boat that they are brothers and sisters and it is one struggle
8821629 the fact that people are showing this kind of solidarity with each other is really profound resistance within the military is certainly growing
8821630 i will remove tax breaks for companies that move overseas
8821631 theres like 20 to 25 percent ad libbing in the movie
8821632 thats a kevin smith line thats a seth rogen line
8821633 i think its our most visually interesting movie to date that seems to be the compliment from a lot of people including bob weinstein
8821634 theres a moment where we needed to showcase a pack of cigarettes at one point
8821635 hes just a dude in a suit hes not like superman
8821636 onomatopoeia would never go after superman whats the point you cant take him down but batman is a prey he can get his head around like if i can do this itd be great
8821637 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8821638 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8821639 i think everyone has a hurricane preparedness plan that we might not have had previously
8821640 weve got a command center now that is hurricane proof that was being constructed when rita hit so we do now have a secured command center where some of your emergency responders can meet
8821641 some of our customers are talking about having us work this weekend to get product into the supply line to feed their customers
8821642 one of the things learned from rita is that we have more advanced planning better communications and people are taking these storms a lot more seriously than we did in the past
8821643 trust me as soon as they even mention we start looking at it we watch everything down there and try to react as best we can each day
8821644 we are working toward a full evacuation of shell operated assets in the gulf
8821645 we expect to evacuate the remaining 600 personnel on friday and saturday
8821646 the process is comparable to a trip wire if it takes a plant 36 hours to empty its tanks of inventory and fill them with water and if the plant is in the storm arc 36 5 hours out shutdown procedures are enacted
8821647 these kinds of events are different just about every time and new variables can arise from the uncertainties that come with each storm
8821648 were better prepared to handle a catastrophe from an insurance point of view
8821649 there are just a whole lot of little parts to this situation that i am better prepared to handle
8821650 you are never prepared for a catastrophic event but we are better prepared
8821651 people think that if they survived katrina they can survive anything maybe maybe not

8821670 the fact that you write good songs and you sell too many of them if everybody in the world knew how to do that theyd do it its not something we chose to do
8821671 the fact was we got to a point that we were so big that tons of people were showing up at punk rock clubs and some clubs were even getting shut down because too many were showing up

8821745 that was the beginning of the most important changes before that everything was literal a direct representation of the battlefield with no way of abstractly representing behaviors
8821746 creating the foundations of mathematically driven warfare that would be programmed on computers in the 1950s
8821747 the rand corporation was working on a system to present theater level warfare in a form that would allow more mathematically accurate actions than those found on sand tables and board games of earlier centuries
8821748 thus was born the lasting tension between games as serious military tools and games as a form of entertainment
8821749 the players could focus on the tactical movements and leave the complexity of manipulation to the computer
8821750 incorporate mathematic and logical algorithms that were far beyond what could be managed with a human driven paper game
8821751 we are much more comfortable with using entertainment technologies for military training today
8821752 it was primitive but they showed the big idea of using games for training
8821753 as games have become more sophisticated and as the military has come to understand them better we have been able to identify better means of leveraging these technologies for serious purposes
8821754 we have come a long way in how we use games every year somebody takes it a stop further
8821755 soldiers are putting these cots games into their own hands and modifying them for their specific needs
8821756 we bring the system out to the field and create a gaming lab with a networking center
8821757 the soldiers just dive in and start playing the scenarios
8821758 then they start adapting those scenarios to make them more realistic they are not only learning the given scenarios but teaching themselves to replicate real life experiences to re live and recreate what theyve seen on their own missions
8821759 there is more of an acceptance of these technologies every year

8821768 with strong support from women blacks and younger voters illinois sen barack obama the apparent democratic presidential contender leads arizona sen john mccain expected to be the republican candidate among likely voters in florida ohio and pennsylvania
8821769 at a meeting in his pentagon office in early 1981 secretary of the navy john f lehman told capt john s mccain iii that he was about to attain his life ambition becoming an admiral mr mccain declined the prospect of his first admirals star to make a run for congress saying that he could do more good there mr lehman recalled
8821770 several months before my father died i informed him that i was leaving the navy i am sure he had gotten word of my decision from friends in the pentagon i had been summoned to see the cno admiral heyward who told me i was making a mistake his attempt to dissuade me encouraged me to believe that i might have made admiral had i remained in the navy a prospect that remained an open question in my mind some of my navy friends believed i could earn my star others doubted it when i told my father of my intention he did not remonstrate me but i knew him well enough to know that he was disappointed for when i left him that day alone in his study i took with me his hope that i might someday become the first son and grandson of four star admirals to achieve the same distinction that aspiration was well beyond my reach by the time i made my decision
8821771 that mccain was not going to receive a star and not going to become an admiral i think that was the deciding point for him to retire from the navy
8821772 no john mccain was not selected for flag rank for admiral
8821773 i have never heard a story even remotely that john mccain was going to be a flag officer i was early selected for captain in 1976 and i was regular selected for admiral in 1981 so its probably five or six years i guess ive never heard of anybody being selected for flag rank within three or four years of making captain ever
8821774 i made rear admiral in about five years i wasnt selected early and i wasnt selected late i find it incredible that someone made that statement that john lehman told john mccain he was going to be promoted to admiral two years after he made captain first of all telling him at all is not kosher but we all know the secretary of the navy does what he damn well pleases in particular john lehman this whole idea that john lehman told john mccain he was going to be promoted to flag two years after he made captain sounds preposterous to me
8821775 the airdales the air wing of the navy acted and still do as if unrivaled atop the naval pyramid they acted as if they owned not only the navy but the entire swath of blue water on the earths surface
8821776 a fter a european fling with the tobacco heiress john mccain reported to flight school at pensacola in august 1958 h is performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it what he loved was the kick the tire start the fire scarf in the wind life of a naval aviator one saturday morning as mccain was practicing landings his engine quit and his plane plunged into corpus christi knocked unconscious by the impact he came to as the plane settled to the bottom mccain was an adequate pilot but he had no patience for studying dry aviation manuals his professional growth though reasonably steady had its troubled moments flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral in 1965 he flew a trainer solo to philadelphia for the army navy game flying by way of norfolk he had just begun his descent over unpopulated tidal terrain when the engine died ive got a flameout he radioed he went through the standard relight procedures three times at one thousand feet he ejected landing on the deserted beach moments before the plane slammed into a clump of trees
8821777 in his memoir everything becomes a kind of game of adolescent brinksmanship how much can one press the limits of the acceptable and elude the powers that be the fighter jocks ethos of exaggerated almost aggressive sociability becomes an end in itself and an excuse for license there is a tendency for people not simply to believe their own mythology but indeed to exaggerate it fighter jocks like politicians around their campaign contributions often press the limits of the acceptable it is a type of mild corruption that takes place in a highly privileged atmosphere where restraints are loosened and excuses made mccain gives some hint in his memoirs about where he stood in the hierarchy among carrier flyers instead of the sleek and newer phantoms and crusaders mccain flew the dependable douglas a 4 skyhawk in an attack not a fighter squadron he was thus on the lower end of the flying totem pole

8821797 there will be 8 maidens carrying obama to the stage on a caravan and tossing grape leaves at him while 100 doves are released into the sky
8821798 why couldnt they have just cut it themselves save the postage and the tree why do they have to send me a letter and then jacki you know what they did a standard block format letter with my name and my address and then put to whom it may concern jacki they know who i am thats who they sent the damn letter too

8821803 senator clintons name must be put in nomination her supporters must be allowed to make speeches on her behalf of her candidacy there must be an honest roll call vote not a symbolic one so superdelegates can cast their votes honestly for either candidate as their judgment conscience and democratic principles dictate
8821804 is to insure substantive and legitimate selection of the nominee
8821805 should be taking responsibility for making sure its a legitimate procedure they cannot demand that people simply unify around either one of them
8821806 then the decision comes down to the superdelegates i have no idea what they are going to do six weeks from now
8821807 the new obama the new nixon and the same old new york times
8821808 the analogy of obama to nixon is valid from many different points of view since a case can be made that obama is the most underhanded and dishonest politician since nixon
8821809 we dont want history to remember the democratic national convention in denver as something that went smoothly

8821816 what i told a bunch of people a few weeks ago
8821817 is that while it would be nice if he decided he felt honor bound to stay within the system and take the money if he did so i might join a group of people who sued him for political malpractice when you have the ability to raise the kind of money that he could raise and do it without selling your soul to spend all the time between now and the election on fundraisers your goal is to win an election and not turn your back on the people voting there will be outraged editorials and mccain will be justifiably pissed but it was pragmatically the right decision for him to make
8821818 i dont think it was a slam dunk decision six months ago in part because people didnt have any idea what kind of reach he could have how many people he could bring into his camp
8821819 he has completely reversed himself and gone back not on his word to me but the commitment he made to the american people
8821820 another method to combat cynthias spiritomb is to just weaken it gradually with something like toxic or will o wisp and then finish it off with a potent attack before she can heal it

8821844 aku bahagia karena brian aku tahu dia akan berada di sorga aku tahu aku akan bertemu lagi dengannya
8821845 karena begitu besar kasih allah akan dunia ini sehingga ia telah mengaruniakan anak nya yang tunggal supaya setiap orang yang percaya kepada nya tidak binasa melainkan beroleh hidup yang kekal
8821846 time has a weird way of distorting itself when its an emergency
8821847 it felt like a long time but i was told it took only 10 to 15 minutes to get those guys off the mountain
8821848 mainly they had facial and hand burns and traumatic injuries
8821849 then we thought about the families of those who perished and those who survived
8821850 it is clear by this stage of the evenings entertainment that the barrel of stock army characters and situations has been tapped dry and the musical form is a means of recycling
8821851 romantic musical about the loneliness of a boy kept far away from his girl
8821852 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8821855 he will be president one day if he can keep his zipper zipped
8821856 after the reverend wright controversy hillary clinton had the nomination in her hands obama was suffering the worst press month of his campaign
8821857 then she had a choice she could have gotten bigger more presidential less political could have risen to defend obama this is outrageous and has no place in politics she didnt do that instead she chose to become smaller more political less presidential her own political instincts betrayed her
8821858 it looks like a big win for obama in north carolina and a narrow win for clinton in indiana
8821859 thats not good for hillary she needed a breakthrough a big win in indiana and a win or a narrow loss in north carolina it looks like shes not going to get either obama will add to his delegate lead
8821860 i can tell you right now what the clinton people will argue the battle goes on a fight to the death one delegate at a time never say die millions of democratic voters yet to be heard white working class people will vote for mccain instead of him blah blah blah
8821861 given that obama was already ahead and that there are now very few states remaining that is a very good night for him it is just what he needed to help turn around the media narrative
8821862 i have long viewed this in a simple way two things matter delegates and popular votes if obama wins both he cannot be denied the nomination if these numbers early returns hold up he will erase her gains in pennsylvania and have a near insurmountable popular vote lead that will do it and i expect a stream of superdelegates to move to him in the coming week plus
8821863 we respect john edwards but as the voters of west virginia showed last night this thing is far from over
8821864 for barack obama i think he ought to kiss johnny edwards on the lips to kill this 41 point loss
8821865 the story is not going to be the 41 point loss its going to be edwards endorsement
8821866 when hillary clinton broke through the glass floor and got down with the boys
8821867 sometimes doing the right thing is the hardest thing to do
8821868 holy crap shopko tricked me how could crappy box art not equal great gameplay see the original soul calibur halo and half life after having my buddy artimus chad join the game and selecting my 2 weapons out of 150 available in the game i was greeted with a super surreal experience

8821878 i wanted to post it here because i think its a great article and a great primer for those who may have grown weary of the creationist intelligent design discussions that have been wending their way through christian circles in one form of another for a very long time
8821879 does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith it does not it is a blunder to mistake the holy scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy geology biology and anthropology only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary insoluble conflicts as pointed out above the blunder leads to blasphemy the creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness
8821880 a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty these are not whiners they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint these are the americans that i know
8821881 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8821882 john mccain when i was a pow prisoner i didnt wear monochromatic clothes and when i spent five years in a pow camp i would have killed a guard to get a hold of a members only jacket or a pair of sweat pants when i was a pow i never worried about whether or not my shirt collar was tight enough to my neck as long as i had my cassette of abba oh wait nevermind
8821883 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8821884 i think shes a great artist ill say that whatever personal differences we may have had that got in the way of the music before it may be the very thing to make that impossible to happen on my end ill do it i can only speak for myself so i cant say if thatll ever happen again

8821898 john struggled most of the night especially early on but he kept making pitches when he had to
8821899 he kept grinding it out that was a big eight innings for us because we had a depleted bullpen
8821900 i told butch before the game to just leave me out there
8821901 it didnt matter if i give up 10 runs or throw a shutout ill suck it up and give the pen a day off i tip my cap to the boys they did some damage in the eighth
8821902 i told myself not to let the pitch beat me like it did wednesday night
8821903 they thought they had me on the ropes and started swinging early and often and that worked in my favor
8821904 we bring you heart felt greetings as these last days of august usher in baseballs most exciting time of year
8821905 as we watch our modern boys of summer evolve emerge and energize our city
8821906 we see a brand of civic enthusiasm families can only enjoy at the ballpark
8821907 the additions of casey blake manny ramirez and now greg maddux
8821908 bring substantial october experience to a team whose blossoming youth are developing before our eyes
8821909 we are grateful that ned colletti and his baseball operations staff
8821910 as we march through september in hopes of a long stay in october
8821911 we are filled with gratitude that these men have become a team
8821912 to help illustrate that appreciation we are inviting you to renew your commitment and renew your faith without an increase in price
8821913 while we must continue to grow our revenues to compete with our opponents
8821914 we are inviting you to renew your ticket plan for 2009 at 2008 prices
8821915 whether you enjoy the warmth of sun filled days or the majestic feel of enchanted evenings
8821916 we want to make this home your house of happiness

8821920 its not about who gets it done as long as it gets done
8821921 why was that happening amp what are you trying to tell me god
8821922 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand as well as the rate of domestic credit
8821923 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8821924 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8821925 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
8821926 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8821927 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points
8821928 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8821929 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8821930 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8821931 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8821932 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8821933 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8821934 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8821935 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8821936 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8821937 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8821938 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8821939 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8821940 the whole work of the enemy is to get you to go back to thinking that you are just an ordinary individual struggling on through life trying to make it the best way you can needing to mobilize all your human resources to try to get ahead of the other fellow and to achieve as much of the fulfillment of life as you can and anytime you believe that you go right back to acting as you once did back to the misery back to the heartaches you can escape that only when you come back again to this central truth we are alive in jesus christ
8821941 in cases where the murderer intentionally makes an action which is inherently lethal even if the murderer does not intend to kill the person
8821942 obama standing firm on solid ground standing in the battlefield
8821943 seriously though tonight obama gave hope to the hopeless and it looks like getting out of the hole that bush cheney mccain and their other cronies dug is no longer impossible
8821944 i am worried about bush and mccain purposely starting a war with iran and coming up with some bogus claim why he should remain president beyond his term limit
8821945 he then claimed that gun restrictions were compatible with the second amendment
8821946 the second amendment amendment ii to the united states constitution is a part of the united states bill of rights that protects the pre existing individual right to possess and carry weapons i
8821947 why would anyone vote to put either one of these domestic enemies of the constitution in the white house
8821948 this reminds me of that david allan coe song youre always singing
8821949 at her age she should have taken better care of her body
8821950 ya allah tolong abaikan puasa ummat muhammad apabila sebelum memasuki bulan ramadhan dia tidak melakukan hal hal yang berikut
8821951 to chairman dean and my great friend dick durbin and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8821952 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8821953 im just a mother who enjoys taking pictures of her family
8821954 put down the camera and stop taking pictures already mom
8821955 holy cow thats a great picture i cant believe you got that
8821956 because vocalists and the voice professionals that help them needto know exactly what is going on down there

8821960 shifting a little bit of media money back to those brands
8821961 kick in in a big way in 2009 and 2010
8821962 will be held in check at least for a while
8821963 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8821964 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8821965 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8821966 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free from discrimination
8821967 we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
8821968 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8821969 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8821970 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8821971 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8821972 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8821973 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8821974 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8821975 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8821976 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8821977 i should apply that confidence i have in yugioh to my personal life
8821978 i want to be buried with a fork in my right hand
8821979 my grandmother once told me this story and from there on out i have always tried to pass along its message to those i love and those who are in need of encouragement

8821985 was not the person that i met 20 years ago
8821986 she comported herself as if she were a jam making grandmother who scarcely knew her way in the world
8821987 i would like to put a point mrs green which has in all probability not occurred to you and yet which is so plain to those of us who are able to take the broader view my point is this
8821988 the terrifying joybelle morgan whose very curls seemed to tinkle like brass filings
8821989 leaving that aside you acted without authority and as a member of the administrative staff meddling with the equipment youve risked a strong protest from the unions i dont know what to say to you heads will roll he was a privileged speaker do you intend to do this sort of thing often
8821990 i hope we shant often be within measurable distance of invasion
8821991 the prose is rapid plain and unassuming with a fondness for dry wit and familiar allocutions there is little imagery and no recondite vocabulary obliquity timing and the virtues of omission and allusion are her secrets
8821992 lewis christens this skeptical reflux bulverism after its imaginary inventor ezekiel bulver lewis imagines the moment bulverism was born when five year old ezekiel heard his mother say to his father oh you say that because you are a man bulver intuitively grasped the stunning implication arguments need not be refuted only situated one rebuts a thought simply by calling attention to the genealogy or location of the thinker
8821993 take out san miguel company as the sponsor just put ginebra
8821994 chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive

8821997 saya yakin semestinya mereka menantikan detik ini yang mana mereka melihat kemasukan anwar ke parlimen selepas 10 tahun dinafikan hak pastinya harapan baru boleh diimpikan
8821998 rakyat menolak bn untuk memberikan kepercayaan kepada pakatan rakyat sebagai agen kepada perubahan saya pasti ia juga signal kepada pimpinan pakatan rakyat agar terus bersatu menjaga amanah yang mereka berikan
8821999 there was some concern that 6 months of treatment was insufficient
8822000 theyre going to think about this for the rest of their lives and its a tragedy where the child never had a chance maybe it can be a lesson for other people
8822001 i dont know why anyone would need a gun in this neighborhood
8822002 we need to put this issue with rand whitney behind us and we need to do this as soon as possible
8822003 we dont really play a role in how the town decides to take care of the judgment
8822004 somebody made a deal in 1992 thats come back to bite us
8822005 when you have a financial disturbance of this nature it becomes a black mark
8822006 if you create a financial crisis out of this that will affect your borrowing costs for a long period of time thereafter and thats the last thing you want to do
8822007 we owe it to the people of montville to finally allow the citizens to ask all the questions theyve been wanting to ask
8822008 she was hysterical she was just crying and crying and crying she wasnt able to speak
8822009 i saw a woman screaming an ambulance pull up and then they came out with a child on a stretcher
8822010 i dont know why it was out this morning he never let his kids near it
8822011 they loved their kids they would never do anything to hurt their kids
8822012 theyre just good people and it just makes it all the worse
8822013 he was like any other 2 year old he loved his movies he liked to play with his cars and he loved to play with his sister
8822014 you have to think about how the parents are feeling right now too
8822015 theyre going to blame themselves for the rest of their lives
8822016 i think hes going to give us the direction we need to take and i think we will be fine as a democratic party
8822017 they saved my life i was revived in an american ambulance i found out from a friend that the governor was coming here today i just came to show my support
8822018 on april 26 you fought the worst fire in the history of this great city
8822019 all of you placed the safety of others above your own there were children and the elderly and the disabled and there was not a single loss of life
8822020 we were told that there was someone still inside the building
8822021 we went up to the fire floor and i began searching i found her and i called out to lt smith we began pulling her out and others came to help thankfully this one had a happy ending
8822022 we felt we could probably be best served by converting that area into slots where fortunately theres demand
8822023 theyre also opening it up during the biggest gas crunch
8822024 thats what im hoping for anyways that they can pick up where they left off
8822025 something is wrong when i can fly across the country to las vegas even with the more expensive airfare for 11 days and save enough on my hotel bill that the total cost of transportation and hotel is less than going to foxwoods for a week
8822026 add in the cheaper food and more easily earned free food in vegas the nicer weather the free entertainment and the full pay video poker and these connecticut casinos cant compete as bargain destinations
8822027 we didnt see a reason to stop what were doing here on the casino side
8822028 and the expectation is that well meet or exceed that
8822029 im sure there are going to be people going over to see the new kid on the block just the same when we put up mgm grand
8822030 no one likes to lose a monopoly but we do live in a capitalist society and we can build our businesses
8822031 this is not just fill up a slot box and youll make money
8822032 home runs are harder to come by now in gaming typically you have to invest more the expectation of what a casino is now is different than from 10 years ago
8822033 we cant meet the demand for the hotel rooms on the weekend
8822034 theyre really redefining their market as a national rather than a regional market
8822035 theres no question that thats a very conscious strategy that they initiated years ago on the full anticipation that other states would authorize slot machines or casinos
8822036 yes that was great but its over now and does nothing for me to live in it or wish to relive even moments
8822037 yes im terrified of what is to come but why pay interest on a cow that has yet to be born

8822040 patients think they owe this money and it causes tremendous stress and anxiety for people
8822041 it is inappropriate to put the patient in the middle of this
8822042 they have a passionate base that they went after in a smart way
8822043 rights fees are up attendance is up viewership is up
8822044 somehow the strategy of putting baseball games on every device that has a plug or a battery has worked for the business partners even more important its worked for our fans
8822045 its much more than what you can get on television
8822046 it taps into the base by offering multiple camera angles stats and on demand video
8822047 its been a strain financially and from a credibility standpoint
8822048 this is an enormously complex program and that comes with a lot of risks
8822049 theyve spent more than four years modeling and testing and developing the systems for this aircraft but this is still an all new composite frame and all new electronic system architecture there are many different systems
8822050 there were certainly parts of our business where we were too aggressive
8822051 their products arent that differentiated they can paint their products in different colors or sell them in different geographies but a lot of the other players do the same thing
8822052 theres a less developed distressed debt market in europe with very few distressed fund players
8822053 banks and investment banks are having to sell things they wouldnt have sold in previous cycles

8822071 i doubt we can expect any of our current politicians to utter these words
8822072 the government owes filipino nurses five years worth of salary increases ra 9173 or the nursing act of 2002 which was supposed to upgrade the basic pay of government nurses from salary grade 10 to not lower than salary grade 15 has not been implemented year after year
8822073 resolution directing the house of representatives committee on appropriations and the committees on oversight and health to conduct an inquiry in aid of legislation into the failure of the national government to implement the upgrading of salary level of government nurses since the effectivity of ra 9173 otherwise known as the philippine nursing law of 2002 and for congress to include the corresponding budget needed for its implementation in the annual general appropriations
8822074 this is way below the monthly living wage for a family of six which has been pegged by the national wages and productivity commission at php 894 per day or php26 820 00 in a month
8822075 congress must make sure that necessary adjustments in the general appropriations act are made in order to accommodate the much delayed salary increase for filipino nurses
8822076 why does the guy need to read a 15 second congratulations does he not mean it
8822077 how perfect it is for you that you get to invoke one of american historys most iconic figures on your big night isnt that nice for you
8822078 we must work towards bringing these numbers down and congress can very well contribute to this by passing legislation that will make spread awareness on hiv aids prevention and management such as the reproductive health bill
8822079 addressing the issue of hiv aids inevitably entails the implementation of a comprehensive reproductive health and maternal and child care program as envisioned in the rh bill and in compliance with international standards set by the world health organization and the united nations
8822080 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them

8822083 peserta pemilihan umum untuk memilih anggota dewan perwakilan daerah adalah perseorangan
8822084 this means nothing to ordinary filipino women we do not take pride in having president arroyo tagged as the 41st most powerful woman in the world
8822085 president arroyos road to power was paved by massive controversies of cheating corruption extrajudicial killings and abuse certainly this is something filipinos cant be proud of
8822086 do our duty and i believe we can leave the rest most confidently in gods almighty hand and in so doing we will find ourselves walking along the same path of hope to that future which america promises not only to our children but to the children of all mankind not only to our country but as lincoln said to all the earth
8822087 we can make more in mobile than desktop eventually the reason is because the mobile computer is more targeted think about it you carry your phone everywhere it knows all about you we can do a very very targeted ad over time we will make more money for mobile advertising
8822088 there is a deliberate attempt by these companies to target indian users with advertisements that claim to help in the selection of a childs sex
8822089 if people arent bidding on keywords and are bidding on concepts it could completely change the ball game
8822090 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8822091 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8822092 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8822093 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8822094 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back

8822111 sebaik baik kalian adalah orang yang mempelajari al quran dan mengajarkannya
8822112 orang kuat bukanlah orang yang selalu menang ketika berkelahi tapi orang yang kuat adalah orang yang bisa menguasai diri ketika marah
8822113 puasa itu perisai diri apabila salah seorang dari kamu berpuasa maka janganlah ia berkata keji dan jangan membodohkan diri jika ada seseorang memerangimu atau mengumpatmu maka katakanlah sesesungguhnya saya sedang berpuasa
8822114 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta perbuatan az zur maka allah tidak membutuhkan perbuatan orang yang tidak bersopan santun maka tiada hajat bagi allah padahal dia meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
8822115 puasa ini bukanlah hanya menahan diri dari makan dan minum saja akan tetapi juga dari dusta dari perbuatan yang salah dan tutur kata yang sia sia
8822116 bicara dulu baru berpikir bukan sebaliknya berpikir dulu disaring baru diucapkan

8822122 yes i felt like dancing but had no intention of doing so
8822123 mary whirled me around on the marble floor and i just hung on with my eyes closed it felt good
8822124 at first i felt so self conscious i did not want to look goofy but it morphed into being my time i learned that i could just dance with my arms as mary moved me about the floor with grace and ease
8822125 after forty eight years of life i finally learned that even if life doesnt go my way i can still choose to dance in my heart i am choosing joy although my situation is not joyful god has given me good things and i am choosing to dwell on those not the bad
8822126 i had been down a lot even though i am in a wheelchair the music and dancing at the mayo helped me discover the choice of joy i am no longer fearful i am able to be free god granted me peace when i was so very sick
8822127 while i am dancing i spend time worshipping the lord
8822128 im so sick of when they say its just a phase youll be okay youre fine but i know its a lie the night is so long when everythings wrong
8822129 i associated much of christian doctrine with childrens stories because i grew up in church my sunday school teachers had turned bible narrative into childrens fables they talked about noah and the ark because the story had animals in it they failed to mention that this was when god massacred all of humanity
8822130 a long time ago i went to a concert with my friend rebecca rebecca can sing better than anybody ive ever known i heard this folksinger was coming to town and i thought she might like to see him because she was a singer too the tickets were twenty bucks which is a lot to pay if youre not on a date between songs though he told a story that helped me resolve some things about god the story was about his friend who is a navy seal he told it like it was true so i guess it was true although it could have been a lie the folksinger said his friend was performing a covert operation freeing hostages from a building in some dark part of the world his friends team flew into the room where the hostages had been imprisoned for months the room the folksinger said was filthy and dark the hostages were curled up in a corner terrified when the seals entered the room they heard the gasps of the hostages they stood at the door and called to the prisoners telling them they were americans the seals asked the hostages to follow them but the hostages wouldnt they sat there on the floor and hid their eyes in fear they were not of healthy mind and didnt believe their rescuers were really americans the seals stood there not knowing what to do they couldnt possibly carry everybody out one of the seals the folksingers friend got an idea he put down his weapon took off his helmet and curled up tightly next to the other hostages getting so close his body was touching some of theirs he softened the look on his face and put his arms around them he was trying to show them he was one of them none of the the prison guards would have done this he stayed there for a little while until some of the hostages started to look at him finally meeting his eyes the navy seal whispered that they were americans and were there to rescue them will you follow us he said the hero stood to his feet and one of the hostages did the same then another until all of them were willing to go the story ends with all the hostages safe on an american aircraft carrier i never liked it when the preachers said we had to follow jesus sometimes they would make him sound angry but i liked the story the folksinger told i liked the idea of jesus becoming man so that we would be able to trust him and i like that he healed people and loved them and cared deeply about how people were feeling
8822131 wait did i order yarn and totally forget about it

8822167 how in the end did they not perceive that to try to spiritualize religion to the point where it subsists devoid of all external manifestation is tantamount to claiming a reform of the work of god the great and sublime artist who in creating the universe and mankind revealed himself as the omnipotent eternal and infinite poet architect musician and sculptor

8822220 gasification has a lot of potential because the technology is well established and can process a very wide range of feed stocks
8822221 it has the greatest potential when you can process waste
8822222 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them
8822223 only when the last tree has died and the last river has been poisoned and the last fish has been caught will we realize we cant eat money
8822224 someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago
8822225 i think both of us teams lost chances to close the game in regulation
8822226 it was a test of character for the boys im happy they held together rather well
8822227 im proud of the way my bench rose to the occasion
8822228 i must also give credit to the taipei team for the way they came back
8822229 im proud of my boys for the way they fought back
8822230 i hope the boys take the lessons from this game into the next matches in the tournament
8822231 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8822232 i am only bleeding to death but yea i am fine
8822233 with no disrespect intended the game was a lot closer then it should have been because annas head coach has his impossible anatomical act deleted and tried to throw the ball instead of running it
8822234 you just go ahead and print that say that its my fault its all on me everyone will know it is true my kids overcame it all they are so good
8822235 they lehman played hard too but i really think that the turnovers and the kickoff return hurt them badly
8822236 it was a tough loss for the team and the fans
8822237 anna came out in the second half and established their running game on the other hand we never got going on offense in the second half
8822238 asking the kids to win the last eight games of the season to make the playoffs again this year is asking a lot milton union is good we have our work cut out for us
8822239 were seriously disappointed but were not disappointed in the kids effort they never quit and they showed that by being competitive late into this game
8822240 they could have let them score again at the end of the game but they didnt do that were proud of our kids
8822241 hes an 11 1 100 meter man too hes the best athlete at our school he can high jump 6 foot 2 he can run and he is starting to understand what he is being asked to do
8822242 he wright is really good but he isnt the only good blocker we have
8822243 justin carr eric neikamp alex hohlbein joey bell zach christman and marcus schemmel kept me clean all night
8822244 it makes my job not only easier but possible good offensive results start with good blocking
8822245 our schedule and our season werent conducive to getting us playoff ready
8822246 from 1987 to 1997 in particular we had terrible economic growth
8822247 by the time we reached 1999 we were way behind the u s in per capita incomes and everything else
8822248 when i was working as an assistant professor in california i was making 55 000 but in canada that magically becomes 70 000

8822250 unlike solar and wind we can run this plant night or day summer or winter
8822251 the best part of the u s for growing trees
8822252 we have no need and no intention to go after anything that the forest products companies would be using in their production
8822253 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them

8822291 i collect spiderman stuff and i used to collect bugs until they all died
8822292 how do you expect them to sell at a cheaper price when they bought the maize at a much higher price
8822293 those who need the maize will continue coming to us and we will go by our terms i bought the maize at a high price and cannot accept anything less than the price i want
8822294 it is obvious that smallholder farmers will not grow enough maize because they will not make any profits i believe that farmers who have maize should continue selling to a trader who is offering more money
8822295 a throwback to an era of failed state control over food markets
8822296 an organ of the state and thus politically motivated which adds another level of concern
8822297 modern states typically work to reduce monopoly and monopsony power when a buyer controls a large proportion of the market and drives prices down to level the playing field for farmers consumers and traders this is a move in the opposite direction reconcentrating market power in the hands of one organisation
8822298 would do better to focus on providing the physical and institutional infrastructure necessary for private small traders to blossom grow and compete with one another to offer the best prices quality and service to farmers and consumers alike
8822299 since january we have been buying maize at prices that were not justified at all
8822300 with admarc as the only buying and selling point we are assured of enough maize at an affordable price
8822301 they the traders sold us our own maize at exorbitant prices for no good reasons
8822302 they started the speculation that there is no maize when we were told by government that there is enough to feed us till the next harvest all they wanted was to sell at high prices
8822303 here i release you it is what is best for you
8822304 we have witnessed in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of barack obama as the democratic partys nominee

8822307 its not that he doesnt get it its that he cant sell it
8822308 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the americans who deserve it

8822316 the authorities want to control online sharing so that dissidents cannot express themselves it is sad to see the internet space being shrunk in this way
8822317 many blogs had been closed down but bloggers have been able to debate by creating personal pages on facebook
8822318 we are honoured to be part of the 100 years as it the cruise 100 years ago put forward the us as a world power he said

8822321 they go to hotels so they dont have to wear flip flops in the shower and shower or sleep around other people he said
8822322 i can confirm that he is interested in investing in air botswana and we have invited him to come to botswana to make his proposal to government

8822337 hold your fire until you see the whites of their eyes
8822338 i have been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years
8822339 hes a solid guy not the sizzle and spice pick but a good solid guy who can do the job hilarys done too much damage mccain would just put on a tape of obama and clinton talking against each other and never leave the house plus hes head of the foreign relations commitee i like him
8822340 the fact is al qaida and the taliban the people who actually attacked us on 9 11 have regrouped in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoed baracks call for more troops john mccain was wrong barack obama was right should we trust john mccains judgment when he rejected talking with iran and then asked what is there to talk about or barack obama who said we must talk and make it clear to iran that its conduct must change now after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to advance our security again john mccain was wrong barack obama was right should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8822341 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8822342 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance
8822343 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8822344 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america for fox news that missed this part of the speech i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8822345 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8822346 this enables france in conjunction with other financial donors and in particular the member states of the european union to demonstrate our commitment to the reinforcement of the rule of law and democracy in the drc
8822347 this support falls under the continuity of our support to the electoral process which began in 2005 with the constitutional referendum and continued in 2006 with the presidential legislative and provincial elections
8822348 this process will not be complete without the last stage which consists in setting up democratically elected institutions at the local level without the local elections and the rooting of the process in the villages and territories one cannot fully establish a democratic system in this country
8822349 he will follow bin laden to the gates of hell but wont even follow him to the cave where he lives does anyone understand that line
8822350 to the people who dislike it it has a whiff of shaming your own country and they really dont like that
8822351 jon h i think mccain said something about following bin laden to the gates of hell and obama was contrasting his ignoring afghanistan with that
8822352 he will follow bin laden to the gates of hell but wont even follow him to the cave where he lives does anyone understand that line
8822353 if youre not angry youre just stupid you dont care
8822354 i dont disagree with the substantive issues here im just not sure the rhetorical stance will work
8822355 the republicans dont know how to react to this yet
8822356 let us not have a large election about small things
8822357 there is a god how the worlds most notorious atheist changed his mind

8822369 you know this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8822370 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8822371 an evolving breed of city dweller for whom keeping green is every bit as important in their romantic life as in their choice of household cleanser dinner food or wall paint
8822372 i want to challenge the stereotype of green people as being all pot smoking hippies
8822373 i used a range of dating sites none were focussed on that niche and you couldnt screen out who was green it was my preference to meet someone who shared an interest or passion in environmental issues
8822374 a dynamic interesting social networking site for sustainability including dating targeted for people who care about green issues
8822375 we havent had anyone go on a real date yet
8822376 when you talk about urban cities like vancouver that have a high percentage of people that care about green lifestyles the idea of being able to find someone else who shares your own values is enticing
8822377 there is a market where people are so green its like theyre actually a different race
8822378 my ideal green date would be if my date asked me to meet them somewhere outdoors wed take our bikes and meet up for a ride maybe end up on the beach where wed have a meal out of tupperware containers
8822379 nobody has ever fallen in love with no 2 plastic
8822380 a filter process like that doesnt necessarily get you what you want at the end of the day those kind of values are on your bonus list theyre not what will hold you together
8822381 sustainable healthy non toxic dating isnt about being fear based and making choices based on keeping out the bad
8822382 whether its how a person dresses how much money they make those are filter processes that dont really get you what you want
8822383 its tiring always having to stand up for your beliefs and back it up
8822384 if they werent totally green but were open to making changes sure id date them
8822385 i would want my date to prove to me that hes really green
8822386 naples keggers do it right sunny days and wasted nights
8822387 noooo and i give him a blank stair my supervisor forgets that i dont have a formal merchandising background
8822388 im just surprised so and so hasnt called i mean these numbers arent right so now the report for the company is off by m
8822389 ow well i guess well have to fix it next week when we have to turn the report in again

8822395 history shows that the artwork spans almost a century from world war i to operation iraqi freedom but its most notable period was clearly in world war ii and korea this was a time when the military commanders were more flexible in boosting the morale of the pilots and crew and werent as concerned about political correctness during the crews most dangerous and deadly war efforts

8822399 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8822400 once it has been deemed safe specialist search teams and forensic experts will go in
8822401 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8822402 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8822403 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside

8822406 i used a range of dating sites none were focussed on that niche and you couldnt screen out who was green it was my preference to meet someone who shared an interest or passion in environmental issues
8822407 a dynamic interesting social networking site for sustainability including dating targeted for people who care about green issues
8822408 we havent had anyone go on a real date yet
8822409 when you talk about urban cities like vancouver that have a high percentage of people that care about green lifestyles the idea of being able to find someone else who shares your own values is enticing
8822410 there is a market where people are so green its like theyre actually a different race
8822411 my ideal green date would be if my date asked me to meet them somewhere outdoors wed take our bikes and meet up for a ride maybe end up on the beach where wed have a meal out of tupperware containers
8822412 nobody has ever fallen in love with no 2 plastic
8822413 a filter process like that doesnt necessarily get you what you want at the end of the day those kind of values are on your bonus list theyre not what will hold you together
8822414 sustainable healthy non toxic dating isnt about being fear based and making choices based on keeping out the bad
8822415 whether its how a person dresses how much money they make those are filter processes that dont really get you what you want
8822416 its tiring always having to stand up for your beliefs and back it up
8822417 if they werent totally green but were open to making changes sure id date them
8822418 i would want my date to prove to me that hes really green
8822419 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8822420 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think
8822421 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten per cent chance on change
8822422 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
8822423 its just another spin on the same old thing again
8822424 america fuck yeah coming in to save the mother fuckin day fuck yeah
8822425 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8822426 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8822427 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8822428 well i thought but you werent having that at the time
8822429 im trying to figure that out what the hell is this about suki what have you done what is going on here
8822430 she wants joseph moorer dead hero you should have let me kill him a long time ago jocepticon
8822431 i was told to slit his throat im not going to do that im sure theyll make up
8822432 well well i thought you lost your life to valen tyine massacre super hyper villain i see old habits die hard or in this case dont die hard and if im not mistaken you were summoned here i mean you cant just come back unless the bond bons brought you here or the magnifisin 7 created you from another being
8822433 youd be amazed at what you can live through hatos
8822434 wait the fuck a minute we can go somewhere else and finish this i have a lot of questions where is joseph moorer why was i sent here in the first place
8822435 and what in the fuck are you even doing here lets go now
8822436 not a fucking word to anyone until i get this cleared up
8822437 scrappy doom villain does not look like she should be fucked with
8822438 its just another spin on the same old thing again
8822439 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8822440 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8822441 just because i have nerves doesnt mean that i can feel i wasnt very much fun to be with anyway just let the blood run red because i cant feel
8822442 this bird can understand me and is doing things for a reason
8822443 its just another spin on the same old thing again
8822444 the populations that bear the greatest burden nationally blacks for example and men who have sex with men are highly represented in new york city
8822445 because hiv is more prevalent within those groups the risk of hiv infection per sexual contact is higher
8822446 this is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading hiv

8822448 i didnt have a clue you could go into 15 000 debt in one night
8822449 when i saw that bill i was just kind of numb
8822450 two thirds of the people who go into medical debt have insurance
8822451 when medical debt hits it hits very quickly its a jolt and its generally not very predictable
8822452 the most dangerous thing people do when they get into debt is ignore the statements and notices
8822453 they think doctors and hospitals wont send them to collection agencies but they absolutely will
8822454 i had a client once who was charged for a surgery she never had
8822455 another one was charged more than 5 000 for disposable gloves
8822456 people think they have to pay the amount on the bill but doctors and hospitals are very willing to negotiate
8822457 she could afford to pay 4 000 so i told her show them a certified check for 4 000 she did and told them this is all i have in the world and they took it
8822458 my whole life ive tried to be smart with money
8822459 now ive had to empty out my 401 k to pay for all this
8822460 dont take a no from the customer service representative on the other end of the 800 number
8822461 i used to run hospitals so i know how these things are priced
8822462 just because a procedure costs 10 000 at one hospital doesnt mean you cant find it for 5 000 down the road
8822463 patients need to learn to be a lot smarter and a lot savvier about their health care
8822464 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8822465 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8822466 no other country on earth is my story even possible
8822467 that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles
8822468 few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
8822469 together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth
8822470 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8822471 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8822472 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8822473 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8822474 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact
8822475 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8822478 is that the first half of the movie is extremely good almost to the point where one would think this is classic
8822479 isnt necessarily a bad film i was easily admit that i expected quite a bit more especially when you consider that
8822480 as a decent way to spend 2 hours but only throw this movie in if theres nothing else to watch otherwise youve seen this before folks

8822483 from his new friend dragline and the name just seems to stick with him
8822484 speaking of that line ill admit going into this that was how i knew this film as i had never seen it before in its entirety
8822485 as i just said was a film id never seen but knew of its legendary status after my father telling me it was worth the watch i gave it a chance what resulted was that i was totally pleased with what i got in the 2 hour runtime the movie is that just as the legendary critic
8822486 is a prison movie that should be given the chance just as the case for our main character
8822487 which might sound awfully generous for a mono track but i did find it to contain no distortion and hold a very retro cinema feel to it
8822488 has recently been known for including a joke about the previous
8822489 we wanted to do a fake documentary about the making of the movie within the movie which is called tropic thunder not the actual movie tropic thunder
8822490 the fake documentary focuses on the real movies fake director and what happens to the fake cast before they go into the real jungle its pretty straightforward
8822491 was groundbreaking for the independent film community when in 1985 it was the first independent film to receive an oscar not to mention the performances of the cast are absolutely amazing with
8822492 is a headliner now and should be given more projects also worth noting are some more of the supporting cast like
8822493 i just dont imagine ill be revisiting this one again die hard

8822495 for overall video quality and is sure to leave the fans pleased glad to see
8822496 for overall audio quality and id be lying if i said i didnt expect a little bit more but im still happy with what we get here
8822497 to just name a few during the opening of the film when main character is painting in his workshop youll notice some of his
8822498 if old beliefs die hard go kevorkian on them bitches

8822504 i ate a raw pork chop in a filthy toilet in calcutta and was perfectly fine enthroned for a week

8822532 we are in the hat which is great it is another two legged affair but it would be great to get through to the group stages
8822533 it would be great if we can sustain the progress we have made in the premier league
8822534 that is so important but why not do well in europe as well
8822535 if we could get a couple more people in before the transfer window closes on monday and we are trying everything to do that it would give all of us a lift and maybe sustain us for the months ahead
8822536 i have to emphasise again how delighted i am that gareth is staying i am ecstatic but so is the dressing room
8822537 it is a big lift for us it feels like we have a new player a few weeks ago i thought gareth would have gone by now
8822538 it was a question of getting the job done i was hoping we would sustain the tempo of the game longer than we did
8822539 but having scored four goals in iceland and having made a few changes im just so pleased to have got through
8822540 to also have 25 000 people turn out with the game live on television was also staggering it was really terrific for us
8822541 you know im sorry about what happened and i take responsibility for my part of it
8822542 its not that im not interested in the boy its just that weve got a couple more years before hes at that point
8822543 i know ive been thinking about that too we can meet in and we can stay at and the kids can go to
8822544 pennsylvanias former deputy attorney general and sen hillary rodham clinton supporter philip j berg has filed a lawsuit in federal court in pennsylvania accusing presumptive democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama of lying about his u s citizenship which would make him ineligible to be president
8822545 the suit filed in u s district court in philadelphia last week also names the democratic national committee and the federal election commission and says mr obama s mother went to kenya late in her pregnancy and ended up giving birth there it also claims that later in life mr obama declared himself a citizen of indonesia

8822552 somewhere along the line i said hey do you want to come to the big house and play a game

8822579 the shanghai cooperation organisation sco members decided not to go for extremes when reacting to russias actions in the caucasus in a restrained manner and without recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia they did side with their partner
8822580 russian officials assured that in closed meetings sco colleagues voiced full understanding of russias position but could not acknowledge it openly due to internal reasons
8822581 the most important thing was that sco confirmed russias chief role as peacekeeper in the caucasus
8822582 in a practically consolidated anti russian stance the west took moscow still got support for its actions in the caucasus from beijing and other sco partners
8822583 though it may not have looked as convincing as the kremlin might have liked such is the eastern nature of sco diplomacy where everything has to be read between the lines and found in significant gestures and smiles
8822584 though this is trivial east is east and west is west and the twain are in no hurry to meet
8822585 the sco voiced full approval of moscows actions but in the final declaration it still spoke in favor of territorial integrity and against use of force this means that in the growing standoff with the west russia is practically alone
8822586 there was no unequivocal condemnation of georgias strike on tskhinvali no joy on recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia and one can even find hidden displeasure with moscows actions in some formulas
8822587 all sco members have problematic regions and if one country recognizes the caucasian republics claims to its own territory will follow
8822588 the russian side was in principle ready for such a turn of events
8822589 this whole story where the leaders united in refraining from public statements on an issue that is critically important for one of its members shows that the sco is indeed unlikely to become a powerful military and political alliance to rival nato

8822596 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8822597 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8822598 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went
8822599 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
8822600 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
8822601 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
8822602 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
8822603 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
8822604 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
8822605 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays

8822615 el juego especulativo del aragua fc con defensa cerrada pero sin profundidad en el ataque fue superado abiertamente por el visitante chivas de guadalajara que con mejor t ctica y determinaci n se impuso anoche en el estadio hermanos ghersi 2 goles por 1

8822624 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8822625 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8822626 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8822627 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8822628 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8822629 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8822630 chris smelley did come in and play very well well have to wsatch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8822631 i went out there and gave it everything i had
8822632 id like to play next week its the thing ive been working for well see how it goes
8822633 basically a tough start the game was fine until the last series we fumbled the ball at the half the first series of the second half we let it gete away from us
8822634 i thought we played ok its not time to start breaking out the champagne or anything
8822635 for those who dont know zains its a normal procedure with any problem
8822636 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8822637 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast
8822638 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8822639 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8822640 if the us economy were growing at its potential pace the unemployment rate would not have risen a full percentage point over the past year
8822641 this was a surprisingly strong report that should end the discussion about a recession at least for now
8822642 but we are almost two thirds of the way through the third quarter and the focus of attention is now on the future not the past that does not look to be quite as good as what we had in the spring but not terrible either if we can only get housing prices in the weakest areas to start stabilizing we could get the financial sector back on board and growth could pick up
8822643 there are already some signs that the impact of the tax rebates is starting to wane going into the third quarter and expectations that it will be totally spent by the fourth quarter
8822644 the support to exports from the earlier depreciation of the us dollar may be more long lived although the greenback is starting to trend higher more worrying on the trade front near term are indications of weakening growth overseas
8822645 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8822646 when girls play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8822647 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis she managed to stay calm and to play the same until the end
8822648 today i didnt feel it thumb im just happy to be back on track without pain
8822649 now all i have to do is put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard
8822650 i won a grand slam and i was playing really well
8822651 obviously im not playing like a number 1 now probably not
8822652 but i cant judge that because i really havent had chance to practice this loss is just an incentive to work harder
8822653 i have the possibility to maintain number 1 for a long time and to win another grand slam i was just a little unfortunate with injury and i just have to go back on the court and keep working hard
8822654 the market is being driven more by external factors the drop in oil prices and the us economic numbers that were released overnight
8822655 youd be surprised that notebook computers sales are growing three times more than desktop pcs

8822665 if anything gold promises to remain volatile in the near term gold price movements will continue to reflect the ups and downs in the us dollar euro exchange rate
8822666 well probably trade in a range of 830 to 840 despite some positive news such as rising oil prices it may be difficult to crack the 845 and 850 resistant levels because there are not many participants in the market
8822667 ive noticed that indian housewives are far better forecasters of the gold price than most of us paid to do the job and today indian housewives are buying the yellow metal
8822668 fortuitously physical demand has picked up sharply in the past month particularly among retail investors weve seen this in india where jewellery demand has picked up early in response to low prices ahead of the coming festival season

8822672 nie wird ein politiker in sachsen mit der npd stimmen
8822673 auf keinen fall und auf keiner ebene eine auch nur irgendwie geartete zusammenarbeit
8822674 wenn die npd den wolf im schafspelz macht d rfen die demokraten das nicht mitmachen
8822675 nat rlich kommt keinerlei zusammenarbeit mit der npd in frage
8822676 wenn in gruppen einzelne sch ler gemobbt werden l schen wir das sofort
8822677 frage nicht was dein land f r dich tun kann sondern was du f r dein land tun kannst
8822678 es ist besser in ein t pfchen zu machen und dann reinstecken

8822689 por eso esta marcha tiene sentido y por eso acept la invitaci n para participar
8822690 tanta gente a favor de la justicia y de la reforma migratoria y de la dignidad humana
8822691 en realidad nuestras fuerzas entraron en la zona del conflicto despu s de que rusia desplegase sus tanques en nuestro territorio al pasar a trav s del t nel roki hacia osetia del sur
8822692 si mosc puede retirar al gobierno de georgia elegido democr ticamente entonces puede intimidar a otros gobiernos democr ticos europeos d nde termina todo lo que sabemos de rusia especialmente del actual r gimen no es alentador
8822693 si mosc trata de derrocar nuestro gobierno con la utilizaci n de instrumentos letales entonces hay que resistir con los instrumentos democr ticos que han mantenido la paz euro atl ntica durante m s de sesenta a os
8822694 apoyar a georgia con instituciones pol ticas y financieras de europa es una respuesta poderosa
8822695 todo m xico puede colgarse de esta medalla pues es fruto de un trabajo en equipo de nosotros los deportistas as como de todas aquellas personas que nos apoyaron y que creyeron en nosotras

8822698 there would not be great scope for us to improve our final ballpark figures
8822699 we didnt make any offers but weve been trying to explore what ballpark might be able to find agreement
8822700 we indicated a 21 month agreement was the appropriate duration and a significant pay pause and a pay increase in low single digit figures
8822701 its very difficult to see what can be done to secure a deal as the economic situation is deteriorating by the week and i believe the government needs to get the social partners to a shared consensus of the problems confronting us and a shared consensus of the solutions
8822702 clearly economic policy pay policy and labour market policy are terribly important in the context of our competitiveness and productivity both of which have suffered
8822703 companies need to be able to get change more easily than in the past and need to be able to improve productivity and make cost off setting measures where necessary
8822704 partnership has worked very well for the country in difficult and good times and we should give it a very fair window to help us through the current difficulties which are very serious
8822705 includes an attractive portfolio of leading added value dairy and meat product brands
8822706 siptu members have already contributed savings worth 11 million a year to the airline as we demonstrated earlier this year making savings and improving competitiveness can be achieved without pay cuts
8822707 there are no current proposals under which bcm puts eircom up for sale its not a market to be selling assets in
8822708 in the current market youre very unlikely to realise the potential value in eircom by putting it up for sale
8822709 certainly its possible that babcock brown will cease to be the manager of bcm
8822710 given that they earn substantial management fees theyre unlikely to give it up for free
8822711 are they happy to have the noise that surrounds babcock brown my guess is that the answer to that is no
8822712 it really started with big corporations and weve seen slowing in state and local government spending small to medium sized businesses as well
8822713 this is due to market covering some corporate dollar demand which we saw late yesterday
8822714 the current account data prompted investor reluctance to buy the won
8822715 the dollar ringgit was higher because there was month end us dollar demand and fundamentally because the central bank did not raise rates to contain inflation
8822716 this moa will have to drastically amend the constitution correct
8822717 indigenous communities have the right to participate fully in all matters affecting their lives
8822718 the government would be obligated to amend the constitution to conform with the contents of the moa
8822719 the state cannot raise as a defense for not complying with international law the fact that the document violated the constitution it will be obliged to change whatever is inconsistent with international law
8822720 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8822721 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8822722 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead
8822723 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8822724 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8822725 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8822726 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8822727 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8822728 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8822729 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8822730 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8822731 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8822732 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8822733 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8822734 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8822735 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8822736 greenpeace water patrol is taking action by closing down this waste dump this mound of garbage clearly pollutes laguna lake there should never have been a dumpsite here in the first place and there should be no more excuses about cleaning it up immediately
8822737 by continuing to treat laguna lake as a rubbish bin it is obvious that the local government of angono lacks sincerity and political will to protect their own water resources the dumpsite is in full operation despite common knowledge that it is violating environmental laws and polluting the lake
8822738 la partie non accessible par les moyens terrestres est toujours active cest cette partie qui progresse deux tracker venus de carcassonne viennent darriver sur zone quatre pelican quatre tracker et un dash en provenance de marignane bouches du rh ne sont attendus vers 8h30

8822742 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8822743 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8822744 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8822745 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8822746 democrats fear that mccain will choose a candidate with personality charisma and depth a candidate who will overcome mccains long list of shortcomings
8822747 im very eager to get out there and play and show what ive wanted to do since i came to college which is be the starting quarterback for boston college
8822748 i think it will be really telling and i think the fans will finally be able to see what we are capable of with me as a quarterback and the different things we can do
8822749 i dont think the one game will define me as a quarterback but itll be a good starting point
8822750 i went out there and i wanted to see against a good defense what i could get away with how hard i have to push to get the ball down the field
8822751 i learned and i think it will be beneficial for our season that you dont have to push the ball down the field to gain yards
8822752 there are times when you have to fit the ball into tight spaces and i learned that it can be done but you need to pick your battles
8822753 thats my biggest unknown i knew how matty performed last year in practice but now im not sure because its a different style
8822754 i would say it was toward the middle to end of camp where it was like you know what its his team and he realized it im the quarterback this is my team im in the drivers seat i really felt that during the middle and end of camp was the defining moment
8822755 he was more talkative in the huddle pointing guys out where we need to get better it just kind of happened and we went along with it
8822756 i can safely say hand on heart that i have not been given the nod just to clear that up once and for all and stop the nonsense thats been in the papers the nonsense from the players talking
8822757 im disgusted that people players media basically think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional to have done such a thing a week before a number of different scenarios could have actually happened
8822758 the game is a bit erratic to be honest with you ive been working hard on my swing but struggling to put it together
8822759 if tiger was not around and i was able to be the no 1 player in the world id be making half as much as i am now because of him
8822760 i am very thankful that hes in our sport and hes had the success the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8822761 we all miss him the ratings have suffered as well as attendance and so the game of golf suffers when hes not in the field i think we are lucky to have the most recognizable largest icon in all of sport playing ours
8822762 im still not ruling out the possibility with a little bit of work of trying to get there
8822763 but im just saying were all fortunate that woods really does exist
8822764 it was a fun tournament and i loved the opportunity to have won and the way it happened with three rounds with tiger
8822765 it really is a wonderful golf course i think its our best tpc course
8822766 its one of the most fun to play as well as challenging and this year its in exceptional condition just like it was last year
8822767 i love the opportunities to make birdies and the opportunities to make big scores which gives guys who are playing well more opportunities to separate themselves from the field
8822768 he said there was only one person i ever wanted to marry
8822769 our first wedding anniversary is coming up this sept 28
8822770 that he had three to six months to live if he did not get any treatment
8822771 if he did receive this horrid treatment he would have a 30 percent chance of living five years
8822772 and he said no thanks and quit working and bought a boat and he lived on his boat on the gulf of mexico for two years sort of waiting to die
8822773 and then it recurred in 2006 just before he and i reconnected
8822774 so i knew he was sick and i knew it wasnt good but i loved him
8822775 there was nothing else to do but spend every minute together and thats what we did
8822776 worked as an electrician carpenter lighting director and sound engineer
8822777 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8822778 i think that some greens drain better than these theres no question
8822779 so well have to look into that at a future date
8822780 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8822781 she had a strong passion for the development of israel
8822782 at the age of 15 i joined a social club whose organizer was a zionist bernard cohen
8822783 from time to time he taught us about palestine as a homeland for the jews
8822784 i volunteered to act as a temporary secretary for a zoa chapter
8822785 our store and our home were known as the zionist store and the zionist house people came to us to send money to israel
8822786 the construction industry remains strong with major projects in southern nevada while consumer spending faltered in the month of june
8822787 our states more recent economic trends are anticipated given the state of the national economy
8822788 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8822789 what i hope happens is the country doesnt forget the jubilation and excitement thats been generated here
8822790 and i hope it turns into something that changes the world
8822791 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8822792 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8822793 hey cool ship whats this button do aggghhhhhh hey where are we now
8822794 hey general landry we found something that the science guys are going to want to take a look at
8822795 well weve arrived with this team of scientists and military support guys hey cool ship boy i can hardly wait to get home to my wife and kids hey whats this button do aggghhhhhh hey where are we now i miss my wife and kids
8822796 ich mache seit ber vierzig jahren radiophone st cke die f r mich genau so wichtig sind wie die geschriebenen weil ich ganz fr h entdeckt habe dass meine stimme mit zur substanz meiner poetischen arbeit geh rt die eigentliche radiophone arbeit konnte beginnen als die stereophonie erfunden wurde das war in den sp teren 60er jahren seitdem habe ich rund 14 h rspiele machen k nnen die auf der basis der stereophonie zu realisieren waren f r mich war es ein enormes erlebnis jetzt die neue technik dolby digital surround kennen zu lernen und praktizieren zu d rfen wir begeben uns da in eine dimension der stimmerfahrung und stimmproduktion die auch von der stereophonie nicht erreicht werden konnte weil ich als sprechender wie als h render in einem akustischen zentrum bin das homogen ist mit meiner stimmleistung und stimmf higkeit in diesem sinne haben wir das st ck k m ein vogel geflogen konzipiert und realisiert ein st ck das mit den beweglichkeiten welche die neue technik erlaubt arbeitet und dadurch stimmqualit ten und worterfahrungen erm glicht die bisher nicht zug nglich waren k m ein vogel geflogen
8822797 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8822798 we all know that its a more difficult environment to get credit i dont think theres any doubt about that but we also know that the banks have just announced what are for most of them still record profit levels
8822799 so if the reserve bank cuts rates as i hope that they do i would expect all banks repeat all banks to pass on those cuts to customers
8822800 if some banks choose not to do that then i think youll see a competitive market environment
8822801 consumers will exercise their choice and i think if any bank didnt you would see consumers who would shop around in the market to get a better deal and thats a healthy thing
8822802 these changes are necessary to address the challenges confronting b amp b power going forward
8822803 its time that started to be emphasised because clearly theres a difference
8822804 if youre partly owned by a particular lender what product are you likely to recommend
8822805 is it in a consumers best interest to deal with a broker that is owned by a lender
8822806 its in the lenders interest that the broker encourages a borrower to keep a loan for as long as possible
8822807 youd have to wonder if someone was partly owned by the bank what their level of independence is
8822808 the less players in the market the less competition consumers are going to have to look hard for true independents
8822809 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8822810 the sale of the hallet 2 wind farm is consistent with the companys integrated strategy dr fraser said
8822811 we are very pleased with this outcome especially in light of the current credit market environment
8822812 the transaction certainly demonstrates there is a solid appetite for quality projects of this nature which deliver benefits to both parties
8822813 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead
8822814 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit mr smirk said
8822815 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8822816 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8822817 you know a great new career would be to form a band with a bunch of other guys whove had their legs blown off
8822818 holy crap that guy vishnu has a lot of arms and heads
8822819 the work currently being performed to finalise the full year result and prior period adjustments arising out of a re assessment of accounting treatments is substantially concluded and will be finalised as soon as possible it said in a statement
8822820 parents should feel reassured that current events have no effect on the day to day running of our centres he said in a statement
8822821 we appreciate the significant role our services play in the lives of all of our families and the provision of a safe educational and fun environment for the children remains our number one priority
8822822 its very much a tainted product now mr elvish said yesterday
8822823 i think it would be very unlikely that someone unless they were prepared to get it at a bargain price and then spend a lot of money on rebadging and remarketing and all the rest of it will get it back to credibility i cant imagine it staying as one group
8822824 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering cabin adjacent to the second main cabin doors the atsb report says
8822825 im anxious to see what kind of reaction i get
8822826 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8822827 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8822828 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8822829 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8822830 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8822831 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8822832 we are going to have a team here next september
8822833 section ill bet you didnt know that an enormous collection of cropped off pics of female olympic athlete a es qualified as satire these days
8822834 on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8822835 we believe we are the only ones in the country doing something like this on this level
8822836 its downtown its a historic area its run out of a bike shop and its free
8822837 i regret the harm this has caused my family my friends and this community
8822838 we can put it on a rack in the rail car and get things out of it
8822839 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
8822840 im going to wait and see what happens with the storm
8822841 for her peace of mind im going to board up her windows
8822842 we where tired of getting yelled at all the time
8822843 we didnt think they would think a teacher would do it we are so sorry to miss romonison she should not be in trouble for something we did we wont do it no more
8822844 there were a couple of the jurors who had decided already that she must be guilty because she was arrested and it was in all the news
8822845 i believe in the interest of justice that a new trial should be granted
8822846 i believe the verdict at trial would have been different
8822847 if this were the standard all you would need would be someone writing an anonymous note to the judge or the defense attorney to get a new trial
8822848 indian people are dying across this country from inadequate health care
8822849 it seems as though they believe a certain number of native american people are expendable
8822850 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8822851 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice
8822852 to understand why marginalized populations are at higher risk of infection you have to recognize that these groups often do not have equal access to housing education health care clean drinking water or nutrition
8822853 marginalized groups also face discrimination and have less control of funding streams for health and social welfare purposes
8822854 enjoy rights and a quality of life much higher than do people in other nations
8822855 legal system acknowledges constitutional and civil rights but not human rights
8822856 void when it comes to advocating for the right to quality health care for everyone
8822857 without equal access to quality health care the epidemic will border 0 gt
8822858 and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me
8822859 cares of this world and deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things
8822860 as part of our preexisting policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8822861 if a customer uses more than 250gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8822862 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand
8822863 unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve
8822864 als opperbevelhebber zal ik nooit aarzelen deze natie te verdedigen
8822865 maar ik zal onze troepen alleen aan gevaar blootstellen met een duidelijke missie en een heilige verplichting hen de uitrusting te geven die zij in de strijd nodig hebben en de zorg en beloning die zij verdienen als zij thuiskomen
8822866 wij kunnen het beter doen dan de afgelopen acht jaar
8822867 als opperbevelhebber zal ik nooit aarzelen deze natie te verdedigen
8822868 was trots geweest op barack obama trots op de partij die hem heeft genomineerd trots op het amerika dat hem zal kiezen
8822869 het is de eerste keer dat we dit doen maar de stijl van ons eten zul je zeker in deze tapa terugvinden we willen de stempel van ons huis doordrukken daarom hebben we gekozen voor een speciale smaakcombinatie op het menu gemarineerde zalm in papillot met shii take bosui sojascheutjes en een fris slaatje van frisee limoen en chili
8822870 vanaf twaalf uur kun je eten vier uur later ben je hoogstwaarschijnlijk te laat want op is op
8822871 een tapa kost vijf euro vier tapas samen krijg je voor 20 euro een tapa komt samen met een aperitief pastis of sinaasappelsap ijs chocolade en een duvel of bru water voor wijn moet je bijbetalen met een maximum van twaalf euro per fles
8822872 regen en wind houden het evenement niet tegen de barbecue komt er sowieso we zetten tenten op en er is de stedelijke bescherming
8822873 de am biance zal heel relaxt zijn het gaat om de emotie van het moment lekker eten hoeft geen financieel exclusieve gelegenheid te zijn we willen dat iedereen voor weinig geld de mentaliteit van die grote chefs kan proeven je zult die koks ook kunnen aanspreken en vragen stellen daarnaast krijgt iedereen die vijf euro uitgeeft aan een tapa de verschillende recepten mee naar huis zo kun je het thuis nog eens rustig uitproberen
8822874 what i cant figure out is why she and the others got such a large raise when all she did was ask why this guy was being paid more
8822875 you cant pay men more than women for no reason
8822876 er waren toen massaal huisbezoeken om huisjesmelkers te vatten maar vele illegalen zijn toen ook opgepakt en uitgewezen we wisten niet wat ons overkwam
8822877 de meeste ecuadoranen willen hier blijven ze moeten zich dus zo goed mogelijk integreren we komen van een ander land een vreemde cultuur we moeten leren wat hier de gewoonten en de normen zijn onderwijs is de belangrijkste sleutel tot integratie de kinderen die hier naar school gaan spreken frans en zijn goed ge ntegreerd
8822878 ecuadoranen zijn werkmensen wij komen hier om te werken niet om van de sociale zekerheid te genieten maar met de nodige papieren zouden we meer bestaanszekerheid hebben
8822879 in spanje zijn een tijdje geleden veel ecuadoranen geregulariseerd en daar loopt de integratie vlot in brussel is dat een stuk moeilijker omdat veel mensen geen papieren hebben wij nemen het op voor die mensen en stimuleren hun integratie
8822880 wij zetten de ecuadoranen aan om mondiger te worden in ecuador zijn ze gewend op straat te komen en te roepen voor hun rechten hier gebeurt dat niet uit vrees voor represailles we zijn er intussen wel in geslaagd de mensen te groeperen om samen te betogen in groep durven ze het wel door solidair te zijn zullen we slagen in ons opzet regularisatie
8822881 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8822882 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8822883 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8822884 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8822885 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8822886 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8822887 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8822888 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8822889 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8822890 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8822891 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8822892 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8822893 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8822894 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8822895 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8822896 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8822897 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8822898 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8822899 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8822900 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8822901 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8822902 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8822903 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8822904 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8822905 there must be some national crisis of self esteem for us to push so hard for these medals otherwise why would you need it
8822906 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8822907 killings and torture committed by military security forces protecting and paid for by
8822908 is the owner of a swimming pool insulated from liability per se for a lifeguards negligence simply because the lifeguard is required to be there surely not
8822909 there would still be issues of negligence in hiring or supervision and of control the exact issues disputed here
8822910 sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse
8822911 there is evidence that these security forces committed the alleged atrocities that exxonmobil of indonesia paid for the security which was provided
8822912 assisted in the management of security affairs on behalf of
8822913 went up the chain and request ed additional corporate kinds of support
8822914 the poor reputation of the indonesian military especially in the area of respecting human rights and in their predilection for rogue clandestine operations
8822915 it sends the signal to u s companies operating overseas that they cannot expect to facilitate and permit these kinds of abuses in the countries where they are operating and escape without punishment we intend to hold exxon mobil accountable for horrible acts committed by their security on their watch that they could have and should have prevented
8822916 exxonmobil condemns human rights violations in any form and has actively expressed these views to governments and others around the world
8822917 the claims are based on the alleged conduct of the indonesia military against citizens of aceh in aceh during a civil conflict there is no claim that an exxonmobil affiliate participated in any human rights violations or any other wrongdoing
8822918 amazing wonders of the world kingdom of the west yellowstone yosemite amp glacier national parks
8822919 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8822920 when obama is elected that means nobody will ever ask again do you think texas is ready
8822921 just because hes running people will be more confident about african americans in leadership roles
8822922 to me this is a tremendous moment for young people
8822923 they never knew segregation but they know what we went through to get to barack obama
8822924 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
8822925 im going to wait and see what happens with the storm
8822926 for her peace of mind im going to board up her windows
8822927 i think most people here are prepared and are ready to leave if they have to but some people with the high gas prices might have to ride the storm out
8822928 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8822929 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8822930 ill bet you it was someone connected with the army air forces
8822931 they had to have the materials to make this and i doubt somebody in the infantry would
8822932 the officers brought it in and didnt give it a second thought
8822933 it was just a gun theyre in their 20s and 30s to me it runs a little deeper i recognized immediately that the photo was from the 40s
8822934 if we can find the woman then we can find out who the man was who owned this gun
8822935 id like to find the nearest museum near them and put it in there with his and her whole story
8822936 and if i can find out where it was stolen then i can put a case on the guy we took it from for stolen property thatd be good too
8822937 i dont want to put other people down because the finger could be pointed at me too but there are some huge staff weaknesses when it comes to not putting budgets together or not approving them correctly
8822938 ultimately the budget would be the managing directors job but we didnt believe he had the skill set in that job
8822939 i would certainly go if people thought i should step back
8822940 i didnt think it was working i made those feelings known
8822941 but it is not one persons ballet company the president or the chairman doesnt run the ballet
8822942 but having a balanced budget on paper is not the same as being financially stable
8822943 robin was a participant and attended every finance committee meeting since i became managing director so was ben stevenson she had full and complete reports during that entire period
8822944 our call volume has kicked up from some of our lenders looking for another source for down payment help
8822945 those programs were not part of the solution they were part of the problem
8822946 we began to see a pattern in seller funded dpas where if we had to foreclose the property value was not worth what it was when we made the loan
8822947 were back to core programs like the 97 percent financed fha mortgage
8822948 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8822949 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8822950 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
8822951 in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8822952 for those of us who stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial or who in the years that followed may have lost hope this movement and this moment is a testament to the power and vision of martin luther king jr
8822953 were all children of the dream and he is in all our hearts and minds
8822954 but not only that he is in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8822955 who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps
8822956 marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8822957 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks celebrities lead but this has been mine
8822958 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8822959 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8822960 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8822961 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8822962 spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8822963 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8822964 and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day sen
8822965 om ze te kunnen presenteren in juni moet je je programma afsluiten in februari de deadlines volgden elkaar dus snel op daarom alleen al is het geen overbodige luxe om dit met twee te doen een huis dat zo groot is als het kaaitheater kun je niet in je eentje leiden we programmeren in alle disciplines van de podiumkunsten zowel nationale als internationale kunstenaars zowel jong talent als gevestigde waarden dus is er heel veel wat je moet opvolgen
8822966 dat wordt weleens gezegd maar ik constateer toch dat de bezoekersaantallen zeker niet slecht zijn de podiumkunsten hebben het niet gemakkelijk om op te boksen tegen de concurrentie in de vrijetijdsindustrie maar ze doen het zeker niet slecht
8822967 waar we wel veel over nadenken is op welke manier en hoe snel we nieuwe artiesten kunnen presenteren steeds meer artiesten beginnen op steeds jongere leeftijd werk te maken los van de bestaande structuren dat aanbod is gefragmenteerd maar kwalitatief hoogstaand toen ik mijn eerste festival in utrecht samenstelde moest ik nog zoeken naar interessant nieuw werk terwijl de keuzes vandaag soms behoorlijk moeilijk zijn
8822968 het kaaitheater kan kunstenaars niet meer van a tot z begeleiden maar blijft wel inspanningen leveren we steunen artiesten die niet structureel gesubsidieerd worden zoals jan decorte kris verdonck of mette ingvartsen en we willen nog meer op zoek gaan naar andere partners om coproducties en samenwerkingsverbanden op te zetten die samenwerking hoeft niet tot de vervaging van ons profiel te leiden performance heeft bijvoorbeeld net zo goed links met de beeldende kunst als met de podiumkunsten voor ons festival performatik werken we dus samen met partners als wiels argos en cc strombeek die daar al sterk in staan
8822969 als er nu iets is waar me voor het kaaitheater in brussel een specifieke opdracht lijkt weggelegd dan is het dat internationale maar ook daar is het kiezen want de wereld is groot geworden kunstenaars komen niet meer alleen uit de vs en japan maar van overal
8822970 dat heeft minder met onze eigen interesse te maken dan met het feit dat die themas ook steeds meer naar voren kwamen in het werk van de artiesten volgens ons verdient dat soort werk dan ook een groter publiek en vooral veel context die context kun je leveren in programmaboekjes en nabesprekingen maar met spoken world kozen we voor een jaarlijks festival waarbij artiesten rond deze themas werken en wij voor de theoretische achtergrond zorgen in de vorm van een programma met debatten lezingen en evenementen
8822971 bij deze eerste spoken world is dat programma er automatisch omdat we van 9 tot 12 september mee de zesde editie van het internationale interdependence day forum organiseren een vierdaagse van debatten met mensen van over de hele wereld waar ook heel wat andere brusselse instellingen bij betrokken zijn daar zullen we voortdurend het globale met het lokale verbinden en gaan we bijvoorbeeld op stap in molenbeek om ons door de inwoners te laten gidsen en samen een ramadanmaal te gebruiken
8822972 dat mogen ze gelukkig nog altijd doen maar de vraag naar duiding wordt ons wel degelijk expliciet door het publiek gesteld het gebeurt dat mensen iets interessant vinden zonder dat ze meteen weten waarom nu precies artiesten die met wereldproblemen bezig zijn presenteren daar uiteindelijk meestal een gesublimeerde en geabstraheerde analyse van de vraag hoe de artiest die ruimte achter de harde feiten en opinies opzoekt kan zeer interessant zijn
8822973 ons programma rond de amerikaanse choreografe anna halprin is een ander voorbeeld van omkadering centraal staat daar een reconstructie van een stuk uit de jaren 1960 en met la raffinerie verbinden we daar een programma van films en workshops aan maar ook de specifieke vragen van scholieren willen we beantwoorden er zullen interviews met artiesten op de site staan en als ons nieuwe onthaal caf restaurant klaar is moet dat een echte ontmoetingsplek worden voor artiesten en publiek een plek ook waar je na de voorstelling blijft hangen
8822974 het wordt zeker dit najaar en ik heb het gevoel dat die nieuwe ruimte veel zal veranderen alle functies ingang onthaal kaartjesbalie foyer en restaurant komen in dezelfde ruimte dat geeft extra mogelijkheden
8822975 de bedoeling is opnieuw een staalkaart van ons aanbod te tonen tegen zeer democratische prijzen veel artiesten die later op het seizoen een nieuwe productie maken tonen eerst nog een bestaande
8822976 in het eerste weekend beginnen we ook met matinee kadee en kunnen ouders zondag om drie uur naar een matineevoorstelling terwijl er opvang is voor kinderen van nul tot drie en een workshop voor kinderen van vier tot twaalf en we sluiten shuffle af met een fuif
8822977 eh you guys do realise that dbkl should take t
8822978 well if shes a sex symbol the worlds gone w
8822979 despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
8822980 but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves it should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8822981 doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8822982 i dont know what kind of life john mccain thinks celebrities lead but this has been mine
8822983 ive got news for you john mccain we all put country first
8822984 what i will not do is suggest that mccain takes his positions for political purposes
8822985 because one of the things we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging one anothers character and patriotism
8822986 he saved it until the very end but didnt take the easy path the dream stuff but worked it more subtly
8822987 let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8822988 such things happen and were santana not so laissez faire about his role and his responsibility so patently dismissive of his duty to dominate it would have been just another game problem is santana does not yet seem to understand that with a 137 5 million contact in your pocket and the words new york striped across your chest attitude and swagger are requisite the entire concept of team needs to be put on hold because aces win games by themselves
8822989 since the house price bubble has burst weve had to write off 10 trillion pounds so weve desperately been looking for somewhere else to lose i mean lend money
8822990 having researched agriculture thoroughly weve decided that farmers whove enjoyed a huge rise in their farmland values without any corresponding increase in their income are a perfect target for increased lending
8822991 it now requires a second mortgage for a farmer to buy a single tonne of fertiliser let alone a lorry load so theres obviously going to be demand for additional lending to provide farmers with additional working capital
8822992 as a bank were happy to match fertiliser purchases tonne for tonne with piles of borrowed cash as we like to say at sub prime inc spread the lending risk like manure three feet deep across every farm in the uk
8822993 if you removed the sfp from uk farmings trading account the underlying profitability of the industry as a whole is absolutely zero but banks cant afford to get bogged down with such fine details
8822994 isnt well schooled and prepared to be president of the united states
8822995 i called on monday requesting a statement from the aclu about accountable americas intimidation campaign against gop donors what is the aclus position with regard to such efforts waiting for your statement
8822996 michelle my apologies that i cannot be of more assistance but we dont have anyone available thanks pam
8822997 pam does this mean you dont have anyone available today this week or for the foreseeable future
8822998 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8822999 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8823000 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8823001 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8823002 van in het begin voel ik me hier op mijn gemak en dat is altijd zo gebleven brugge mijn geboortestad is heel mooi en ik kom er nog graag terug maar ik zou er niet meer willen wonen te veel drukte op een zakdoek te veel toeristen bovendien is er nog steeds zoveel m r te ontdekken in brussel
8823003 ik doe alles zonder auto te voet met het openbaar vervoer het autorijden laat ik aan mijn echtgenote catherine over
8823004 met mijn vrouw die afkomstig is van oostende deel ik al 27 jaar lief en leed in brussel alexander en sofia zijn hier geboren en voelen zich goed als brusselaars al van kleins af aan vriendjes en vriendinnetjes hebben ze nooit gebrek gehad het frans geen sta in de weg toen de tijd rijp was hebben we hen naar frankrijk gestuurd voor een taalbad wat hen zeer heeft geholpen ze hebben zich aangepast net zoals ik dat gedaan heb toen ik in 1965 ben beginnen te werken bij de brt in flagey ik kon ook moeilijk anders in het groot symfonisch orkest van de rtb brt le grand orchestre symphonique de la rtb brt waren de meeste van de collegas franstalig ik heb ook wel iets met talen zo heb ik een jaar of vier italiaans gevolgd in het volwassenenonderwijs aan de vub hoe meer talen hoe beter en hoe liever het is verrijkend zonder meer
8823005 ik benijd haar niet het is een enorme verantwoordelijkheid maar liefst 2 700 leerlingen zowat 130 leraars ook alexander en sofia hebben talent onze zoon heeft cello leren spelen onze dochter viool en allebei kunnen ze uit de voeten op de piano maar op een bepaald moment hadden ze geen zin meer in muziek en zijn ze een totaal andere richting ingeslagen alexander is afgestudeerd als tv regisseur aan het rits en gaat nu managements en pedagogiecursussen volgen sofia heeft een diploma management toerisme aan de erasmushogeschool en wil daar nu nog een jaar hotelmanagement aan vastkleven in elishout in anderlecht
8823006 mijn vader was dirigent van een harmonie de liefde voor de muziek wilde hij doorgeven aan zijn drie zoons en zijn dochter daarom werden we naar het conservatorium van brugge gestuurd fagot zei me wel iets maar er was geen leraar voor dat instrument daarop heeft de directeur me voorgesteld de hoorn ter hand te nemen het was niet mijn bedoeling daarin een carri re uit te bouwen maar na de middelbare school kwam de vraag wat nu wat ga ik doen in het leven en omdat gebleken was dat het musiceren me heel goed af ging heb ik beslist daarin verder te gaan en heb ik me ingeschreven aan het conservatorium van gent ik heb in die jaren ook contrabas leren spelen niet zonder vrucht tijdens mijn legerdienst in zellik heb ik nog op het jazzfestival van comblain la tour gespeeld naast grootheden als john coltrane een onvergetelijke belevenis
8823007 toen ik opnieuw een vrij man was kon ik zowel aan de slag in een muziekkapel van het leger in de opera van gent als bij de toenmalige brt de keuze was snel gemaakt als schooljongen had ik de gebouwen van de brt mogen bezoeken met die befaamde studio 4 ik was danig onder de indruk en dacht bij mezelf hier zou ik graag ooit spelen die wens is werkelijkheid geworden en ik ben het huis trouw gebleven tot aan mijn pensioen
8823008 ontelbaar de goede herinneringen die ik eraan heb overgehouden vooral aan de jaren dat de brt en de rtb nog samen zaten in flagey in dat prachtige omroepgebouw je kon van de ene producer naar de andere lopen met voorstellen voor opnames van muziekuitvoeringen klassiek hedendaags dat is helaas allemaal met de jaren afgebouwd in zoverre zelfs dat miel van attenhoven die onlangs helaas overleden is de enige was die de voorbije jaren bij de vrt nog muzikale producties verzorgde miel was overigens ook de drijvende kracht achter jazz middelheim
8823009 nadat ik catherine had leren kennen hebben we eerst een vijftal jaar gehuurd op het sint katelijneplein een gerenoveerd appartement van de stad brussel maar zodra de kinderen er waren was het niet meer te doen we woonden op de hoogste verdieping en er was geen lift dus zijn we op zoek gegaan naar iets om te kopen met als voorwaarden niet te duur dicht bij het werk en niet te ver van de autosnelweg omdat catherine in leuven werkte
8823010 tussen twee diensten door had ik altijd een paar uur vrij en kon ik wat rondkijken
8823011 zithoek en keuken hebben we bijgebouwd sanitair elektriciteit allemaal vernieuwd de rest hebben we opgeknapt met respect voor wat er was er is genoeg comfort voor vier en we hebben de luxe van een tuintje voor als het mooi weer is
8823012 dat bijna vanzelfsprekende gemak waarmee de aanpassing aan het leven in brussel is verlopen heeft wellicht te maken met het feit dat steden me nooit hebben afgeschrikt integendeel door de muziek heb ik betrekkelijk veel mogen reizen een flink stuk van de wereld gezien en dat ontdekken is me steeds goed afgegaan bovendien hebben andere culturen me altijd aangesproken en op dat vlak heeft brussel me meer dan op mijn wenken bediend samen met het feit dat er achter elk hoekje wel een verrassing schuilt maakt het dat hier van alles te beleven valt veel meer dan in om het even welke vlaamse provinciestad
8823013 brussel is een beetje een eiland in belgi we staan gelukkig nog steeds een beetje buiten het extremistische discours dat zowel in vlaanderen en walloni steeds meer opgeld maakt het is echt beschamend wat er nu allemaal gebeurt in de nationale politiek een tijd geleden zijn we naar frankrijk geweest en toen hebben we een concert bijgewoond in cluny met op het podium een ex collega na het optreden praatten we wat bij en zodoende kwam ik in contact met de organisatoren ah vous tes de la belgique en hoe zit het daar nu ik was beschaamd durfde het zelfs niet uit te leggen maar in brussel valt het allemaal nog mee zeker aan de basis al zijn er natuurlijk ook de politici verschillende van hen hebben het nog steeds niet begrepen bijvoorbeeld een milquet die bij een of andere opening in het hortahuis in het frans speecht en het nederlands links laat liggen zoiets kan natuurlijk niet
8823014 soms erger ik me wel maar niet fanatiek dat is alleen maar tijdverlies maar als er n ding is dat ik wel zou willen zien veranderen dan is het de hopeloos onpraktische constructie met die negentien gemeenten e n burgemeester dat zou ik graag zien e n en maak van die gemeenten arrondissementen zoals in parijs daar in die miljoenenstad werkt het waarom zou het dan niet kunnen werken in brussel met maar n miljoen inwoners alles zou veel vlotter verlopen
8823015 e n burgemeester dus n een beter cultureel beleid ik kan maar niet snappen dat het zo versnipperd blijft in feite is er geen cultuurbeleid het is alsof alleen brussel stad belang heeft waarom niet die andere gemeenten betrekken bij zoiets als brupass bijvoorbeeld het museum in elsene dat is prachtig daar loopt op dit ogenblik een heel interessante tentoonstelling van affiches van toulouse lautrec maar het is amper of niet bekend
8823016 ook etterbeek zou op cultureel gebied veel beter kunnen scoren ik heb het al voorgesteld aan de verantwoordelijke schepen maak het jourdanplein autovrij en poot daar een grote kiosk neer waar concerten kunnen worden gegeven als er muziek is komt er altijd volk op af en het hoeft allemaal niet veel te kosten ons belgisch leger heeft drie muziekkapellen ze zijn alle drie goed de grootste is de muziekkapel van de gidsen die traden vroeger regelmatig op op de grote markt dat was schitterend feesten en barbecues het is allemaal leuk en het moet kunnen maar er moet ook plaats zijn voor cultuur in frankrijk is er zelfs in het kleinste dorpje ruimte voor neem nu cormatin niet ver van cluny een boerengat van welgeteld n straat en een kasteel in een grote schuur bij dat kasteel hebben ze een theatertje waar muziek van kurt weill wordt uitgevoerd en theaterstukken van moli re worden gespeeld
8823017 ik ben zeker niet in een zwart gat gevallen musiceren doe ik nog amper als ik berhaupt nog speel dan is het enkel en alleen om kennissen een plezier te doen in de harmonie van asse bijvoorbeeld die heel goed werk levert maar de meeste van mijn activiteiten zijn sociaal cultureel ge nga geerd ik zit onder meer in de raad van bestuur van het gemeenschapscentrum de maalbeek in die van de gepensioneerden van de vrt en van de vzw beeldenstorm een sociaal artistiek project in kuregem gesticht en geleid door nik honinckx daarnaast ben ik ook voorzitter van de raad van bestuur van de kunsthumaniora in laken niet dat het mijn ambitie was ik ben erin gerold omdat ik gevraagd ben
8823018 beeldenstorm dat volgend jaar tien jaar bestaat heb ik echt zien groeien het fleurt de achtergestelde buurt op en houdt kinderen van de straat bij de maalbeek is mijn dada hoe kan het anders de muzikale programmering klassiek maar ook hedendaags het is niet altijd makkelijk om de mensen te overtuigen maar voor mij komt het erop aan kwaliteit te brengen en bijvoorbeeld kamermuziekgroepen te programmeren die weinig of geen kans krijgen om in het psk te spelen
8823019 ook in de kunsthumaniora steek ik met veel plezier tijd en energie met de nieuwe directeur is het een bloeiende school geworden er zit werkelijk schwung in de jazzafdeling begint goed te marcheren er is hedendaagse dans bijgekomen bovendien blijft het leerlingenaantal stijgen wat betekent dat we selectiever te werk kunnen gaan we hebben ook nogal wat leerlingen van buiten brussel het internaat zit bomvol er was al plaats voor zestig leerlingen nu komt er nog accommodatie bij voor twintig extra internen
8823020 dankzij de raad van bestuur van de gepensioneerden van de vrt kom ik dan weer geregeld in contact met oude bekenden en kan ik hun brussel en ons cultureel leven wat beter leren kennen de meesten onder hen zijn allerminst brusselkenners de ene keer troon ik die mensen mee naar een tentoonstelling in bozar de andere keer op een tour van brukselbinnenstebuiten grappig bij een van die tours zijn we op mijn initiatief langs beeldenstorm gepasseerd zelfs voor de gids was dat een ontdekking alweer een bewijs dat brussel zelfs voor wie de stad kent altijd verrassingen in petto heeft
8823021 al wat niet te zwaar of te groot is vind je op de trein we hebben zelfs al een beenprothese binnen gekregen en af en toe een kinderwagen dan vraag ik me af of dat kind plots heeft leren lopen ooit vonden de collegas twee duiven in de bagage van een treinreiziger die mens moest zonder zijn duiven naar engeland vertrekken de duiven sturen wij dan naar een asiel of een duivenmelker
8823022 daarna komen ze in de bewaarplaats terecht voor een periode van zes maanden een wet uit de jaren 1800 bepaalt dat na een halfjaar worden de intacte goederen openbaar verkocht de rest vernietigd
8823023 daar betaal je volgens de waarde van het voorwerp wat meestal duurder uitvalt
8823024 we ontvangen hier meer en meer gps systemen daarnaast hebben we maandelijks twee bakken vol met gsms waar mensen dan vaak nog niet naar komen vragen o ja hier staat onze microgolfoven ook gevonden en heel praktisch voor onze dienst zes maanden lang
8823025 we hebben al enkele echt dure dingen binnen gekregen waaronder een viool van 7 500 euro en een projectieapparaat van toentertijd 140 000 frank 3 500 euro en voorts al eens een golftas met clubs
8823026 het merendeel van de goederen die naar hier gebracht worden zijn gestolen het is dus niet altijd de eigenaar die zijn goed op straat verliest
8823027 je hoort hier de waanzinnigste verhalen ons werk heeft ook een sterke sociale dimensie mensen die een carjacking meegemaakt hebben kunnen hun verhaal hier kwijt en dat appreci ren ze
8823028 niemand weet wat er in zon lot zit dat kunnen lege portefeuilles zijn maar evengoed afrikaanse maskers
8823029 ze krijgt een brief met vermelding van de eigenaar de gevonden voorwerpen en dat ze ze kunnen komen afhalen elk land wordt op die manier op de hoogte gebracht sommige landen pikken niets op andere staan hier wekelijks de goederen opsturen kan niet wat als dat verloren gaat onderweg
8823030 it is therefore encouraged that the minister agrees with us that the cost of living has increased as a result of high food and petrol prices and that the lack of adjustment of the means test to make it in line with inflation had diminished the value of the grants more especially in purchasing the basket of goods and services that is mostly consumed by the poor
8823031 this is indeed a step in the right direction especially in these hard times
8823032 eh beh ma queste cose possono succedere soltanto a cuba o in cina
8823033 nome coniato anche con una certa accezione dispregiativa facendo riferimento ad unazione politica che servisse a migliorare le condizioni di vita della classe lavoratrice senza per rivoluzionare strutturalmente il capitalismo
8823034 lopposizione ha tutto sic la grande stampa la magistratura gli enti locali oltre le alte cariche dello stato eppure noi abbiamo la maggioranza ma e una maggioranza silenziosa attenzione a non farla esplodere
8823035 we are excited to announce the release of ubuntu christian edition 4 0 ubuntu christian edition has been on hold for quite a while for various reasons but we are back up and running
8823036 more than 40 000 are living in government run camps
8823037 we have seen panic weve seen sorrow weve seen despair hundreds of people screamed to us from rooftops as we floated by
8823038 but there are simply too many people to rescue and too few boats to do so people were literally screaming waving running with suitcases in water trying to get to us
8823039 we agreed on 2 000 rupees and he upped it to 2 700 61 just like that
8823040 its raining here people are on rooftops begging to be rescued
8823041 we are hungry were thirsty we have to drink something
8823042 zelfs na twee jaar zeer intensief onderzoek zijn er nog dingen die we niet weten over de aanpak van mondriaan en hoe precies het schilderij in zijn uiteindelijke vorm tot stand is gekomen
8823043 het onderzoek valt in drie delen uiteen grofweg overeenkomend met de opbouw van het werk eerst is het steeds andere spel van horizontale en verticale lijnen dan de invulling van de vlakken daartussen in verschillende formaten en kleuren ten slotte de laatste fase waarin met stukjes plakband de lijnen worden onderbroken tot kleine vlakjes
8823044 de schaal is natuurlijk anders maar een schilderij bestaat vaak ook uit verschillende lagen hiermee hebben we bij voorbeeld ontdekt dat de vlakjes in vbw zijn opgebouwd uit twee of meer lagen tot een maximum van zeven daarnaast zitten er honderden stukjes gekleurde tape op
8823045 mondriaan werkte niet volgens vast recept daarom is het schilderij technisch gezien zo ingewikkeld hij veranderde lijnen vlakken en kleuren voortdurend pas in de laatste negen dagen voor zijn dood weten we uit archiefonderzoek heeft hij de stukjes tape toegevoegd zou hij die later hebben willen vervangen door verf we weten het niet
8823046 dit onderzoek wijst uit dat vbw in relatief goede staat verkeert
8823047 at its heart my work is both political and highly personal often taking me on strange dreamlike journeys where the past and the present merge and then separate
8823048 ik dacht aan een spierblessure een zweepslag het deed zon enorme pijn dat ik begon te schreeuwen
8823049 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im willing to have
8823050 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8823051 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington
8823052 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8823053 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8823054 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8823055 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8823056 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8823057 i assure you the republicans are not going to do that
8823058 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8823059 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8823060 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8823061 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8823062 john mccain served his country in war we honor his service but that doesnt mean we have to make him president
8823063 that rob he looks like the kind of guy that likes westerns
8823064 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away
8823065 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8823066 toutes les communaut s catholiques manifester pacifiquement pour sopposer de nouvelles attaques lencontre des chr tiens dans plusieurs parties du pays
8823067 so youll have a revolution by betraying those whove done nothing
8823068 what happened to your friend happens here it takes place at night on the stairs thats why no one goes out
8823069 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8823070 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8823071 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8823072 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8823073 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8823074 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8823075 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8823076 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8823077 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8823078 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8823079 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8823080 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8823081 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8823082 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
8823083 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
8823084 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8823085 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
8823086 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
8823087 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country toward health equity
8823088 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
8823089 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
8823090 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background
8823091 health delivery is not possible for people living in squalor in dehumanizing pathetic conditions prevailing in the ever growing slum settlements of cities and towns in developing countries investment in basic services such as water and education will always remain constrained if not wasted unless accompanied by requisite investment in decent housing with basic sanitation
8823092 countries of the world are presently growing apart in health terms this is very worrying in many countries in the world social differences in health are also growing and this is true in europe we have been one sidedly focused on economic growth disregarding negative consequences for health and climate we need to think differently about development
8823093 what this report makes clear is that improving health and health outcomes and reducing avoidable health differences goals of all countries involves far more than just improving the health care system basic living conditions employment early childhood education treatment of women and poverty all impact on health outcomes and incorporating their effects on health outcomes needs to become an important part of public policymaking this is as true for wealthy countries like the united states as it is for many of the emerging countries of the world where large numbers of people live on less than 2 per day
8823094 ich glaube barack obama hat die energie und das temperament dieses land zu f hren
8823095 just to see a guy out there like that is hard but the hangover from that isnt why we lost
8823096 other than losing a great player i dont think there was an emotional hangover that cost us to lose
8823097 we ran the ball really well it seemed like we didnt have many penalties either
8823098 turnovers we turned the ball over we kept getting three and outs wed get something going and give the ball right back to them
8823099 the defense played a good game weve just got to go to the drawing board and look at ourselves
8823100 we want to take this and learn from it t j is a young guy and hes going to learn from it
8823101 as a senior ive got to make them go out there and do that
8823102 they were fast they flew to the ball a little bit
8823103 i cant say we ever got into sync after that that was a long delay i dont know if the team came back from that
8823104 both times i guess i was worried too much about the block it happened its something i have to work on this week

8823107 this is what americas all about we can do anything when we put out minds to it
8823108 this is a man of destiny but horrible post speech music about 2 hours ago
8823109 id vote for him purely for the state of the union address be like the yearly super bowl of speeches
8823110 final night of convention is tonight dont miss baracks speech to get involved locally
8823111 he has a hard time with real feelings and emotions
8823112 obama repr sente le r ve am ricain du xxie si cle

8823114 the retail employment pathways program fills the void in the employment marketplace by matching trainees to host employers trying to attract good people into their businesses
8823115 by combining classroom and on the job training the free eight week retail certificate course produces job ready candidates for retail businesses signing up to the program as host employers host employers work together with ara trainers to develop participants providing them with vital industry skills
8823116 reducing headcount can be a knee jerk reaction to difficult trading pressures but organisations need to remember making redundancies can prove costly both in terms of payments in lieu of notice and recruiting new staff in an upturn
8823117 companies in all sectors could benefit from thinking creatively about how they reward and deploy their employees as alternatives to redundancies
8823118 in a difficult job market some people would rather keep their job under a different arrangement such as with reduced hours rather than be unemployed
8823119 strategies like this also mean that when the market picks up it is easier cheaper and quicker for companies to react
8823120 employers and employees alike can benefit from cost effective remuneration planning
8823121 in practice this might mean introducing flexible remuneration and benefit plans or offering salary sacrifice options simple changes at no or low costs can result in significant financial savings for employers and enhanced benefits to employees
8823122 the company has now fulfilled all aspects of the strategic growth plan outlined in rfgs may 2006 prospectus delivering upon its commitment to shareholders and transforming itself into a genuine market leader within the retail food franchising industry
8823123 not only has the company added two successful and highly recognized franchise systems to its portfolio in brumbys bakeries and michels patisserie it has continued to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in new outlet openings outlet average weekly sales and outlet average transaction values
8823124 whilst no business is immune from present market conditions rfgs systems have historically traded well during retail and economic adversity our franchise systems are well positioned in terms of product and service delivery to absorb the many current external market pressures

8823134 hey that new version was so much better than that lousy japanese version
8823135 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8823136 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8823137 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8823138 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8823139 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8823140 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8823141 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8823142 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8823143 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8823144 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8823145 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8823146 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8823147 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8823148 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8823149 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8823150 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse

8823152 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8823153 getting shots may seem burdensome and even downright scary to some children but they protect children against dangerous and deadly diseases

8823176 take this life preserver and swim or im dying with you
8823177 what else could they tell us in a third part
8823178 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8823179 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8823180 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8823181 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8823182 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8823183 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8823184 racing i booed at the tv set at indy 05 i booed the the hamilton crane fiasco not hamilton directly

8823187 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8823193 the intentional touching both directly and through the clothing of the groin breast inner thigh and buttocks of the complaining witness
8823194 he was such an upbeat guy that his friends brought their problems to him
8823195 mr campbell was a member of the church for more than 40 years
8823196 he served the church very well as an elder and attended worship almost every week he was a real example of christian strength
8823197 despite his handicap mr campbell was a very lively guy
8823198 he would get to bible study at 6 a m and make most of the family events at the church
8823199 everybody knew him for his corny jokes and his lively ways
8823200 but he was a very gentle soul meek in the biblical sense of the word
8823201 my dad was first in his class at culinary school at fort meade
8823202 we would get off the bus and dad would tell me which way to go he was so good he gave other people directions
8823203 he was a born leader everything he joined he always became head of it
8823204 he was one of the best organized people ive ever seen and one of the hardest workers i dont think there is a single lawyer in fayette county who would not recognize him as one of the most distinguished lawyers who ever worked here
8823205 he was a fierce lawyer to face he never backed off
8823206 he had a strong work ethic and integrity and when he spotted another gentleman with those qualities that drew him to him
8823207 exemplifies the spirit of volunteering themselves to better the community
8823208 if you look at sub saharan african markets theyve given annual returns that are substantially better than most around the world
8823209 even this year most of the economies around the world are not seeing very much growth 2 percent would look optimistic whereas in africa its been around 6 percent for years one of the fastest growing economies in the world is actually angola yet the perception is that its still in a state of war
8823210 a lot of the problems the u s economy is having you simply do not have that in africa
8823211 people are starting to see africa much more as the land of opportunity than in the traditional paradigm of starvation and famine and war
8823212 there are opportunities in a number of countries its not universal but its there
8823213 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree

8823236 i think i did okay amp squo amp squo he said after completing the race in about 17 minutes with the assistance of crutches a respectable time just over double the winner amp squo s mark
8823237 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8823238 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party dr nelson said in sydney today
8823239 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8823240 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8823241 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead
8823242 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit mr smirk said
8823243 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8823244 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8823245 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8823246 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8823247 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points mr oughton said
8823248 scope amp squo amp squo to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead
8823249 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state guzman told reporters
8823250 well there you have it we had to stop pat buchanan gushing over obamas speech for the sake of time perhaps that will tell you the story better than anything else we can say
8823251 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8823252 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8823253 all our bills are current and up to date all our rents are paid you have money flying through the door
8823254 i think people have got a complete misunderstanding of this so consequently im very confident
8823255 prior period adjustments arising out of a reassessment of accounting treatments
8823256 we have said publicly we will re look at every type of related party transaction
8823257 having said that its always been disclosed in the annual report theres nothing that weve ever hidden i think people just like to keep speculating on it to make it look like theres something sinister going on and theres not
8823258 absolutely not we have to be very conscious of separating the financial aspect of the business to what we actually do within the centers
8823259 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
8823260 thursday night as he embarked on the final lap of his audacious bid to become the nations first black president
8823261 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8823262 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8823263 what im doing now might be a sin but god understands because i cant sleep
8823264 je ne pourrais pas faire ce que font brad et angie je naurais pas la patience quil faut pour soccuper dune famille jadmire ces qualit s chez les autres mais ce nest pas pour moi

8823267 questa non una questione scientifica e una questione di nostra soglia di dolore quanto tempo passer prima che siamo tutti davvero daccordo a fare qualcosa
8823268 as mobile becomes ever more important and ever more central to peoples lives coverage is important
8823269 we dont want to just have a debate about whether the price should be five euro cents or 4 euro cents
8823270 we have got to ask about the future that may be uncomfortable for some people but i am not going to apologise for that
8823271 while the vast majority of us are happy with our mobiles and enjoy the experience there is a small but significant number who are dissatisfied
8823272 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8823273 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8823274 that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works

8823277 this break was good to defuse some of the negative publicity surrounding the incident we had
8823278 thats why coach laimbeer brought me here to do what does best and thats definitely to help them win more games
8823279 theyre going to have experience inside the post just with her so they did it for a reason taj is very experienced shes been in a position where shes been very successful what shes done so far in this league and in her career
8823280 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
8823281 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
8823282 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
8823283 were sending a message to people that its time to get down to business
8823284 i dont know what time it is we love playing basketball and i think our bodies kind of know what to do our defense was very solid and we pretty much picked up where we left off
8823285 honestly its weird because i came back and it was just like we played the other day
8823286 weve had many players not practicing if one player is just a little bit out of rhythm it really throws our systems off
8823287 really i was surprised in high school how quickly people made decisions about you
8823288 i never thought first impressions would count as much as they did in high school but they count for a lot overcoming that is really something you have to work toward
8823289 in the long run of life you probably wont remember most people you knew in high school in 10 years time
8823290 get to know everyone networking is important in high school too
8823291 the value of high school is that it lets you find out who you are now im just me
8823292 dont give up your friends on someone who probably wont be worth it
8823293 i just feel like for this moment that we can we would be crazy not to its such an amazing medium its such an interesting process
8823294 im hoping we create a show thats entertaining and as much fun as we think it is and hope it is
8823295 i dont think any one show can save the fall but i think a great show is something that we all want so i look forward to seeing the reaction
8823296 the biggest challenge was trying to make it relevant to now to do it despite it being star trek he said
8823297 its a question of how do you make it something that would be what it wants it to be even if it hasnt been a series before you invest completely in the characters and you tell a story that is good regardless of the setting
8823298 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8823299 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8823300 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8823301 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8823302 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8823303 cn your cname example com ou sun java system application server o sun microsystems l santa clara st california c us
8823304 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8823305 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8823306 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8823307 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8823308 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8823309 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8823310 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8823311 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8823312 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8823313 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8823314 its like nails on a chalkboard when i hear that
8823315 i love to visit minneapolis but theres something about st paul thats charming and simple
8823316 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
8823317 making money is easy if you are willing to steal it
8823318 we really wanted to keep it the core family keep it the nuclear family
8823319 i think theres a lot of takeaway for everybody whos watching the show to take back and use it in their own familys lives
8823320 its not just that theyre related but we really play the family dynamic throughout the series
8823321 i think the one thing we practiced and preached before this season was play the game hard but dont play the game with the scale
8823322 do the best you can every week on the scale and let the game come secondary the contestants this season really took that to heart
8823323 thank you for trying out our mash beta service we hope you had fun with it please note that we will shut down mash on september 29 2008 as a result your current profile on mash will no longer be available
8823324 anchorage has no more effect on climate change or polar ice than does an emission in ankara
8823325 make the polar bears protections more meaningless than they already are
8823326 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8823327 youre going to have all the resources this campaign has available thats the good news
8823328 the bad news youre going to have a whole helluva lot of me because im coming home
8823329 joe bidens effort to create a record out of thin air for barack obama will not be enough to make up for barack obamas lack of experience lack of judgment and plans to raise taxes on the hard working families of pennsylvania
8823330 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8823331 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8823332 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8823333 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
8823334 and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had for themselves
8823335 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life
8823336 that your word is your bond that you do what you say youre going to do
8823337 that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8823338 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8823339 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8823340 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8823341 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8823342 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8823343 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8823344 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8823345 a president cant vote present a president cant pick and choose which challenges he or she will face
8823346 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8823347 in a way to avoid having to know the hard things
8823348 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8823349 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8823350 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8823351 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8823352 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
8823353 bills received for the second meeting of the 2008 2009 session
8823354 a series of scientific arguments which appear to support the theory have been assembled if examined closely these are found to be based on unsound scientific and mathematical foundations
8823355 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
8823356 when there is more carbon dioxide the temperature gets warmer
8823357 each of the six seminars will raise a different commonly asked question about climate change and its our job as scientists to provide the answers
8823358 this first session will look at the most basic of questions which seems to be a major sticking point for some how can the earth really be warming
8823359 remarks such as this get in the way of climate action as they call into question whether theres a problem to address
8823360 the fact that some people are asking these questions means that we as scientists have a responsibility to explain the science behind climate change
8823361 members of the public will also get to ask questions at the end of each seminar
8823362 attempt by the anti car fanatics to screw up our traffic on behalf of the bicycle fantasy
8823363 the behavior of the bike people on city streets is always annoying
8823364 this get out of my way im not burning fossil fuels
8823365 regardless of the obvious dangers some people will ride bikes in san francisco for the same reason islamic fanatics will engage in suicide bombings because they are politically motivated to do so
8823366 in case anyone doubted that you were a wingnut this statement pretty much sums things up
8823367 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
8823368 although ocean acidification is affecting the health of our oceans the same thing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is going to in fact be affecting terrestrial environments also
8823369 the united states economy has a total weather sensitivity of roughly 2 5 trillion 23 percent of the national economy
8823370 in contrast bolivia has a total weather sensitivity of just over 2 billion thats 31 percent of the bolivian economy
8823371 these farmers have corn on the ground and are not covered for a frost event for the rest of the season and some might have corn through late october
8823372 were seeing a lot of corn farmers buying coverage from us for frost from illinois iowa and minnesota
8823373 made millions of dollars hedging hundreds of millions of dollars in risk
8823374 means that a dollar in brazil will be thirty times more weather sensitive than a dollar in pakistan
8823375 were primarily a technology company and weve built a platform that allows us to write any sort of weather contract for any sort of business to protect against their specific risks
8823376 were really trying to bring these products to the masses
8823377 this gives us a larger retail location and a consolidation of the stores
8823378 i was 20 years at anderson square and five years ago moved to cardinal avenue tropical lattitude has been there 11 years
8823379 the time is right for a facelift maybe some streetscapes i would think its time to give downtown a new look absolutely it would be great to pedestrianise some of the area
8823380 i just guess well have to find somewhere else to go
8823381 i dont have a closing date yet but there are a couple of reasons
8823382 its not our core business and the market was not a hugely successful thing the owners have the opportunity to sell the building or to get another tenant so we took the opportunity for change
8823383 it is possible we might reopen down the road from there if something pops up later we may go back in but for now no we are just going to focus on our competition and our core business
8823384 this rejuvenation has been going on already for a good five years or six years
8823385 with the old westwind building now owned by dart realty and the landmark building and the conversion of the old royal plaza
8823386 the place next door to the fort street market which today is senor frogs used to be the old hunter law offices so things very definitely have evolved
8823387 jockeying for position with the changes to the cruise facilities no one really knows what will happen until they understand what is really happening with the port but it means huge changes
8823388 the market has been off this year but with this redevelopment and with cruise ships staying overnight and at the docks well these people are smart and with the rejuvenation they just need to streamline traffic flows
8823389 should airlines have a section of the plane reserved for parents with babies and smaller children
8823390 the storm is 40 miles wide and about 100 miles long
8823391 we dropped 30 degrees between 8 and 10 p m
8823392 we will continue to watch the storms build again friday afternoon on the rim and then into the valley
8823393 because she always encourages me to do the right thing
8823394 my father donnie dixon is from the brac so the transition was easy for the family
8823395 i am currently an immigration consultant law student and enjoy the every day challenges of both
8823396 soccer american football and basketball are my favs i love to play soccer but injuries have slowed me down a bit this year and im slowly coming back i am also an avid weight lifter so i believe that being active is essential to a healthy life not only do sports keep you fit and strong but it can help mentally as well
8823397 i find that stress tension and even depression levels can be reduced when playing a game you love even if its only for 90 minutes
8823398 i also follow the nfl with my team being the packers
8823399 scotiabank is pleased to support the lions club of tropical gardens efforts in continuing to increase breast cancer awareness in our community
8823400 thanks to the efforts of this organisation hundreds of women will benefit from free mammograms in the coming year and they will also assist a number of cancer survivors with their medical expenses overseas scotiabank therefore wishes much success to the club with this campaign
8823401 this financial contribution will not only provide free mammograms but also assist cancer patients and their family with medical and other related expenses
8823402 ronald forbes we are soaring over the hurdles with you all the way to 2012
8823403 the chinese people were very warm and welcoming to me they were always helpful and polite in fact they would even push the buttons on the elevator for you before you even had a chance to do it yourself
8823404 once we know what the weather will be like well be able to set a date
8823405 but you can be sure that it will be a great party as were all extremely proud of ronald everyone in cayman but most especially the people of north side
8823406 this was a routine update of a biography by the obits department meant for the internal system and not meant for publication
8823407 it was momentarily posted on the external wire in error and immediately deleted
8823408 the present litigation is more complex than the misinformed and mischaracterized allegations of copyright infringement
8823409 the litigation involves the anti competitive nature of the apple eula and similar anti competitive tactics related to the misuse of apples copyrights
8823410 allowing more people to take advantage of a great operating system that apple has created at a more accessible cost than the pricey mac
8823411 gave his entire 25k in savings to charity abandoned his car and most of his possessions burned all the cash in his wallet
8823412 america touts itself as the land of the free but the number one freedom that you and i have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace once you exercise this freedom youve lost all control over what you do what is produced and how it is produced and in the end the product doesnt belong to you the only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you dont care about making a living which leads to the second freedom the freedom to starve
8823413 so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservatism all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the very basic core of a mans living spirit is his passion for adventure the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun
8823414 you are wrong if you think joy emanates only or principally from human relationships god has placed it all around us it is in everything and anything we might experience we just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living
8823415 whose mythos has endowed our culture with the tendency underlying all the evil of our technology the tendency to do what is reasonable even when it isnt any good
8823416 the tendency to do what is reasonable even when it isnt very good
8823417 we just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle
8823418 ive written three ny times best sellers making me the only person to have written more books than hes read
8823419 behind every successful person stands a very surprised mother in law
8823420 have i pleased god enough that i may enter heaven
8823421 then he whose balance of good deeds will be found heavy will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction but he whose balance of good deeds will be found light will have his home in a bottomless pit
8823422 for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law will be justified
8823423 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
8823424 being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in christ jesus whom god displayed publicly as a propitiation in his blood through faith
8823425 abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness
8823426 now to him who works the wages are not counted as grace but as debt
8823427 just as david also speaks of the blessing upon the man to whom god reckons righteousness apart from works blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered blessed is the man whose sin the lord will not take into account
8823428 si estaba hablando con un se ora de 80 a os o con una ni a de 4 la mujer m s bella del mundo pod a pasar frente a l y no la mirar a

8823431 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step only he who keeps his eyes fixed on the far horizon will find the right road
8823432 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8823433 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8823434 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8823435 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8823436 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8823437 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8823438 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8823439 als opperbevelhebber zal ik nooit aarzelen deze natie te verdedigen aldus de democratische presidenstkandidaat voor een uitzinnige menigte in
8823440 maar ik zal onze troepen alleen aan gevaar blootstellen met een duidelijke missie en een heilige verplichting hen de uitrusting te geven die zij in de strijd nodig hebben en de zorg en beloning die zij verdienen als zij thuiskomen
8823441 was trots geweest op barack obama trots op de partij die hem heeft genomineerd trots op het amerika dat hem zal kiezen
8823442 blessed are you simon bar jona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
8823443 but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may know surely what is the will of god what is good and well pleasing and perfect
8823444 letter send a clear message to the uk and the us
8823445 basically they are waiting to return home or for any processing of any applications they have so it is not meant to be a secure 100 percent impregnable facility
8823446 on this occasion the migrants stormed the doors and as the centre is not a prison there is not a great deal we can do about it
8823447 although we have beefed up the security at the centre if they really are intent on getting out then they will find a way
8823448 residents are reminded that regular household garbage should be stored separately from hurricane debris
8823449 any hurricane debris generated by gustavs passage should be separated into vegetative tree debris construction debris and metal for collection
8823450 due to the current predicted track of hurricane gustav customers are reminded that major hurricanes pose a serious threat to our pipelines along the coast
8823451 therefore it may become necessary for the authority to temporarily disrupt service in order to protect the distribution system should this action become necessary the water authority will give as much notice as possible once the decision has been made
8823452 education professionals in the government system in grand cayman should not report to the westin hotel on thursday august 28 2008
8823453 not to report to the brac reef resort on monday september 1 2008
8823454 all members of the education service will be advised of reporting instructions at a later date
8823455 tickets already purchased will be honoured tickets are still on sale at reflections and funky tangs
8823456 the royal cayman islands police service rcips would like to advise the public that the police department is fully prepared for gustav
8823457 the rcips is constantly preparing to deal with these situations officers are fully briefed on their roles and responsibilities and are equipped to deal with any emergency that a storm could bring
8823458 the pre planned hurricane strategy has been put into operation command centres and structures are being established police staff have prepared themselves and are ready to respond the strategy focuses on law and order
8823459 i saw this as an opportunity to observe how police deal with underprivileged people
8823460 once i realized she was attempting to get me to give her my camera i became confused and told her i would not give it to her
8823461 i had not committed any crime and had been sitting peacefully just like many others around me
8823462 i found this to be absurd since there were no benches around and there were many other people sitting around the square
8823463 the ledge and the area around the ledge where i was sitting is styled in such a way that it appears to have been intended to be used as a seating area in addition to any other apparent purpose it may have

8823477 one of the great problems with our country is that we talk about rights such as privacy and freedom of speech and the like but they are not enshrined or protected in any way as they are in america
8823478 while there are always limits on freedom of speech you cant incite violence or anything like that it seems to be now more than ever that our rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression should be protected
8823479 a bill of rights which enshrines that protection is long overdue in this country

8823503 in the interests of the safety of all students as well as in recognition of the schools physical environment

8823511 once i realized she was attempting to get me to give her my camera i became confused and told her i would not give it to her
8823512 i had not committed any crime and had been sitting peacefully just like many others around me

8823561 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten as always check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants
8823562 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here
8823563 the safest course of action is to say we wont certify imports from china because their law wont allow inspections
8823564 everybody there is so proud of increased production that few people ask much about the farmers production methods
8823565 everything was just food and it was until the 1950s mostly organic by our contemporary definitions fertilized with human and animal waste compost and ashes
8823566 so that respected members of the organic community can monitor and police violations of organic standards on the part of producers importers and certifiers
8823567 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
8823568 rats have almost no bones and are quite rich in nutrition people at large dont know this cuisine fact but gradually they are catching up
8823569 yes that proposal is in its advance stage and well very soon engage them in various social activities of our department
8823570 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
8823571 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalized regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
8823572 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa

8823578 there is oedema on both the feet scaly skin on her legs even her respiration rate is high
8823579 the child is in a lethargic condition her hair is thin sparse lustreless easily pluckable these are the typical symptoms of protein energy malnutrition
8823580 its basically inadequate access to food poor feeding practices poor childcare practices
8823581 in the past year food prices have increased significantly but peoples incomes havent improved
8823582 like wheat earlier they used to buy it at eight rupees a kilogram now its 12 rupees
8823583 because of the increase in food prices a mother cannot buy an adequate quantity of milk fruits and vegetables so their staple diet has become wheat chapattis
8823584 a child cannot survive on wheat chapattis alone about 80 of mothers and children are anaemic because they cant get good quality food

8823593 consumers really are willing to sacrifice convenience to manage their budgets
8823594 leveling off occurred much more quickly than people anticipated as a result of the economy
8823595 i would have expected a slowdown this year because of the price pressure that people are seeing
8823596 i still believe the restaurant trend is more dominant right now

8823600 to shoot the messenger weve got to attack their credibility as spokespersons
8823601 draw attention to our enemies just about every consumer and environmental group chef legislator or doctor who raises objections to things like pesticide use genetic engineering of crops or antibiotic use in beef and poultry
8823602 who helped peddle the tobacco industrys message at the tobacco institute before the lobby group was dismantled last year as part of an agreement with the states
8823603 id lke to propose to philip morris the establishment of the guest choice network
8823604 the concept is to unite the restaurant and hospitality industries in a campaign to defend their consumers and marketing programs against attacks from anti smoking anti drinking anti meat etc activists i would like to solicit philip morris for an initial contribution of 600 000
8823605 restaurants hotels casinos bowling alleys taverns stadiums and university hospitality educators
8823606 support mentality of smokers rights by encouraging responsibility to protect guest choice
8823607 as of this writing pm usa is still the only contributor though berman continues to promise others any day now

8823615 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family

8823618 john mccain seems to see that the problems with public education lie within the schools and that the solutions are to be found outside the schools obama seems to be suggesting more solutions that work inside the schools that would reach kids who are struggling
8823619 are those who dont come from healthy homes in the first place mccains idea that giving parents more control and more school choices doesnt actually solve the underlying problem of uninvolved parents

8823621 my last several weeks have been a whirlwind of activity responding to evangelicals reaching out to me
8823622 pro life voters of either party can now support senator obama on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe v wade
8823623 we put a womans right to choose in a lockbox and strengthened the language significantly
8823624 either side could put their own moral gloss on the language
8823625 ive been a pastor for 35 years and im in favor of choice
8823626 what kind of choice is it when a woman has to choose between terminating a pregnancy or being poor
8823627 what kind of choice is it if you dont have prenatal care
8823628 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
8823629 you could reduce the number of abortions right now by closing down the clinics and forcing women to have children they dont want
8823630 weve got to find a way to reduce abortions while the legal debate goes on and on
8823631 if im an unborn child and i want the support of the far right i better stay unborn as long as possible because once im born im off the screen
8823632 our position is that abortion is never a good option no matter what the circumstances
8823633 it hasnt changed my driving at all not a bit i just have to work harder
8823634 we do see reports of a significant change in the types of cars people are buying but ive been mostly surprised at the lack of a reaction
8823635 one had hoped that these prices would deter driving but people have coped better than we hoped they would
8823636 we believe that co2 from personal transport has to be decreased in a holistic way with contributions from all sectors no one thing will bring levels down
8823637 everyone puts all the pressure on the manufacturers and were doing our part
8823638 but others should do their part as well nothing much has been done with driving improving infrastructure
8823639 price appears to be a highly effective way of influencing behavior
8823640 price alone doesnt win popular support or acquiescence there has to be a package of a variety of different policies including improvements to public transport walking and cycling
8823641 the plea of guilty must attract a significant discounted penalty
8823642 she comes before the court as a significant figure in this state with a significant list of achievements

8823652 the indian economy is clearly slowing but rising interest rates high inflation not yet seen as peaking and a depreciating currency makes it impossible to cut interest rates to stimulate demand
8823653 furthermore domestic political woes and possible future tensions with pakistan following the political vacuum there have also dented risk appetite among overseas investors
8823654 the issue is whether that consultation process was reasonable and whether any resulting accommodation was adequate
8823655 the crowns obligation to reasonably consult is not fulfilled simply by providing a process within which to exchange and discuss information
8823656 nevertheless there is no question that substantial logging and road building have occurred on those lands and that these activities have had a significant impact on the sustainability of timber resources and on other aspects of gitanyow tradition and culture

8823683 we found no difference in the proportion of stems twining clockwise versus anticlockwise between the hemispheres
8823684 ninety two per cent of the stems we recorded twined in an anticlockwise direction
8823685 we are now investigating the possibility that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of the left handed bias of all biological molecules on earth
8823686 all natural proteins on earth are left handed molecules with a tendency to twist in one direction
8823687 in plants the cell skeletons are made of proteins if the proteins have a tendency to twist to the left so might the plant stems
8823688 and let it be noted that there is no more delicate matter to take in hand nor more dangerous to conduct nor more doubtful in its success than to

8823705 on a team like the olympic team you dont have to be so aggressive it will just come in terms of scoring it was just whoever got it got it
8823706 i obviously didnt get it as much as the others but thats cool i was more than happy to play my role
8823707 that hasnt stopped me before so im not exactly sure we cant continue to play like this and expect to have a chance to be in the playoffs
8823708 i thought it was the best weve played defensively and weve done a good job all year
8823709 we did some things out there that we didnt even talk about doing it was just great instinctual play by our players
8823710 vedo con favore il ritorno del voto in condotta perch coinvolge e responsabilizza i ragazzi anche perch accompagnato dalleducazione alla cittadinanza
8823711 e particolarmente apprezzabile spiega il ministro lo sforzo riformatore del ministro gelmini poich va nel senso di restituire alla scuola un ruolo educativo che negli decenni ha progressivamente perso cos il ritorno del voto di condotta non si configura come semplice strumento sanzionatorio a totale discrezione dei docenti ma viene accompagnato dalleducazione alla cittadinanza e da una complessiva responsabilizzazione degli studenti sar infatti il consiglio di classe con la partecipazione dei rappresentanti studenteschi a esprimere le valutazioni penso sia il metodo migliore per dimostrare che fenomeni come il bullismo sono marginali rispetto alla stragrande maggioranza dei nostri giovani e che i ragazzi sanno trovare lantidoto contro gli esempi negativi
8823712 im called brian on the pitch and by close friends as i have shown character and depth like the brilliant west indies cricketer brian lara
8823713 i am very happy to get through that heat because it was not an easy one
8823714 the waves were perfect clean long and offering great potential so i went for the maximum comitment and it paid off
8823715 i am learning on every aspect of my surfing and it is hard sometimes
8823716 i feel like i have improved competing against the worlds best surfers and am really feeling good and fit i cannot wait to get next round going
8823717 besides getting the babies acquainted with the water this provides an avenue for parents to also teach their children to swim
8823718 and here they will feel more comfortable with their children in the water
8823719 parents were hesitant initially but were surprised to see their babies holding their breath so long under the water parents were also taught the different techniques to identify when their children are not breathing properly or have developed complications when submerged
8823720 i do believe the objectives were met and parents have learnt a lot about babies and water and how to react to certain situation as it relates to their kids playing in a pool
8823721 our babies in the cayman islands cannot visit the pool unless they have reached age three based on the government policies hence our objective is to introduce babies from an earlier age as all three islands are surrounded by water and hopefully this policy will be revamped
8823722 we wanted to get the parents and babies in the water and understand ways that they can teach their child to be safe in and around the water
8823723 we set out to be able by the end of the week to have the kids able to be immersed in the water and hold their breath for that second and to be comfortable with that immersion
8823724 i do feel that the main objectives of this water babies class were met and with a nice turn out of 11 babies we have begun talks into sasi offering this class on a weekly basis during the year
8823725 menos constante pero con tramos realmente inhumanos tiene cinco kil metros enormemente duros
8823726 es como mirar por la ventana de un avi n
8823727 quiero empezar diciendo que agotar la legislatura y que no habr adelanto electoral
8823728 no hay emergencias debilidades ni circunstancias de inestabilidad que aconsejen su revisi n
8823729 una situaci n econ mica m s dif cil de la que ten amos hasta ahora
8823730 y el gobierno que demostr fortaleza y estabilidad durante la ltima etapa no va a salir corriendo ante las dificultades
8823731 el funcionamiento de las instituciones y el debate pol tico no se vean condicionados por la proximidad de un falso debate electoral
8823732 con el nico prop sito de servir a galicia anteponiendo los intereses del pa s a cualquier consideraci n de tipo partidario
8823733 s lo galicia es el norte de mi acci n de gobierno
8823734 no tengo m s hipotecas que el compromiso adquirido con mi tierra
8823735 siempre en funci n de nuestros intereses como pa s nunca como un instrumento de ventaja pol tica
8823736 en su momento tendr en cuenta que no es buena una coincidencia electoral con lo que est convocado que sabemos que existe y tiene fecha precisa que son las elecciones europeas
8823737 estamos lejos quedan muchos meses para el agotamiento de la legislatura
8823738 que a partir de ah no me vea en la obligaci n de tener que poner una fecha
8823739 la funci n del presidente no es estar movi ndose como una hoja al viento llevada por una serpiente de verano
8823740 dif cilmente me ver n saliendo al paso de cada bulo
8823741 afrontar los retos del pa s en un momento de especial dificultad econ mica
8823742 hago una apelaci n a la lealtad y la responsabilidad
8823743 que el gobierno siga gobernando y la oposici n haga su trabajo
8823744 ser curioso ver la marcha atr s de aquellos que dijeron lo que dijeron sobre la libertad del presidente su liderazgo y su capacidad de decisi n
8823745 espero ver c mo rectifican aquellos que afirmaban que el gobierno estaba roto y a pesar de eso no quer an un adelanto electoral
8823746 go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
8823747 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it
8823748 but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8823749 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8823750 this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8823751 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was
8823752 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8823753 si vous avez encore un peu de temps sinon tant pis je le ferai
8823754 there were no discussions with editorial staff we were just delivered this email with no follow up that told us about all these job cuts
8823755 we work damn hard we put in long long hours and to be told that we are overpaid and that were not efficient its a kick in the guts
8823756 no one likes strike action we like producing newspapers but there is no other way of getting our message across

8823763 developing a snowboard video game has always been a dream of mine there are endless synergies between a snowboard film production and a game developer that were just waiting to be activated bongfish and destineer have realized this potential and have shown a real passion for snowboarding and together weve worked to bring snowboarding luminaries from across the planet together for this project
8823764 even when theres no storm the ramp will be a great convenience for the people of the brac
8823765 its essential and should have been done a long time
8823766 it opens a gateway to development and brings a boost to the economy

8823770 you may easily identify numbers such as date of birth phone numbers and addresses but there is a significant difference when people are aware and talk about numbers that can effect your good health and a better way of life
8823771 this cannot be felt by the patient so you should check this on a yearly basis or more
8823772 regular checks should be done every 3 to 5 years when a person reaches the age of 40 years
8823773 to maintain this it is advisable to write down what you eat each day in an attempt to prevent you from exceeding your required daily calorie intake
8823774 you dont have to go to the gym to exercise simple walking for a few minutes per day and using detergent bottles in the home can substitute for dumb bells at the gym

8823784 everyone is entitled to their opinion but i have met the requirements so if someone strongly believes that these requirements should change then they need to address it with the ministry responsible for the pageant
8823785 i think i am still getting used to it but of course i am excited that all of my hard work paid off
8823786 there were seven other amazing young ladies who i believe would have been capable of doing the job but there is only one crown so i am looking forward to my year as miss cayman because i believe i have a lot to offer and am ready for the challenge
8823787 i was just myself i am the type of person who takes pride in all that i do so i put my best foot forward and knew that if i didnt win then the crown was just not meant for me
8823788 i am just one of those persons who assimilate a lot of information and know how to handle themselves in certain situations
8823789 we know that danielle has a beautiful mega watt smile and was deserving of the best smile prize and rachel has very toned legs so she should have gotten the best legs prize
8823790 it was all relief and tears of joy i know the other young ladies worked hard but i can only speak for myself and tell you that i worked extremely hard even though i knew i was capable of capturing the crown there was still a tiny part of me that wondered what if i lose
8823791 i dont want the caribbean to be another sub saharan africa hiv statistics show that we in the caribbean are second to sub saharan africa in hiv infection levels and while cayman may not contribute a lot to those numbers i think we still need to be careful
8823792 a lot of people are nonchalant about it but we have had five new cases this year alone and four of those cases have died people need to be vigilant because this is their health so i encourage everyone to go and get tested
8823793 my friends who know me know that things like this only challenge me more
8823794 lets put it this way i have a strong support system
8823795 i have known or heard of miss sybil all of my adult life and i always thought of her as a great lady
8823796 i visited the public gallery of the legislature to see her at work as the clerk i was always interested in politics and i visited the gallery often
8823797 she was always a brave woman who spoke her mind according to how she felt she was so knowledgeable about the affairs of the state
8823798 miss sybil had a vast experience of being clerk i believe she knows more about procedure and conventions of government than anybody else in the cayman islands and possibly the region
8823799 then i became minister of community development and culture i felt we should have a living national hero
8823800 i believe this country appreciates the way we made miss sybil our living national hero
8823801 she loves us she loves these islands and we love her
8823802 i can extend to miss sybil a very happy birthday from all of us in the legislature
8823803 miss sybil on behalf of my colleagues thank you for guiding us the way you have
8823804 its good getting together with all these people i havent seen for ages
8823805 santa dont cry this life is my choice i fight for freedom i dont ask for more my life is my god my country my corps
8823806 rambunctious filled with superbly executed details this book not only gets its job done it completely transcends its agenda
8823807 a man more determined to right wrongs root out corruption and injustice and produce a noble nation
8823808 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
8823809 the fact that this happened with it being the second and third day of school is scary
8823810 sometimes just our response or our presence could prevent incidents in the future
8823811 its been described as the college food service oscars and we are very proud to do so well
8823812 i like having the option of choosing between all types of different meals they offer a wide variety of food that everyone can enjoy
8823813 the research and external funding really help us in recruiting new faculty
8823814 we can say look at what this person in your field has been able to do here and that is an incentive for professors to come here
8823815 external funding allows us to recruit diverse students from around the world
8823816 it provides unparalleled research opportunities to students at miami we place a very high priority on what we call hands on access to equipment that is available in the top graduate schools in the country
8823817 as low as 5 to 10 percent of the applicants can actually be funded by certain organizations
8823818 the funding rate varies by who you apply to you can get a good review but they might not have enough money to fund your proposal
8823819 hes one of the few entertainers comedians especially who provide clean comedy thats universal
8823820 with family weekend were always looking for entertainers that will be appealing to both parents and students
8823821 going along that same realm of a talk show host and comedian we thought jay leno would suit the bill
8823822 i dont think he would necessarily get too heated for one side or the other

8823824 he promised rick warren in so many words that hed give us a pro life administration
8823825 if he goes back on that why should we believe him on anything else and especially on the kind of supreme court justices he would pick
8823826 that demonizing your opponent isnt essential to talking about and even winning your point
8823827 every bone in my body wanted to go yeah but yeah but in a follow up mode and to spend the next 30 minutes on each issue
8823828 with all due respect to jim lehrer tom brokaw and bob schieffer the somewhat nondiverse group selected by the debate commission as the three presidential debate moderators one of them should step aside for warren
8823829 i had no idea that john would be that good
8823830 johns answer when i asked about whats your greatest moral sin he blew everybody away and he went right to the point when he said the failure of my first marriage paused teared up and went for the next question hes not of the oprah generation that spills out all the details there was a 72 year old man being honest in the way he was taught to be honest
8823831 now both of these guys i look at obama as the how to say it the thoughtful consensus builder hes a constitutional attorney so hes got all these nuances john is a straightforward happy warrior yes yes no and get em out of here i wanted to fall out of my seat when he gave that education answer
8823832 let me be very clear im not opposed to having a great conversation about the effect of the age limit but the amethyst resolution asserted that the problem was the 21 age limit
8823833 that the 21 year old drinking age is not working and specifically that it has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on signatories campuses
8823834 support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8823835 im not saying categorically that we shouldnt lower the drinking age i think its worthy of discussion
8823836 the resolution frankly im embarrassed that it would be written in the way it was it was deceptively presented
8823837 the detectives worked really hard to solve this because we didnt want someone walking the streets with the capacity to commit such a random act of violence
8823838 i knew when the phone rang at 2 a m that it wasnt going to be good news
8823839 he drove the whole way home without pain medication hes a tough kid
8823840 evan is a really conscientious student and this is just really sad
8823841 the big thing to remember is to watch out for yourself and be safe anywhere you go
8823842 the public at large should be entitled to know his true identity and not have his name changed so as to hide it
8823843 it does seem like a different name than the name he had while at miami would make it easier to hide his past
8823844 it would depend on his intentions and the extent that people at miami still remember his given name it would be confusing
8823845 i could not pretend to tell you that i know his psychological profile but it seems like almost anything is possible
8823846 do people do bizarre things yes things that are unimaginable
8823847 we filed a brief in opposition to his name change primarily because we think that hes not entitled to get an expungement of his record
8823848 changing your name is a way of indirectly detaching yourself from your past criminal conduct
8823849 the task force came up with recommendations for what we need to think about doing to make advising more transparent for students
8823850 advising is something asg has been working on for a long time
8823851 there have been lots of attempts to change the advising system and finally something big has actually been done
8823852 there are different puzzle pieces that make up a college experience
8823853 you have to be able to put them together and make sense of them you have to have some kind of adviser to help bring those ideas together
8823854 we will aim to help students who are exploring their interests with what major options they have to create an educational plan thats unique to them
8823855 i guess that is a good statement kind of overdue got to win it to deserve it
8823856 i always believe the match is on my racket i think every time i lose is because of me not because of the other person
8823857 i felt tight from the beginning of the match to the end
8823858 theres good case law that says you cant avoid a home run motion by leaving the ballpark
8823859 the case law says you cant dismiss a case to get around paying attorney fees
8823860 you can sue them in new york state if the lawsuit arises out of a contract he entered into in new york
8823861 i can sue him in new york thats the only reason i dismissed in california
8823862 balco the straight dope on barry bonds marion jones and what we can do to save sports
8823863 the most effective and successful reading initiative in the nations history
8823864 no one since art rupe and specialty records has ever found the formula for making hit records with the wildest rocker of them all
8823865 you shall not know the truth and doubt will set you free
8823866 sharlets book is one of the most compelling and brilliantly researched expos s youll ever read just dont read it alone at night
8823867 a generation of fundamentalist intellectuals studied a reenchanted american past
8823868 they are very difficult to do ive thought about it
8823869 they are very difficult to do ive thought about it
8823870 its a big honor that people recognize us and is something to look forward to to give us more motivation
8823871 but it shows how good our defense is as well as our linebacker coach craig aukerman who pushes us to be perfect
8823872 it says a lot about them as individuals and the defense as a whole but these guys have played ball for a long time
8823873 you have got to give vanderbilt a lot of credit tonight
8823874 even though they lost all five starters up front it chalks up to how athletic they were and how those guys have played ball theyre a very good football team thats very well coached
8823875 i wont be dining or drinking in style because it costs so much to fill my gas tank
8823876 i was in oxford all summer and only went home twice and traveled as little as possible because i couldnt afford to fill my tank that often
8823877 the gas prices here are much cheaper than where i live
8823878 so i do not think that it will really affect any of my plans in a way i feel like im getting a deal out here
8823879 lots of students that live nearby commute all four years because they can save a lot of money
8823880 commuting was more practical than living on campus i am lucky enough to live only 20 minutes away from campus so it saves a lot of money to commute rather than live on campus
8823881 it is very convenient to have an on campus job so that i dont have to drive more than i already do
8823882 airfare is so expensive now im debating driving home for christmas
8823883 if i drive with my friend whose car takes regular gas unlike mine it will be worth it
8823884 id like to see more people on buses and fewer cars in parking lots
8823885 as far as what will happen this year i dont know
8823886 its hard to tell right now we might see fewer students bringing back cars and registering for parking permits we might not see those cars until prices go down
8823887 my goal is to have the budget adopted before dec 1
8823888 it gives us a chance to look at the different sections of the budget
8823889 understand that each department asked for a little more than they got
8823890 my goal is to maintain the citys good financial standing
8823891 its expensive and difficult to redevelop the wal mart because of the two entities controlling the property
8823892 they are currently looking for someone to sublease the land from them and looking for someone to buy their building nobody wants an empty big box sitting around
8823893 the firm initially had a hearing for their 30 000 square feet plan but it was tabled and the city said come back again with a plan for 40 000 square feet
8823894 the city is sensitive to ample student housing but we also want to see that space redeveloped
8823895 its just another little quandary inside all the little boxes of issues
8823896 all of the water pipes and electrical wiring were replaced under this stretch of road
8823897 now when heavy trucks come down the street they wont put pressure on the bricks and push them down because the roads are newly reinforced as a result of this construction
8823898 the construction on high street commenced aug 1 and is projected to be completed by sept 4
8823899 it was scheduled to be in progress for 41 days but it is proceeding at a faster rate than predicted because the workers have been busy rushing to complete it by working 12 hour days for six days a week
8823900 a while back the city council realized that they had extra funds left over from other projects so in actuality this project is being carried out with this spare money and is virtually free to us
8823901 its a compliment that miami trusts me with the leadership of womens basketball
8823902 i take great pride in the program and feel very fortunate for the opportunity
8823903 the energy and focus that i put into teaching each year will always remain a constant
8823904 im very confident in my assistant coaches as well as the players and i feel that its an opportunity to coach each day coaching at miami is always enjoyable
8823905 it fosters improvement and leads to championships we graduated two talented players last year but we are excited about our upperclassmen that have returned im hopeful that the freshman will contribute early on we are very fortunate to recruit the caliber of student athletes that focus on their goals
8823906 weve been seeing more and more students come as they get settled back in
8823907 we established a few regulars who live in oxford but were always hoping to get more people coming in
8823908 all weve done so far with advertising is put out a flyer welcoming students back into town and we also created a web site
8823909 other than that its just been word of mouth and a few newspapers have come in to do reviews
8823910 a lot of the food we have you cant find anywhere else in town and the atmosphere is great
8823911 the inside was totally redone since lottie moons was there and it is a relaxing place to come and enjoy a meal
8823912 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8823913 i met rhonda flatz byers at a conference in the states and invited her to the cayman islands to share her wealth of knowledge to all different age group including the parents
8823914 our goal is to provide each swimmer with the necessary tools to become the best swimmer he or she can be today next week and in the years to come
8823915 we have amazing stories to tell about each child who participated in the camp and the objectives that were set have been met
8823916 the coaches on the brac are committed individuals and have always set their sights on elevating youth programmes on the sister islands it would be remiss of me not to mention the commitment of the sports department
8823917 the ministry has invested in the youths of this country and they continue to ensure that the sports department of cayman brac have all the necessities for the success of their programmes
8823918 in the babies programme they had smaller attention spans and are just beginning to following instructions from someone other than their parents
8823919 by the end we saw that they were able to listen and understand concepts and put those concepts into action in the water
8823920 i came to the brac and immediately seized the opportunity of touring the island and snorkeling at the beach at carib sands she said
8823921 the most we experience in oregon is snow and the cold with a few showers occasionally the threat of the tropical storm would be my first experience and the only thing i could think about is reaching the bluff although i had no idea where it was
8823922 sejak saya disingkir sepuluh tahun yang lalu dengan cara yang zalim seluruh jentera umno dan barisan nasional bn hingga kini berusaha dengan cara yang jahat untuk menghalang saya menduduki kerusi ini
8823923 kami pakatan rakyat akan menjadikan parlimen berfungsi dengan cara yang betul dan akan memastikan suara atau tuntutan rakyat akan didengar di sini
8823924 setiap hari rtm dan tv3 menyerang peribadi saya dan selepas saya menang pun mereka masih tetap cuba untuk memburukkan imej saya
8823925 perdana menteri sudah hilang mandat dari rakyat dan timbalannya yang mengetuai kempen juga telah ditolak oleh rakyat
8823926 biar mereka sahaja yang melakukan perkara yang kotor dan jijik itu saya hanya akan berbahas tentang polisi yang kita lihat membebankan rakyat
8823927 saya diberitahu ada arahan agar siaran terus menerus menerusi rtm hanya dimulakan selepas saya mengangkat sumpah

8824048 nintendos idea of implementing support for nes snes and n64 games in the wii see our other
8824049 i was a little tired in the first half and couldnt get in the groove
8824050 i got going after my first shot in the second half thats when everything got flowing for me
8824051 our turnovers we only had 10 assists and not knocking down shots was the telltale story for us
8824052 we wanted to limit their touches and strengths and make them play our game
8824053 shes such a big target in the paint we did not want her to post up that deep
8824054 it is always a great game with the new york liberty
8824055 it looked like a game that everyone had a month off
8824056 to me the layoffs are not an excuse we just didnt play well
8824057 we just turned the ball over too much thats a key stat
8824058 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8824059 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8824060 from experience i realized that theres not a lot of information about the disease only 700 people in the united states get it
8824061 so i thought about what i could do to raise awareness and i came up with this crazy idea to do two triathlons in a week
8824062 people think i am stupid but if someone asks why then i can tell them about aplastic anemia
8824063 it was an eight month ordeal of not knowing if she was going to live

8824067 people want to know if there will be a carnival and i tell them no
8824068 this is an old fashioned celebration which will really focus on our history and the picnic is a true picnic there wont be any food for sale so bring a picnic basket
8824069 i think the celebration will say that were proud of our past and the blue collar workers who founded batavia and filled it with a lot of community spirit
8824070 marilyn robinson wrote it for the 150th celebration and it was never performed
8824071 she has been a great historian for batavia the pageant really puts batavias history into perspective
8824072 the celebration as well as the service gives us a chance to stop and think about the ideals and values that the people who settled this community brought with them
8824073 they were dedicated not only to literally building homes for themselves but to creating a community institution
8824074 i will tell the people at the worship service that the first public building in batavia was a school it wasnt a tavern or a church it was later used for civic gatherings and for church services but it was built as a school in 1834 just one year after christopher payne settled here it indicates that there was a concern for the common good
8824075 it is a reminder to all of us that we are part of a community that reaches not only laterally from neighbor to neighbor but historically from generation to generation
8824076 as a member of the citys leadership team its humbling to think that we are stewards of a community that has existed for so long but we are also reminded that the implications of what we do today will have an impact far into the future
8824077 this year were basically trying to recreate floodfest because we got flooded out last year

8824085 the cuts have to do with the budget what happened last night doesnt change the fiscal shape that we were in when the budget came in out of balance not sure how you make that connection
8824086 i dont believe were in a financial position to even entertain an idea like that
8824087 i dont think we should be talking to the extent of committing village dollars
8824088 this incident could have been an incident that shattered our lives but we were spared
8824089 from the bottom of my heart i just want to thank you all
8824090 just knowing that i saved the girls life was a big enough award
8824091 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it feels amazing
8824092 i never thought something like this would happen to me in my first year of life guarding and that id manage to step up to the task to help the family
8824093 but its always refreshing whenever young people are doing extraordinary things

8824101 some christian traditions have it that at the last supper judas the disciple who betrayed jesus was the 13th to sit at the table and that for this reason 13 is considered to carry a curse of sorts triskaidekaphobia may have also affected the vikings it is believed that loki in the norse pantheon was the 13th god more specifically loki was believed to have engineered the murder of baldr and was the 13th guest to arrive at the funeral this is perhaps related to the superstition that if thirteen people gather one of them will die in the following year this was later christianized in some traditions into saying that satan was the 13th angel another norse tradition involves the myth of norna gest when the uninvited norns showed up at his birthday celebration thus increasing the number of guests from ten to thirteen the norns cursed the infant by magically binding his lifespan to that of a mystic candle they presented to him

8824170 wij zijn de partij van roosevelt en van kennedy dus vertel me niet dat democraten niet in staat zijn om het land te verdedigen als commander in chief zal ik niet aarzelen om ons land te verdedigen maar ik stuur onze troepen op gevaarlijke missies met de gevechtsuitrustingen die zij nodig hebben en met de zorg die ze verdienen als ze terugkomen
8824171 i have agreed in principle to accept the december 6 fight against oscar de la hoya this will be the toughest test in my boxing career because of the reach and height advantage of my esteemed opponent aside from his great boxing skills
8824172 this fight however will not be a walk in the park for oscar de a hoya boxing fans will see the same fire and intensity which they have witnessed in my previous fights i will frustrate the desire of oscar de la hoya to avenge the defeats of the great mexican boxers who lost to me
8824173 i am dedicating this forthcoming fight to my countrymen and all the boxing fans all over the world
8824174 i came here with just one mission in mind to win the title
8824175 you have to kill me first before you get this title i will meet you tomorrow and be sure to be ready because i am
8824176 i would like to thank ala promotions for this opportunity to fight your champion i am fully prepared for this fight and on saturday i am going to win the title
8824177 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8824178 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8824179 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8824180 this fight will have the whole world talking and will be a fantastic night for boxing oscars career has always been defined by taking on the biggest challenges and fighting best names in boxing this fight against a great champion like manny pacquiao is just another testament to his readiness to face the strongest competition and continue his legacy as one of the greatest fighters boxing has ever seen
8824181 this fight is what all sports fans are looking forward to a contest between two champions who come to fight and who are the most popular names in boxing today manny pacquiao is taking on a major task in facing the legendary oscar de la hoya but we at top rank are very confident manny will handle himself extremely well
8824182 mgm mirage has hosted the greatest names in sports and entertainment and this event will certainly continue that tradition we look forward to presenting one of the most exciting promotions in the history of boxing and there is no question this fight will have a major impact on fans worldwide
8824183 de la hoya pacquiao is a dream match up which will capture the imagination of sports fans everywhere its the pay per view king vs the pound for pound king and an event in which both fighters popularity clearly transcends the sport
8824184 de la hoya and schaefer will make announcement regarding ten time world champions immediate future
8824185 me and baat were very happy after the win especially because for the first time in our lives we saw a very very beautiful belt
8824186 we enjoyed the moment in our room the two of us took turns taking photos together with the belt but at 3am the promoter knocked on the door and took the belt away from us
8824187 my boxer may not own another belt in his lifetime now we have this very beautiful belt by winning the fight legitimately and we cannot bring the belt
8824188 i personally believe pacquiao can beat him not necessarily because of the superior skills of pacquiao but the receding talent of the golden boy
8824189 he was there but couldnt throw punches it was the same with roy jones jr against antoniotarver he couldnt throw his punches anymore
8824190 something happens to the body that after a while the reflexes slow down and what a fighter used to do can no longer be done but no fighters ever realize that until its over
8824191 just right and he will be at his prime while after another year he will also start going down
8824192 pacquiao will need to fight three or four times to get what he will earn against de la hoya its a no brainer
8824193 mccain wont even follow bin laden to the cave where lives
8824194 trying to hold onto a house and keep a family together
8824195 this now makes it complete this is an important day for the mission because we do not actually have an idol now
8824196 it just signifies the concepts that we are learning it also inspires devotion and it inspires that love for god whatever that means to each person
8824197 we just enjoy coming here and learning about our vedanta and literature
8824198 the main thing is there is a place we can call our own
8824199 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8824200 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8824201 i told her she gave me my son back it was something i needed to say
8824202 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8824203 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8824204 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8824205 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat
8824206 what this takes is some real fighters to oppose it on behalf of the communities involved
8824207 i have found no benefit for the people of the 14th district in this proposed merger
8824208 clearly that proposal is well short of the requirement to significantly minimize any negative impacts this sale might bring about
8824209 instead of having an east to west problem youll have a north south east and west problem
8824210 there could be significant railway bottlenecks without some significant financial rebuilding of the rail system im not so sure that you dont answer one problem with this move but put three more on the table in doing so
8824211 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
8824212 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8824213 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8824214 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
8824215 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
8824216 trying to be voice of community to bring people in and engage people who feel a digital divide who feel excluded from technology our core user group
8824217 its a platform for people to come together and make a community on their own terms its not about us dictating what the community will be but consulting with community to see what they need
8824218 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
8824219 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
8824220 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
8824221 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
8824222 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
8824223 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
8824224 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
8824225 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
8824226 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
8824227 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
8824228 it is also an opportunity to equip those students who plan to relocate to grand cayman to further their studies with some of the basic training they would need to be able to work part time in the media field
8824229 having a career in the media such as a talk show reporter or radio announcer will furnish some level of flexibility for those wishing to work and study at the same time
8824230 the students have adjusted and have shown a lot of interest in what has been taught over the course of the week they also have a manual from bbc radio to constantly refresh their memory on what they have learnt
8824231 i have learnt how to write an interview express myself and this experience has also helped me in speech presentation
8824232 i enjoyed the camp but i really want to explore the medical field while studying this could be an intermediate opportunity to even learn more about the field
8824233 young people are an important aspect for any countrys development and im happy for all those who played a special part in this years summer programme
8824234 in any similar organization the management makes plans and schedules which are based on availability of adult instructors and supervising staff the cicc is lucky to have a number of individuals who commit their time week after week and help in a number of ways and they must be commended
8824235 camps involve a lot of hard work they are certainly not a vacation and many volunteers find it difficult to be able to commit their entire vacation and may opt for a few days rest to recover
8824236 i will be involved with the cicc occasionally in the background and im only a phone call away for any of those senior cadets who need assistance from time to time
8824237 the senior cadets are now able to teach the junior cadets to attain a higher level they have good supervisory leadership skills and they have been involved with the management of the last few camps
8824238 i am very proud of the cadets who i have been involved with and believe that many of them have already benefitted from their experiences and training which have been given to them
8824239 the army cadet force manual upon which the practices of the cadet corps are based calls for a 1 10 ratio between cadets and adults because our current staff totals only seven and because the numbers of different roles are many and varied the volunteer cadre plays a most significant role
8824240 it should also be noted that the cadet corps in cayman is very young with only six years of experience and therefore relies heavily on personnel with military experience from overseas
8824241 persons like mr larner who served for over 12 years in the british military at the training depot and parachute regiment bring a vast amount of pertinent experience that adds value flavour and adventure to the cadetting experience in grand cayman pulled alongside the experience of others from multi lateral forces the corps is able to achieve balance and build a practice of excellence

8824247 meditation has not only given me special insight into present reality but it has also enabled me to look into my past incarnation
8824248 as the meditator realises his private reality to be devoid of self and ever changing he is led to a state of detachment from the world of experience
8824249 feelings of dread despair and misery cease body pains are absent entirely
8824250 equanimity prevails towards all external objects having no feelings for the self his acts are purely functional either for maintenance of his body or for the good of others for the
8824251 the least tendency toward an unvirtuous thought or deed is literally inconceivable
8824252 at least occasional sexual relations with one or more students
8824253 if experiencers awareness of the flow is significantly reduced as it is during sensory deprivation and other altered states they could easily conclude that their body boundaries were suddenly dissolving or that they were expanding or merging with other objects even with god or the entire universe
8824254 triple a is cheeseburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on a commercial flight in a middle seat between two random passengers
8824255 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
8824256 we could take the money were spending on this thing i dont like and spend it on these things i do like
8824257 mr president do you know how many hot school lunches your 100 million to the contras would buy
8824258 i do tip half as many as your 200 million for northern ireland
8824259 under george bush the middle east has become more troubled
8824260 remember our soldiers having to search through garbage dumps to find armor for their humvees
8824261 george bush and john mccain were wrong about going to war in iraq are wrong about how to get us out of iraq wrong to ignore the danger in afghanistan
8824262 we will once again live up to the full meaning of our creed one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice not just for the fortunate not just for the few for all
8824263 gago singapore and philippines i was in two countries last april
8824264 he gave me direction hope for a strong united states a strong work ethic i thought it was all there theres that deep belly fire i saw in him hes very committed to what hes saying the heart of this country is the middle class and for eight years theyve been let down it wasnt just what he said but how he said it you dont practice that its just there
8824265 tonight for what has to happen is a nuts and bolts speech he has to give a detailed more nuts and bolts specific speech that tells us what a barack obama white house would look like and what policies he would implement he needs to talk about the economy about getting out of the war in iraq and what he plans to do with afghanistan
8824266 for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8824267 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8824268 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8824269 which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8824270 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8824271 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8824272 it was a tremendous speech i cant envision anyone else standing up there for an hour and doing what he just did
8824273 he went after bush and mccain so he showed what he was against the second part was almost a laundry list of polices and the kind of issues he would be look at from tax breaks to lowering health care premiums and then he came back to the promise of post partisan politics which we havent heard about for awhile he did a better job of defining himself than the democrats have but he still has a lot of work to do one speech doesnt define a candidacy
8824274 i stand here tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier
8824275 from the lands that stretch three thousand miles behind us the pioneers gave up their safety their comfort and sometimes their lives to build our new west
8824276 some would say that those struggles are all over that all the horizons have been explored that all the battles have been won that there is no longer an american frontier
8824277 but i trust that no one in this assemblage would agree with that sentiment for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960s the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils the frontier of unfilled hopes and unfilled threats

8824285 i would love to get revenge for all mexicans whove fought against manny if you ask me that would be my choice because hes considered pound for pound champion of the world and we can meet half ways and make a big fight out of it manny holds that mythical title now so all right prove it hes exciting hes strong hes fast i believe the odds came out at two to one so why not
8824286 oh absolutely its a huge opportunity and not only monetarily wise but exposure because the whole world will be watching this fight
8824287 i can make one forty seven with no problem i went up six weight classes so its not impossible roy jones went up to heavyweight and he won the title so in the history of boxing its been proven that the smaller guy jumps up three four or five weight classes and can be successful so this wouldnt be the first
8824288 freddie roach is already talking that i cant pull the trigger well if this fight happens you watch ill pull the trigger
8824289 it was something that oscar took personally and it was something that hurt him because he left freddie on good terms after freddie helped him for the fight with mayweather and to be coming from a guy like freddie who he considers a friend it was hurtful oscars going to try to prove him wrong so lets see
8824290 the truth is in the numbers oscar should be getting the lions share the most mannys ever made is four times less than what oscars made in his last five fights average so you really cant compare apples and oranges and manny has to understand that this is a great opportunity for manny if he really wants a worldwide event where hes going to get exposure from all over the world hes got to take this fight the ball is on his side of the court and hes got to make it move
8824291 i think that was a bit disrespectful from freddie roach but if this fight happens they will be able to see how oscars still able to pull the trigger
8824292 i think thats very dangerous but sometimes people let their ego get in the way and they loose the perspective
8824293 the fact is that in a fight manny pacquiao makes two and a half three or three and a half million dollars if he goes in against say juan manuel marquez or erik morales maybe he makes four and half or five million dollars ok so now if he goes and fights oscar hes guaranteed ten million dollars and can potentially make fifteen sixteen or more depending on how the pay per view numbers are under that seventy thirty deal its a little bit difficult to understand why somebody would turn that down it certainly isnt because of money because he makes three or four times more so i dont know maybe hes scared fighting oscar there must be a reason why he hasnt said yes
8824294 i got a call in the last couple of days from roy jones if he wins against calzaghe hes interested then of course you have sergio mora and sugar shane mosley who would love to have another opportunity to fight oscar i dont know how long floyd mayweathers going to stay in retirement and margarito so theres a long list
8824295 i think oscar feels pretty passionate about seeing if he can get a pacquiao fight done because as he said its personal for him as manny has destroyed most of the mexican greats of our generation and now he oscar feels it stops with him
8824296 im continuing conversations with bob arum and well see where itll lead we hope that maybe as early as thursday we might have an announcement
8824297 wherever it is we will go and mthalane will be ready

8824335 we were monitoring the progress and movement of the storm closely very much like others in the cayman islands
8824336 we were prepared as needed and were ready to mobilise all residents
8824337 our shelters are ready to roll if we need them
8824338 we maintain a state of readiness throughout the year we do not wait for a storm threat
8824339 its important that the sister islands can respond on their own and they do have the capacity
8824340 they did what was necessary including taking the appropriate steps in terms of alerting persons and other measures
8824341 tropical storm fay provided an opportunity for us to go through hurricane preparedness procedures at the national level including close liaison with the meteorological office and the sister islands emergency committee
8824342 releases were prepared and regularly issued by the jcs to all local media for dissemination
8824343 throughout the storm watch and warning emergency personnel were also able to log onto the national emergency operations centre website for frequent updates on the weather changes as they happened
8824344 at the same time the general public was able to receive read current releases through the media and to get access to the most recent weather reports at the government website

8824360 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8824361 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8824362 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer

8824447 what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

8824460 though stronger evidence of this horrid practice prevailing among the inhabitants of this coast will scarcely be required we have still stronger to give
8824461 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
8824462 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
8824463 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
8824464 the signs of warfare related cannibalism among the anasazi are an interesting story in themselves while everyone acknowledges that cannibalism may be practiced in emergencies by desperate people such as the donner party trapped by snow at donner pass en route to california in the winter of 1846 47 or by starving russians during the siege of leningrad during world war ii the existence of non emergency cannibalism is controversial in fact it was reported in hundreds of non european societies at the times when they were first contacted by europeans within recent centuries the practice took two forms eating either the bodies of enemies killed in war or else eating ones own relatives who had died of natural causes new guineans with whom i have worked over the past 40 years have matter of factly described their cannibalistic practices have expressed disgust at our own western burial customs of burying relatives without doing them the honor of eating them and one of my best new guinean workers quit his job with me in 1965 in order to partake in the consumption of his recently deceased prospective son in law there have also been many archaeological finds of ancient human bones in contexts suggestive of cannibalism
8824465 the virus causing laughing sickness kuru in the new guinea highlands used to pass to a person from another person who was eaten it was transmitted by cannibalism when highland babies made the fatal mistake of licking their fingers after playing with raw brains that their mothers had just cut out of dead kuru victims awaiting cooking
8824466 far from glorifying peoples of western european origin we shall see that the most basic elements of their civilization were developed by other peoples living elsewhere and were then imported to western europe third dont words such as civilization and phrases such as rise of civilization convey the false impression that civilization is good tribal hunter gatherers are miserable and history for the past 13 000 years has involved progress toward greater human happiness in fact i do not assume that industrialized states are better than hunter gatherer tribes or that the abandonment of the hunter gatherer lifestyle for iron based statehood represents progress or that it has lead to an increase in human happiness my own impression from having divided my life between united states cities and new guinea villages is that the so called blessings of civilization are mixed for example compared with hunter gatherers citizens of modern industrialized states enjoy better medical care lower risk of death by homicide and a longer life span but receive much less social support from friendships and extended families
8824467 modern stone age peoples are on the average probably more intelligent not less intelligent than industrialized peoples
8824468 n atural selection promoting genes for intelligence has probably been far more ruthless in new guinea than in more densely populated politically complex societies where natural selection for body chemistry was instead more potent there is also a second reason why new guineans may have come to be smarter than westerners modern european and american children spend much of their time being passively entertained by television radio and movies in the average american household the tv set is on for seven hours per day in contrast traditional new guinea children have virtually no such opportunities for passive entertainment and instead spend almost all of their waking hours actively doing something such as talking or playing with other children or adults almost all studies of child development emphasize the role of childhood stimulation and activity in promoting mental development and stress the irreversible mental stunting associated with reduced childhood stimulation this effect surely contributes a non genetic component to the superior average mental function displayed by new guineans that is in mental ability new guineans are probably genetically superior to westerners and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up
8824469 arithmetic suggests that if england had been the size of the triple alliance it would have executed on average about 7 500 people per year roughly twice the number cort s estimated for the empire france and spain were still more bloodthirsty than england according to braudel in their penchant for ceremonial public slaughter the alliance and europe were more alike than either side grasped in both places the public death was accompanied by the reading of ritual scripts and in both the goal was to create a cathartic paroxysm of loyally to the government in the mexica case by recalling the spiritual justification for the empire in the european case to reassert the sovereigns divine power after it had been injured by a criminal act most important neither society should be judged or in the event judged each other entirely by its brutality who today would want to live in the greece of plato and socrates with its slavery constant warfare institutionalized pederasty and relentless culling of surplus population yet athens had a coruscating tradition of rhetoric lyric drama and philosophy so did tenochtitlan and the other cities in the triple alliance
8824470 cut short by cort s mexica philosophy did not have the chance to reach as far as greek or chinese philosophy but surviving testimony intimates that it was well on its way
8824471 finally we should mention the state cult of huitzilopochtli the ancient tribal deity of the aztecs he had taken on the attributes of the sun god worshipped by the earlier inhabitants of the valley as the supreme war god and as the sun itself his worship demanded the daily sacrifice of brave captives taken in war so that the solar orb could blaze forth at dawn each day if this failed to happen the fifth sun would end in universal disaster this was the raison d tre of the aztec human sacrifice not blood lust nor a predilection for cruelty nor an obsession with death but a fear lest the world and the life on it should perish
8824472 the great temple at the center of the capital was actually divided into two halves at the summit of one half was the temple of tlaloc god of rain and agriculture while the other half was dedicated to huitzilopochtli patron of warfare and of the sun its steps splattered with the blood of sacrificial victims the aztecs were fond of contrasts of this sort the warriors were the backbone of the aztec state and were graduates of the telpochcalli the military academy armed with shield darts to be hurled from spearthrowers lance and the macuauhuitl the terrible flat wooden war club set along the sides with razor sharp obsidian blades they were well nigh invincible against their mesoamerican enemies when it was bent on conquest which was the case through much of aztec history the state could field very large armies and keep them supplied for long periods of time armies travel on their stomachs and the aztec army was no exception the staple ration on campaigns was toasted tortillas produced in great quantities by their women at home prowess and valor on the field of battle demonstrated by the taking of captives for sacrifice in the capital was rewarded with both social and economic advancement
8824473 in our more or less democratic society chocolate is something that is taken in liquid or solid form by members of every social level although the most expensive finest quality chocolates are necessarily consumed only by those with well lined pockets not so among the aztecs and other mesoamericans our sources unanimously declare that the drinking of chocolate was confined to the aztec elite to the royal house to the lords and nobility to the long distance merchants and to the warriors the only commoners who had a chance to try this luxury seem to have been soldiers on the march
8824474 the medical knowledge brought by the spaniards to the new world was largely ineffectual in contrast while the aztec ticitl or doctor used a good deal of magic in his or her cures and while aztec disease etiology also had an overall theoretical scheme made up of contrary principles such as hot vs cold native medical practices were light years ahead of the spaniards this was due in large part to their incredible knowledge of the plant world included within the empires frontiers
8824475 aztec disease etiology bore little resemblance to the galenic nonsense of the europeans for instance fevers were not necessarily hot and were often cured not by administering cold medicines but by giving the patient hot medicines to induce sweating excellent medical practice as we now know
8824476 we can afford at times to chuckle over the naivet of this theory and practice but consider the medical horrors that were faced by our baroque age europeans no one had any real idea of disease etiology what caused infections epidemics and plagues why women often died of childbed fever and so forth knowledge of anatomy and physiology was just beginning but had little effect so far on medical practice surgery was carried out without anesthesia or antiseptics necessarily at great speed and if patients failed to succumb to loss of blood or from shock at least half of them later fell victim to septecemia and gangrene as we have said european knowledge of plants which might have been efficacious in some diseases was pathetic compared to that of the new world natives whom they had fairly well destroyed by this time in these circumstances it was only natural that sick persons and those treating them would grasp at straws in this case the much flawed system of hippocrates and galen and pray to the saints the introduction and spread of chocolate in europe can only be understood in this context
8824477 chocolate helped pave the way for coffee by creating a craving among consumers for dark bitter sweetened hot stimulant drinks chocolate like the caffeinated drinks that followed it may have also increased demand for sugar since it was an important vessel for sugar
8824478 chocolate was not a regular trade item until the 1590s the first work about chocolate to be published with a spanish readership in mind was printed in 1624 by the 1620s thousands of pounds of cacao and chocolate were imported into spain annually venezuela exported more than 31 000 pounds between 1620 and 1650 and more than 7 million pounds between 1650 and 1700
8824479 the work of sociologist pierre bourdieu is both illustrative and influential in distinction a social critique of the judgment of taste bourdieu actively disputed platonic and kantian traditions whose heirs are biological determinists that accept a natural and universal capacity to discern the inherently beautiful or excellent instead he sought to show the contingent and contextual basis of aesthetic determinations his thesis is that taste classifies and it classifies the classifier social subjects classified by their classifications distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make between the beautiful and the ugly the distinguished and the vulgar in which their position in the objective classifications is expressed or betrayed bourdieu argued that seemingly subjective pleasures accord with social hierarchies the particular form that the human capacity to discriminate between sights sounds touch and flavor alias taste takes at a given historical moment he affirmed serves the interests of those in power echoing the findings of sociologists from thorstein veblen to bourdieu cultural historians by and large have eschewed biological or economic determinism and instead theorize taste as socially constructed
8824480 the most famous modification was the addition of sugar contrary to the popular view that the spanish invented the idea of sweetening cacao native mexicans and mayans already sweetened many of their cacao beverages with honey since the spanish recognized both sugar and honey as sweeteners switching one for the other represented a slight modification but not a major divergence from the concoction as they had first tasted it
8824481 spaniards experimented with substitutes for old world spices but when they did so their aim was to approximate original flavors not to introduce new palate sensations the view that spanish improved on the chocolate of pre hispanic america is found in self justifying spanish texts by the eighteenth century that chocolate had conformed to european taste was a myth that supported the spanish ideology of conquest it presupposed that the colonists brought their civilization to barbarians rather than the opposite in fact europeans inadvertently internalized mesoamerican aesthetics and did not modify chocolate to meet their existing tastes rather they acquired new ones a reality at odds with colonial ideology
8824482 all preserved ancient maya writing constituting a total of about 15 000 inscriptions is on stone and pottery and deals only with kings nobles and their conquests there is not a single mention of commoners when spaniards arrived the maya were still using bark paper coated with plaster to write books of which the sole four that escaped bishop landas fires turned out to be treatises on astronomy and the calendar the ancient maya also had had such bark paper books often depicted on their pottery but only decayed remains of them have survived in tombs
8824483 archaeologists for a long time believed the ancient maya to be gentle and peaceful people we now know that maya warfare was intense chronic and unresolvable because limitations of food supply and transportation made it impossible for any maya principality to unite the whole region in an empire in the way the aztecs and incas united central mexico and the andes respectively captives were tortured in unpleasant ways depicted clearly on the monuments and murals such as yanking fingers out of sockets pulling out teeth cutting off the lower jaw trimming off the lips and fingertips pulling out the fingernails and driving a pin through the lips culminating sometimes several years later in the sacrifice of the captive in other equally unpleasant ways such as tying the captive up into a ball by binding the arms and legs together then rolling the balled up captive down the steep stone staircase of a temple
8824484 the ancient maya developed a complex society renowned for its monumental architecture colossal sculptures and portable carvings that adorned their towns and the bodies of the elite for scientific and intellectual achievements in mathematics astronomy philosophy and for the only true writing system that is the graphic representation of spoken language in the ancient americas during the classical period apogee a d 250 900 of the maya culture artisans created copious objects in a variety of media that were essential components of the sociopolitical and economic systems of the ruling elite m d coe and j kerr 1998 among these artefacts were decorated pottery vessels for serving food especially vessels for kakaw chocolate beverages reents budet 1994a unlike their ceramic predecessors of earlier centuries 1200 b c a d 150 which were characterized by elegantly simple forms and monochrome or occasionally bichrome slip painted surfaces classical period elite service wares were elaborately embellished with painted incised or modeled imagery or various combinations of these skilled painters adorned the service wares with renderings of elite life and portraits of powerful rulers they also portrayed the supernatural beings and religious myths that explained the universe and the place of the mayas therein
8824485 during late postclassical times and continuing into the colonial period kakaw beans functioned as an abstract representation of value that is as money for example in the markets of tenochtitlan the capital of the aztec empire the beans could be exchanged for any number of commodities they also served as payment for work service and to buy ones way out of forced labor slavery s d coe and m d coe 1996 98 99 kakaw beans were the preferred payment for tax or service obligations because they were a readily convertible capital medium in most of the prevailing economic systems of the myriad cultures of mesoamerica and also of those to the south in central america
8824486 the importance of cacao in classic maya society was not widely appreciated until the decipherment of glyphic texts on ceramics in the 1980s when it became clear that seemingly countless ceramic vessels were inscribed with a dedicatory formula identifying them as drinking vessels for chocolate d stuart 1986 1988 1989 now scholars readily see chocolate as a key element of courtly life having a profound role in political economics and display feasting events and ritual chocolate even permeates many examples of maya religious iconography
8824487 cacao was also associated with blood and sacrifice in the pre columbian period for mesoamerican peoples blood was an important offering to the gods not only were animals sacrificed but people particularly elites and rulers offered their own blood and that of human captives
8824488 the people of cholula mexico made a cacao beverage from water in which knives used in human sacrifice had been washed acosta 2002 1590 325 in the florentine codex sahag n 1950 82 book 6 1969 256 records that heart and blood were metaphors for cacao because it was precious j eric s thompson 1956 100 proposed that hearts and cacao pods share associations because both are the repositories of precious liquids blood and cacao rosemary joyce has suggested that the frequent exchange of cacao in marriage ceremonies may signify the mixing of bloodlines meskell and joyce 2003 139 140 a range of images supports the association of cacao with sacrifice and blood a stela from the archaeological site of santa lucia cotzumalhuapa on the pacific coast of guatemala depicts a human figure sacrificing a cacao pod as though it were a human heart the cacao pod spouts a liquid substance in mixtec codices bleeding cacao pods are depicted both on the tops and insides of temples which were places of sacrifice mary e smith 1973 236 in the sixteenth century diego garc a de palacio wrote that in pre columbian times the pipil people in nicaragua marked war captives for sacrifice with strands of cacao seeds feathers and green stones
8824489 the spaniards encountering motecuhzomas court for the first time were impressed by the lavish feasts and the strange beverage cacao which was consumed in large amounts curiously they overlooked that cacao was sometimes mixed with blood and offered in rituals while amaranth grain which was also offered in a mixture with human blood was outlawed balick and cox 1996 it is likely that cacao escaped amaranths fate because of its economic value both as a currency within the region and as a prized comestible as m j macleod 1973 70 noted the mexica had a developed cacao tribute system in place when the spanish arrived and the conquerors were able initially to take over this profitable system at least until disease killed many of the growers the mesoamerican people were forced to convert to christianity by the spanish conquerors but they frequently retained many practices of their native religion
8824490 we have learned that the spaniards had stripped it of the spiritual meaning which it had for the mesoamericans and imbued it with qualities altogether absent among the aztecs and maya for the invaders it was a drug a medicine in the humoral system to which they all adhered it is hardly surprising to find that it was under this guise that chocolate traveled in europe from one court to another from noble house to noble house from monastery to monastery but it soon became a medicine that was appreciated for its taste its filling nature and its stimulation are we shocked to learn that a medicine or drug with supposedly curative powers was converted to recreational use we should not be since the same transformation has taken place a number of times in modern europe and america the most famous case is that of coca cola which began life as a patent medicine in the american southland a sweet carbonated drink with a hearty dose of caffeine from the cacao related kola nut and a measure of cocaine gone from todays drink but the seed pod of the coca shrub is memorialized in the traditional shape of the bottle

8824537 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8824538 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8824571 the injunction is being sought so as to protect digicels rights pending a full hearing of the dispute before an arbitrator in london which is expected to take place later in the year
8824572 including confirmation received from both the wicb and stanford that another telecommunications company is seeking to become involved as a sponsor for the proposed event such an involvement by another telecommunications provider would constitute another further extremely serious breach of the sole and exclusive rights that digicel holds by virtue of its exclusive sponsorship agreement with the wicb
8824573 we are going to contest this injunction our attorneys in london are working on it our position remains the same
8824574 we are not part of this the stanford 20 20 match in that it is not our team it is not a west indies team that will be taking part so digicels rights are not infringed they are our sponsors but we disagree in this matter but we expect that common sense will prevail
8824575 however such support can only exist if digicels rights and entitlements are properly protected and observed the wicb has steadfastly refused to do so as such digicel has been left with no option other than to make this injunction application to the high court in order to protect its sole and exclusive rights as primary sponsor of west indies cricket
8824576 represents purports to represent or could reasonably be perceived as representing the west indies
8824577 the position of both the wicb and stanford is that the team that will play england on november 1 represents stanford and stanford alone
8824578 digicels position is that the 20 20 team is comprised of west indies players and must therefore reasonably be seen to be a team representing the west indies and not one solely representing the interests of a private individual
8824579 is in direct contrast to the respect and protection of rights that has been afforded to the sponsors of the england team vodafone and which has been confirmed by both the wicb and stanford
8824580 have you ever had the occasion to confront them about their behavior
8824581 didnt figure they would much give a damn what i thought beside that they are in their own backyard
8824582 the point would be that there are certain ways in which one should conduct ones self in order to be good neighbors and it is my sincere opinion that since moving into their home our fine neighbors have fallen far short of any such conduct
8824583 just walk on over there and give them lessons in being neighborly
8824584 well it isnt that we are obligated to educate them in the ways of ethical conduct
8824585 but as good neighbors ourselves we should at least confront them and express our feelings otherwise whom are we to complain about their conduct if theyve hardly any way of knowing what we may find objectionable
8824586 so what are you going to do waltz on over there and voice your complaint
8824587 we are going to go over there together and voice our complaints
8824588 we both are their neighbors it will make a far greater impact if we go together
8824589 there wont be a confrontation of any kind we will merely ask them to tone it down a bit thats all
8824590 lattie and i are just going to have a little chat with our neighbors thats all
8824591 well okay but dont be long teresa has invited us for dinner tonight and its almost prepared
8824592 not so fast lets give it one more try shall we
8824593 my friend and i just wondered if we might have a word with you
8824594 heavens no they are quite nice yes quite nice indeed
8824595 however i do fear that perhaps its not quite appropriate for you to be displaying such fine and magnificent appendages here in the door way where young and innocent children might be traumatized by such a sight
8824596 well then why dont you guys come in so i dont have to
8824597 sid she wants to know what you want to drink
8824598 perhaps a spot of tits err tea tea yes tea would be nice
8824599 what you americans pass off as tea is simply horrendous
8824600 whoa careful sir thats some potent stuff you have there
8824601 and this time skip the tea its not at all palatable
8824602 now what was it you guys wanted to talk about
8824603 why i am certain that is the largest penis i have ever witnessed outside of a zoo is it natural
8824604 i have never seen anybody able to embarrass tim like that i loved it
8824605 i swear to god sweetheart at first glance i thought he was perched upon a tripod
8824606 do call me sidney my dear and i dont believe i caught your name
8824607 sally anne why thats a fine name im happy to make your acquaintance miss sally anne have i told you what fine and succulent breasts you have my dear
8824608 we have received a complaint from the people who live to the east about this party getting out of hand
8824609 you did say the house to the east had lodged a complaint is that correct officer
8824610 here in lies the mistake you see i am mr dupree and i live in the house to the east
8824611 it should be dreadfully obvious it was not i to have lodged such a complaint
8824612 these fine people are my friends i would never lodge a complaint against them
8824613 it seems that a mrs edna dupree wouldnt quite agree with your assessment of your friends
8824614 yup seems she demanded that we arrest the entire bunch of you
8824615 i can arrest you and take you in for indecent exposure
8824616 or i can take you by the ear and drag you over to your wife and let you explain to her why we found you naked in a hot tub surrounded by
8824617 my sergeant has just informed me that we cannot arrest you because when the judge sees just how little you have to expose hell throw it out of court due to lack of evidence
8824618 these threshold values let you decide how paranoid you want to be about accepting keys
8824619 in both cases higher values are more secure but also run the risk of incorrectly determining that a key is invalid
8824620 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered
8824621 unable to verify the identity of xyz com as a trusted site
8824622 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer
8824623 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
8824624 barack obama emailed your dad telling him how great you are
8824625 an intriguing possibility however is that caffeine can help prevent or ameliorate depression
8824626 if you give an athlete more petrol in the tank they will go further what weve done is to give them 50 60 per cent more petrol
8824627 it has been incredibly hard for exercise physiologists to help athletes in this way and its a dilemma that has occupied researchers for decades we asked athletes to ingest caffeine which has no nutritional benefit and the results were astounding
8824628 we found that the amount of carbohydrate that could be stored by the muscles when ingested along with caffeine was about 60 per cent higher than with carbohydrates alone
8824629 the practical outcome of that is that an athlete training or competing the next day will have a better training session or race
8824630 caffeine has a wonderful effect on both short term sprint performance and on endurance it is a remarkable drug that affects both ends of the spectrum
8824631 it is very unfortunate i was facing the bowling machine when one just kicked up and hit me smack on the hand
8824632 we have just learnt about dhawans injury and will get together and pick a replacement in the coming days if we feel the need for one
8824633 theyve got a lot of talent in their team if things go their way they can score a lot of runs in a short amount of time so our bowlers have to be on the mark
8824634 our bowling attack as we know is a little bit weaker and thats the area that we can be exposed
8824635 for me personally its not because bangladesh beat australia its because we took a team for granted
8824636 theres a lot of guys trying to cement their position in this one day team and we all have a lot to play for i think youll find itll be the other way youll see australia come out at 100 miles an hour from ball one
8824637 in that game and i can remember it pretty well the wicket played a few tricks early and we won the toss and bowled
8824638 if we can get a wicket like that out here that is better for us to bowl on then well be competitive and have a chance of winning the game
8824639 without a doubt the side that weve got now is a more talented side whether theyre as match hardened or as internationally match hardened is another thing but the ability that this side has got now is definitely for the future a far better side a far more naturally gifted side
8824640 i thought they were a little bit rusty which i expect them to be tomorrow but rusty is still pretty good
8824641 the only thing that will play into our hands a little bit is the fact that they havent been playing a lot of cricket and we have
8824642 its happened to the aussies before theyve had little breaks and it takes them a game or two to get going
8824643 were probably a little bit disappointed with the way we batted a few guys including myself were a little bit rusty our first hit out
8824644 i thought we bowled and fielded well but theres still some room for improvement for tomorrow
8824645 the guys obviously havent been at home sitting on the couch doing nothing the boys are pretty fit and healthy theres no real niggles among the guys
8824646 miss tapos na ang duty ko eto na yung next na shift siya na lang magtutuloy
8824647 dont worry i know the county administrator ill talk to him
8824648 the supreme court ruled that in the event of any major change within the eu that impacted upon irelands constitution the government would be obliged to get approval for that change from the irish people
8824649 there is a paradox that we teach other nations how to devise opt outs when we are trying to get rid of them ourselves
8824650 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet
8824651 kevin myers recent article on immigration understates the problem with nigerian immigration and social welfare benefits
8824652 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shiite muslims
8824653 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8824654 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8824655 the decision was made on august 21st and i dont know if he has received the message yet but we based our decision on the fact that he no longer lives in sweden that is the most common reason for revoking a permanent residence permit
8824656 continue the fight of the knights of the order of malta to defend christianity
8824657 in their appreciation of those honourable leaders of the north who have stood by justice and rights and who defended the causes of oppressed peoples especially in palestine and iraq the international committee of al qathafi award for peace of 2008 is awarded to the european leader and former prime minister of malta
8824658 international personalities bodies or organisations that have distinctively contributed to rendering an outstanding human service and have achieved great actions in defending human rights protecting the causes of freedom and supporting peace everywhere in the world
8824659 for the netherlands the territorial integrity of georgia within the internationally recognised borders also earlier recognised by russia remains the basis for a solution to this crisis
8824660 you dont make peace with your friends but with your enemies
8824661 we have no military forces we dont have anything other than the power of the word to influence other states or to influence decisions in a multilateral setting
8824662 the victims could give us good descriptions of the offender
8824663 around 2am police on patrol spotted a man at sk yen who began to run when he saw the police car he was apprehended and matched the descriptions
8824664 the popular initiative against the construction of minarets has been submitted in accordance with the applicable regulations but infringes guaranteed international human rights and contradicts the core values of the swiss federal constitution
8824665 such a ban would endanger peace between religions and would not help to prevent the spread of fundamentalist islamic beliefs
8824666 two of them have visited me this week and we have talked about their possible testimony
8824667 being headscarved i could not study in france where basic rights are being violated while here it is possible and normal
8824668 my colleague refused my regular visit to his class because of my headscarf
8824669 it is obvious that bkirki interferes in details of the political life whether this is its right or not is another issue
8824670 i use my food shop to sell the alcoholics because it provides a good incoming and help iraqis forget the daily problems and dangers in our country
8824671 i started to store and sell only for friends and now it has become a prosperous business it is too dangerous if fighters discover my hidden place however i have to take the risk because it is a good way to get easy money
8824672 we didnt have choice it was supposed that iraq had become a democratic country but fighter groups want to turn us into an iran without choice or democracy
8824673 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8824674 serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
8824675 i believe that caracas will become a first world city in 20 years
8824676 i have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which i will be calling on to assist in this
8824677 boris johnson made it clear during his election campaign that he did not want to be on the payroll of hugo chavez and did not believe a poor south american country should be subsidising one of the wealthiest cities in the world
8824678 ken livingstone is free as a private individual to offer his advice and services to whomever he wants
8824679 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8824680 we are trying to deal with the protesters as gently as possible we are persuading them to leave the compound and will not do anything to those who follow the court order
8824681 move in and circle around me we cant let them seize our stage too easily
8824682 governor stevenson youll have the vote of every thinking american
8824683 it was the liberals who started the nazi stuff with bush
8824684 that goes back at least as far as nixon in fact anyone that opposed roosevelt was fascist reagan was a nazi too
8824685 fair enough then why are you touching on that theme in liberty peak i dont want to stoop to their level
8824686 e mail to its supporters encouraging them to deluge the station with complaints
8824687 would reduce the character its more frightening because in a sense there is no mystery there he is exactly what he presents himself to be which is an anarchist

8824698 estou pronto a debater com john mccain quem tem mais condi es para ser o comandante em chefe
8824699 a promessa de que todos podem conquistar o seu sonho que coloca a am rica num lugar parte que atrav s do trabalho duro e do sacrif cio conquistamos os nossos sonhos individuais e continuamos unidos como uma fam lia para garantir o mesmo direito para a pr xima gera o para isso estou aqui esta noite para continuar uma hist ria de 232 anos em manter esse sonho aceso
8824700 o governo n o o culpado de todos os nossos problemas atuais mas o fracasso de responder o resultado direto de uma pol tica quebrada em washington e das pol ticas erradas de george bush
8824701 am rica n s somos melhores do que esses ltimos oito anos somos melhores do que isso
8824702 esse pa s mais decente do que um em que uma mulher em ohio perto da aposentadoria est a uma doen a de perder tudo que conquistou numa vida de trabalho
8824703 n s temos mais compaix o do que um governo que deixa veteranos de guerra dormindo nas ruas de nossas cidades
8824704 esta noite eu digo para o povo americano democratas e republicanos e indenpendentes chega
8824705 eu n o acho que john mccain n o se importa com o que est acontecendo nas fam lia americanas eu acho que ele n o sabe se soubesse n o diria que classe m dia quem ganha menos do que cinco milh es de d lares por ano se soubesse n o proporia bilh es de d lares de cortes de impostos para as empresas e nem um centavo para o trabalhador john mccain n o entende
8824706 e quando ou o uma mulher falar das dificuldades de come ar o seu pr prio neg cio lembro de minha av que lutou para passar de secret ria a gerente apesar de anos de ser deixada para atr s nas promo es pelo fato de ser mulher foi ela quem me ensinou a trabalhar duro foi ela quem deixou de comprar um carro novo ou um vestido para si para que eu pudesse ter uma vida melhor ele colocou todas as suas esperan as em mim eu n o sei que tipo de vida john mccain pensa que as celebridades t m mas essa foi a minha esses s o meus her is

8824708 john mccain disse que vai perseguir osama bin laden at o inferno mas nunca foi atr s dele na caverna em que ele vive
8824709 as a team we did all right there were two other teams and we did 25 minute cycles and played both teams twice
8824710 i didnt play the first one because there was a handful of guys the coach had to play that came from another school that only has like 5 guys in the club
8824711 fullback sucked outside center was all right and so was 8 i liked 8 the best i think outside center has a lot of potential for big plays if the team could do teamwork of any kind the play style is so dirty and unorganized that at outside center you dont do much so 8 was better but it was really frustrating and i expect that it will always be that way here because the other teams specifically direct their play away from me so its hard to actually do things like i can get to rucks and stuff but i rarely get to tackle anybody because they always send it away from me sometimes by game plan and sometimes it seems like because they are scared
8824712 today was the first time i felt that one of my best qualities leadership was really showing people were listening to me and i was able to get them motivated so we played really well the last two games
8824713 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
8824714 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
8824715 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
8824716 we are a team that is very young and new to the big scene
8824717 41 points is a lot better than 14 im sure of that an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
8824718 in this offense you dont know when someone is going to break a long run
8824719 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8824720 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8824721 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8824722 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8824723 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8824724 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8824725 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8824726 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8824727 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8824728 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8824729 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8824730 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8824731 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8824732 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8824733 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8824734 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8824735 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8824736 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8824737 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8824738 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8824739 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8824740 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8824741 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8824742 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8824743 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8824744 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8824745 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8824746 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8824747 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8824748 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8824749 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8824750 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8824751 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8824752 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8824753 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8824754 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8824755 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8824756 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8824757 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8824758 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8824759 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8824760 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8824761 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8824762 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8824763 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8824764 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8824765 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8824766 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8824767 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8824768 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8824769 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8824770 tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it

8824811 this is our national dress you dont see them much now in the summer but in the winter everyone wears them because it keeps the cold out
8824812 today the customers especially the foreigners prefer the imports god only knows why

8824820 the arts community in philadelphia becomes part of an international community
8824821 enriches our work here because our work feeds into other experiences

8824824 the opportunity to see new work its exciting what an amazing arts community
8824825 the idea is to take a chance its not always going to be great and its not always going to be memorable but it is always interesting
8824826 created a vibe for a mainstream audience to see the work we do
8824827 you can feel normal taking a risk and checking out unusual stuff you may not know you already like
8824828 the fringe is a whole other way to get people involved in a conversation about art
8824829 at other festivals i saw that what people really wanted each night was to just be together at a place where they could talk
8824830 to do your own thing thats the spirit of the fringe
8824831 the sophistication and the willingness to push the envelope i find that very attractive
8824832 the most important thing whether youre talking about a business or youre talking about a city is innovation you want to create a climate of innovation
8824833 the shows we make are being seen by the national and international community and taken to theaters and festivals worldwide

8824835 the festival means pushing ourselves youre encouraged to do risky work to go out on a limb and you get to see a whole range of different people taking risks nick stuccio has given us such an international face
8824836 in the taxonomy of english writing e m forster is not an exotic creature we file him under notable english novelist common or garden variety still there is a sense in which forster was something of a rare bird he was free of many vices commonly found in novelists of his unusual about forster is what he didnt do he didnt lean rightward with the years or allow nostalgia to morph into misanthropy he never knelt for the pope or the queen nor did he flirt ideologically speaking with hitler stalin or mao he never believed the novel was dead or the hills alive continued to read contemporary fiction after the age of fifty harbored no special hatred for the generation below or above him did not come to feel that england had gone to hell in a hand basket that its language was doomed that lunatics were running the asylum or foreigners swamping the cities

8824911 we are aware of the familys rehousing needs and are doing everything we can to help them
8824912 john had always had a keen interest in music but had never felt he was good enough to play he was 13 when he asked a music teacher to teach him the piano but was told not to bother because he was not in the school choir
8824913 that destroyed him and although he maintained his love of music his desire to play only came to the fore again when he retired he didnt have a formal training in music but wanted to promote this type of education after his death
8824914 it is a substantial boost for our school of wind brass and percussion
8824915 we wrote to mr nighy some time ago like we have done to a number of celebrities asking for support
8824916 he was appearing at the lowry and someone who has links to the club and ordsall also mentioned us to him
8824917 he wrote back months later apologising for the delay but he had been filming abroad
8824918 the donation from mr done went towards a 40 000 improvement to the boxing room we have also received equipment for the boxing from the army
8824919 we have raised about 375 000 now but some of the work that needs doing requires urgent attention so the cash is spent as it comes in for example revamping the kitchen and rewiring this week we will take delivery of a new boxing ring
8824920 the company went into administration on august 7 but we were hopeful it could be sold as a going concern
8824921 the hotels director had set up a new company and had run it for three weeks as far as we knew everything was fine
8824922 but on tuesday they informed us they were not in a position to continue with the sale and the whole enterprise collapsed
8824923 those who paid by credit card should contact their credit card companies but those who paid by cash cheque or debit card have lost their money and there is no prospect of getting it back
8824924 theres no good news in this story we usually get our kicks out of saving businesses but there are none to be got here
8824925 workmen were screwing boards up to the windows and doors
8824926 i couldnt believe it even the hotel sign had been taken down
8824927 there were no staff and the phone lines were disconnected
8824928 i have planned this day in my head since i was eight and we have saved really hard we are both devastated
8824929 it is awful a real mess the hotel was fully booked by our guests people were coming from a long way away
8824930 the most important day of my life has been shattered
8824931 we were impressed with the age of the building and it was romantic
8824932 the wedding will go ahead even if i have to have it in my back garden
8824933 it has become an annual excuse for the organisation behind pride to become dictators and revel in the power that they wield
8824934 little or no input is asked for or actually wanted from the very businesses that are the life blood of the whole event
8824935 small businesses sometimes rely on the big weekend itself to fund their contribution so therefore get absolutely no support no listings no encouragement and no help from pride because they havent paid up
8824936 what should be a community driven event is now a purely commercial operation established operators are shunned and overlooked for nonentity non gay organisations that just have bigger purses
8824937 many of the businesses in the village have already told us how happy they are with this years event
8824938 we consult with the village business association early in the planning process and we look forward to continuing that healthy dialogue
8824939 it was a complete success we can mention at least 20 venues who were completely happy and do not feel that phils letter comes from the majority of the village
8824940 it was not just jews at the camp there were gypsies and people who had protested against the regime people did not have enough food and were becoming ill and thin
8824941 the work done by pace over the last year has been the answer to a prayer
8824942 like many churches we are starved of funds so to have pace and remes efforts on our behalf highlights how lucky we are to have them in our community
8824943 i will not tolerate guns or drugs on the streets of manchester my priority is to get them off the streets save lives and lock up offenders
8824944 this operation along with other recent successes shows gmps determination to deal with gun crime
8824945 this has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of firearms incidents in the area
8824946 shortly after 5am on thursday 28 august 2008 police executed a warrant at an address on keddleston avenue longsight
8824947 nhs trusts are not buying and selling cornflakes we are providing a public service we want nhs trade unionists to be able to speak out when they have concerns about the impact of the private and voluntary sectors taking over the provision of health services
8824948 when he was diagnosed they said he might not be able to sit up because his spine might crumble
8824949 because of his bones they didnt know whether he would be able to crawl so for him to actually walk is brilliant
8824950 i follow him around but he walks on his own and its amazing we couldnt believe it
8824951 but at the back of my mind were still thinking that this could change at any minute
8824952 the other children can be really protective but he just pushes them as if to say let me get there on my own
8824953 he started trying to pull himself up on the chair and toy box because he wants to be where the other children are so his progress is kind of down to them
8824954 the way he has coped with it is just astonishing he is determined to beat it
8824955 he went from being so sporty and active to being completely shattered hed fall asleep during the day and lost about two stone
8824956 the tumour was 98 per cent dead so the op was a success he just has to get through a few more weeks of treatment
8824957 he was such an active lad hes sports mad and still holds the 100m record at alder he was destined to make it he cant wait to get back to school
8824958 i honestly think the damage caused by his fall could be linked to the tumour teenagers are susceptible to it
8824959 the strongest and most explicit stand supporting of life ever expressed by a major political party
8824960 you can never underestimate the stupidity of the buying public
8824961 why is it that people have such a deep seated need to show their utter stupidity
8824962 fear is a good trait to have it keeps you from getting killed
8824963 were here to demand justice to stop the raids they treat us like criminals but we are workers
8824964 were here on the third anniversary of elvira arellanos courageous decision to seek sanctuary in a church in chicago and to resist her deportation
8824965 we are demanding that the raids stop now mayor newsom wants to be governor so hes started scapegoating immigrants and is trying to end san franciscos sanctuary city policy but were not going to let him it is a long established policy in san francisco that began in the 1980s when refugees from el salvador fled their country seeking refuge from the american sponsored war and it should remain in place
8824966 a little bit but ive got to take the positives out of it
8824967 did i expect one play no i didnt but my legs are fresh and ill be ready to go
8824968 ive probably got the freshest legs out of everybody in this locker room
8824969 you all are veterans too veterans of the streets of denver
8824970 i thought i was serving my country now im home and im serving all the people of the world by ending this war obama says hes going to end the war and hes going to bring the veterans home so were waiting
8824971 but the secondary goal is to show that we have strength we have people we have power and we wont allow the media to block our message
8824972 but we need to protest this unjust war i hope that obama will change everything but i dont know hes certainly more likely to listen because of this protest
8824973 a lot of people may have been sitting on the fence before this but after this week people are more entrenched in the struggle i think more people have seen what it will take
8824974 but since obamas inspired people for change when he gets elected people will see him not coming through and his failures will inspire people that they need to fix it themselves
8824975 i want immigrants to get a better deal and i want them to pass the dream act
8824976 obama is in a hard situation even if he does want to pass something better he has to go through the democratic and republican legislators hopefully today well revive this issue for the election
8824977 it doesnt matter whos president but what people are doing
8824978 i think that there will be more protests if he gets elected and doesnt work for legalization i will ask people to vote in november but more importantly we have to mobilize in 2009
8824979 this is an issue ive been fighting for 10 years we need it to be raised on a national level rather than a local one obama hasnt really addressed this issue last march we had about 20 000 march for our day without a mexican to prove that migrants are needed in our economy and it would have a huge effect if they werent here
8824980 i wish we would have combined efforts with the anti war march yesterday

8825041 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8825042 basically they create a major humanitarian crisis for families and spouses and children
8825043 the question is what they are doing with people when they are arrested
8825044 its an immoral very anti human anti family act they split families and create terror in the latino community they go in shake down the plant put people in shackles and chains carry them to jail have them arraigned and often they are put in jails with real criminals
8825045 we are deeply concerned by reports that workers at the factory where the raid occurred were segregated by race or ethnicity and interrogated the factory was locked down for several hours workers were denied access to counsel and ice failed to inform family members and lawyers following the raid where the workers were being jailed

8825063 we were looking forward to the trip to cancun but with the severe weather in the area we decided it best to keep our team and student athletes out of potential harms way
8825064 we are disappointed but it is the right thing to do and we were able to get a few great days of practice in and get the freshmen on the court for one day as well were all really looking forward for the 2008 09 season and will get a chance to travel internationally before next year begins
8825065 you were not able to provide any documentary evidence even to confirm where they were purchased
8825066 a deterrent to other persons who might be tempted to run this sort of racket
8825067 the most recent research i have seen suggests a very high mortality rate at capture
8825068 by the time you get to the birds that make it into the trade there has been a lot of death and suffering thats unnecessary
8825069 the course lecturer told me that a lot of them had polish girlfriends
8825070 its a very challenging language to learn and the grammar is more difficult than german so youd have to be quite motivated to learn it although it might help having a girlfriend to practise with
8825071 i had been looking out for polish classes for years and was so excited when i saw the course
8825072 it was big sometimes you go to these classes and you only get a few people but there were about 18 people at the start of the polish classes and that went down to about a dozen by the end
8825073 there were lots and lots of men with polish girlfriends they had an unfair advantage as theyd go home and practise with them and come back improved the next week it was at least half the class
8825074 i think a lot of them will be back this year
8825075 there was even a guy there who had a lot of polish people as his customers in work and he wanted to learn some of their language
8825076 you hear about polish people learning english so its a bit different doing it the other way round
8825077 even just to say hello to a polish person in their language would be good we had some polish visitors to our class and they were really impressed we were learning it
8825078 i suppose its like going to a far away land and seeing people learning welsh

8825080 oh man sometimes it is a little hard for me
8825081 i thought there was water running on me down my face but in actuality it was blood from a man thats head was severed
8825082 i felt something tap me on the back of my neck and next thing i know i was on the floor
8825083 i heard a lot of screaming babies crying people yelling for help bulbs popping
8825084 and out of the darkness of dust i dont know how she seen me but there was a young lady that seen me and she came to my rescue
8825085 im thinking maybe somethings on my back thats too heavy for her to remove by herself
8825086 she bent back down and told me she said you are one of the injured people
8825087 the doctors would medicate me so i wouldnt have nightmares because i would wake up screaming yelling
8825088 but after i told them about the cause they got excited and promised to read more
8825089 im not interested in doing the least amount of work for this job
8825090 im interested in being a mentor and a role model ideally i want to inspire kids to one day take part in charitable work too

8825098 por lo que hay muchos estudiantes que vienen durante todos los meses de verano para recuperar las asignaturas que tienen para septiembre

8825103 los chicos est n bastante desmotivados y hay que animarlos para que estudien
8825104 esa es la nica manera de que den todo de s
8825105 a los opositores no nos queda otra que estudiar todos los d as y mucho si queremos aprobar
8825106 es el mejor lugar para estudiar porque ves al resto de la gente concentrada y te motivas m s para seguir
8825107 me gusta este sitio y la fuerza de la costumbre hace que ste sea el lugar donde mejor estudio
8825108 dos ma anas a la semana toca academia y por las tardes estudio por mi cuenta
8825109 s lo descanso los domingos y alg n que otro s bado
8825110 aunque a los opositores les da igual que sea verano o invierno s se nota que en los meses estivales hay menos gente de la habitual en las clases
8825111 no s si me dar tiempo a tenerlo todo bien estudiado para septiembre as que en el peor de los casos me sacar las materias en la convocatoria de final de a o
8825112 no tengo tiempo ni dinero para irme fuera por lo que todas las ma anas voy dos horas a una academia para preparar el ingl s y sacar el t tulo first
8825113 al final da igual quedarte sin verano o sin invierno porque lo importante es aprobar para luego poder hacer algo de tu vida afirma sandra somos muchos los que estamos igual y compartimos horas de estudio cuando aprobemos lo celebraremos juntos
8825114 en mi casa hay mucha gente y en la biblioteca me concentro mejor
8825115 un d a a la semana voy a una academia y despu s preparo por mi cuenta el temario en verano vengo mucho a la biblioteca porque hay m s gente en mi casa mis hermanos est n de vacaciones y hay m s movimiento por lo que no consigo concentrarme adem s ver a la gente estudiando me da m s ganas de seguir me motiva
8825116 voy a un preparador y aparte estudio por mi cuenta
8825117 voy a un preparador porque si no ser a muy dif cil sacar las oposiciones y a n as llevo dos a os sin tener vacaciones estudiando todas las semanas s que es cierto que en verano se toma de otra manera pero aunque me coja libre una semana y alg n que otro s bado no dejo los estudios de lado s lo descanso s bados y domingos
8825118 tengo mucho que estudiar y necesito la ma ana y la tarde
8825119 vengo ma ana y tarde a estudiar a la biblioteca porque me fue muy mal en junio y tengo que aprobarlo todo es mi primer a o de carrera y la estoy haciendo en madrid y ya se sabe tiene mucho para ver y disfrutar ahora me toca ponerme a estudiar pero los fines de semana son sagrados y aprovecho para salir y ver a los amigos
8825120 estoy todo el d a en la biblioteca ma ana tarde y casi noche

8825122 todas las ma anas voy a una academia y luego por las tardes vengo a la biblioteca a estudiar
8825123 cada a o que pasa el nivel de los chicos es m s bajo
8825124 los chavales que tenemos este verano est n mucho m s implicados que otros aunque se nota que los universitarios tienen m s inter s por aprender cada a o que pasa hay un nivel mucho m s bajo aunque vienen con pocas ganas luego se animan porque ven que pueden conseguir buenos resultados es cuesti n de ganas
8825125 las vacaciones van un poco a rebufo de las clases de los chicos
8825126 tener las tardes libres en verano est muy bien tenemos muy buen horario porque durante el curso damos clase por las ma ana y tambi n por las tardes adem s de las tardes libres las vacaciones las tienes un poco a rebufo de las clases de los chicos en junio justo al acabar el curso y en septiembre cuando acaban los ex menes
8825127 aunque este a o hay buenos chavales les cuesta estudiar
8825128 este a o los chicos se portan muy bien pero son bastante malos estudiantes pero algo es algo son buenos chavales que necesitan confiar un poco m s en ellos y estudiar un poquito m s aunque trabaje el verano se pasa bien porque tener las tardes libres es un alivio puedes hacer cosas y no est s todo el d a atada al trabajo
8825129 doy clases cursos de inform tica y adem s soy el t cnico
8825130 aparte de clases de inform tica tambi n doy cursos para parados del inem que suelen ser de mayo a noviembre por lo que de vacaciones poco tambi n soy el inform tico de la academia por lo que trabajo no me falta lo peor de trabajar en verano es el calor hace calor en todas partes y as es mucho m s dif cil trabajar
8825131 lo peor de trabajar en verano es tener que madrugar
8825132 y hay quien protesta y quien no por lo que decidimos no hacer nada por el momento
8825133 m s de una vez al d a y as es imposible
8825134 dejar el coche aparcado un momento a la entrada para poder cargar con las vajillas que compraron que incluso pueden pesar treinta kilogramos y ahora eso ya no lo pueden hacer
8825135 nos tienen que dejar las prendas en los bares del final de la calle explica y traerlas hasta aqu es un caos
8825136 porque son muchos ba les llenos de prendas hasta arriba
8825137 s hay que hacer ajustes no hay dificultades para hacerlo pero buscando un equilibrio razonable entre los distintos conceptos para que el modelo sea consistente
8825138 lo multilateral no es un problema que le guste o no es la doctrina vigente del tribunal constitucional del a o 2007
8825139 un nuevo modelo ser a muy dif cil de plantear
8825140 parece mentira que diga esas cosas y que lo haga seriamente
8825141 en lo que todos estamos de acuerdo es que la poblaci n juega un papel fundamental
8825142 en su expediente no constan sanciones y s varias notas meritorias tiene apoyo y vinculaci n familiar en el exterior
8825143 asume el delito cometido con adecuada asunci n de responsabilidades y no hace atribuciones externas que minimicen su responsabilidad personal
8825144 permite depositar en el interno la confianza necesaria para el disfrute del permiso solicitado y desvirt a las razones esgrimidas por la junta de tratamiento
8825145 cuenta con arraigo en espa a tanto en el plano familiar como profesional
8825146 se traslad al extranjero eludiendo temporalmente la acci n de la justicia espa ola y que al solicitarse su extradici n sta fue denegada pero tambi n consta que volvi a espa a de forma voluntaria
8825147 siempre pensando en galicia y sus gentes nunca como instrumento de ventaja pol tica
8825148 promet un gobierno estable y galicia tiene un gobierno estable promet el cambio y el cambio est en marcha
8825149 ahora ya no juego con ellas pero lo que m s me gustaba era su ropa y que eran modernas
8825150 son m s actuales y con ropa m s moderna que la barbie
8825151 la barbie siempre es lo mismo pero estas mu ecas son diferentes por ejemplo las hay especiales para que la peines y las maquilles algo que las otras no tienen
8825152 las dos mu ecas no se parecen las bratz son mucho m s modernas
8825153 s hay plagio porque la idea de la mu eca es la misma s lo cambia el estilo
8825154 la barbie es m s elegante siempre con sus trajes de noche
8825155 la idea de la mu eca es la misma s lo cambia el estilo
8825156 es s lo una moda la barbie est muy vista y a las ni as les gusta cambiar
8825157 son lo nuevo la otra ya est muy vista y a las ni as les gusta cambiar
8825158 la barbie ya est anticuada y el cuerpo no tiene nada que ver con el de las bratz
8825159 en este montaje no hay buenos y malos es el mal representado en todas sus vertientes
8825160 el miedo se transmite y los personajes lo tienen porque saben que tras la conquista de su poder hay muchas muertes
8825161 with the signing and approval process of this project now complete aricom looks forward to the commencement of construction and the consequent contribution to the groups revenue aricom is delighted to have chinalco as a joint venture partner
8825162 egal wie die entscheidung ausf llt unsere tests haben das interesse anderer stadtverwaltungen und etlicher ministerien geweckt
8825163 lo que quieren es depurar responsabilidades del gobierno local y el objetivo de la comisi n es informar no juzgar
8825164 hablar de las armas que se encontraron en el registro
8825165 es lo que ocurre cuando se gobierna en minor a
8825166 en el marco de la revisi n de la relaci n de puestos de trabajo
8825167 por fin hemos conseguido entre todos que touri o rectificase
8825168 resolviese el problema creado por l y por el psoe
8825169 agentes econ micos los agentes sociales el pp y los medios de comunicaci n
8825170 esta crisis pol tica creada por touri o y blanco les ha estallado en la mano
8825171 se hayan dedicado a polemizar sobre una decisi n no tomada
8825172 que cre el psoe sin raz n ni justificaci n
8825173 la gente quiere ver que su gobierno est actuando y yo me alegro de que por fin acabe esta triste historia y nos pongamos a trabajar
8825174 el psoe debe explicar por qu traslad a la sociedad un debate injustificado
8825175 touri o acaba de dar un golpe en la mesa y dejar claro que aqu manda l
8825176 lo que pas este mes de agosto no puede volver a repetirse
8825177 target each state according to its type we have several big working class and older states like pa and wv we have southern states like ky and nc each of these now has a basic campaign type we can build on economics in pa and wv stress commander in chief in southern states
8825178 you have nothing to fear from me contribute to my campaign ill be just as good on free trade as hillary clinton
8825179 its like two corporations trying to merge and one of the corporations doesnt really want to be taken over
8825180 the clinton corporation is hoping really that the obama corporation will bankrupt itself and fall apart and that they can resume their drive for power in four years
8825181 es imposible que un veh culo alcance los 120 kil metros por hora con el freno de mano puesto
8825182 esta velocidad es suficiente para que el avi n despegue por s solo
8825183 si el avi n despeg del suelo no hab a ninguna reversa activada porque entonces no podr a haber alcanzado la velocidad v1 y v2
8825184 es lo que quer amos y aqu estamos no s si seremos cabeza de serie en el sorteo pero espero que ahora nos enfrentemos a un equipo m s blandito el hajduk split no ha sido un mal equipo tiene gente interesante nos ha costado ganarle m s de lo que parece
8825185 en los primeros minutos tuvimos un par de equivocaciones y les dimos opciones pero a partir del minuto 20 empezamos a tocar no tuvimos ocasiones claras pero llegamos arriba el partido fue nuestro desde entonces cuando empezamos a combinar sab amos que ellos tendr an problemas porque adem s el campo no estaba bien para jugar ellos hicieron muchas faltas despu s el rbitro estuvo m s r gido y nosotros no ca mos en torpezas y seguimos jugando hemos merecido pasar esta eliminatoria
8825186 el equipo est contento hab a jugadores que debutaban en la copa de la uefa como antonio tom s y de guzman y que no hab an jugado el partido de ida han jugado bien y eso ha sido muy bonito para ellos
8825187 a ver si llegamos a casa ahora lo m s pronto posible
8825188 sergio jugar de inicio z castro tambi n algunos m s tenemos gente de refresco y nos queda poco tiempo piscu se retir con algunos problemas musculares pero no son importantes
8825189 traditionell laden wir weltber hmte schauspieler und schauspielerinnen als gaststars zu medium ein ich bin begeistert verk nden zu d rfen dass blythe danner fr h in der f nften staffel vorbeischauen wird
8825190 das vierte der m nchner tv sender hat mit der deutschen serie
8825191 das geld dass derzeit in unserem gesch ft verdient wird ist einfach zu viel es entspricht nicht dem was wir tun
8825192 rzte feuerwehrleute polizisten lehrer das sind die wahren helden unserer zeit ihnen steht mehr zu menschen die versuchen eine gesellschaft voran zu bringen haben es verdient
8825193 erkl rte der kanadische schauspieler gegen ber den san francisco chronicle 24 star kiefer sutherland ich verdiene einfach zu viel geld url http www serienjunkies de news kiefer sutherland 19261 html img http www serienjunkies de news thumb d1626092 thumb jpg img url
8825194 wir haben gerade das budget ermittelt und eigentlich sah alles ziemlich gut aus der neue hbo boss fand dann aber dass die serie zu d ster zu gewaltt tig und zu kontrovers ist was nat rlich die idee hinter der verfilmung war
8825195 es war eine wirklich gewissenhafte umsetzung der ersten b cher fast schon wort f r wort hbo bot mir zwar an es komplett umzuschreiben doch das lehnte ich ab denn das hatte ich schon einmal erfolglos gemacht das projekt ist also f r hbo gestorben
8825196 jemand sagte mir dass die comics nun in einen kinofilm verarbeitet werden ich hoffe dass das passiert ich hoffe dass es eine filmreihe wird denn in einem film kann man die story nicht umsetzen ich liebte die arbeit an dem projekt aber es sollte wohl nicht sein
8825197 denkt einmal dar ber nach du hast 100 bis 200 jahre zeit gehabt einen partner zu befriedigen
8825198 este es un congreso de muy bajo nivel con personas no calificadas adem s contribuye a su deterioro el hecho de que el propio congreso no ha sabido defender su imagen porque no ha aplicado sanciones r pidas y dr sticas a los que han cometido faltas
8825199 antes de pensar en el bienestar del pa s tiene que estar el bienestar tuyo
8825200 esos creo no son tr nsfugas si te vas por principios no pero creo que el tema pasa por el mismo gobierno el apra gan la elecci n con un programa determinado y ahora gobierna con otro entonces el partido de gobierno tambi n se volvi tr nsfuga aunque de sus filas nadie se haya ido
8825201 eso se sobredimensiona el verdadero tema es la deslealtad hacia los ciudadanos el n mero de bancadas termina siendo una cuesti n de forma pero las l neas pol ticas son las que importan el motivo real es la polarizaci n bloques que se enfrentan y eso genera inestabilidad aunque claro es verdad que la alianza apro fujimorista que controla las principales comisiones y la mesa directiva ahora se ha visto favorecida por muchos congresistas con tendencia pro aprista pero no es por la fragmentaci n en s sino porque se pretende seguir esa misma l nea pol tica ah tambi n hay polarizaci n por un lado est n el congreso y el gobierno y por otro los sectores sociales
8825202 hubo sectores que se sintieron fastidiados se nos tild de defensores del terrorismo y eso solo significaba que aquellos que nos llamaron as no hab an le do nuestro informe en el que la principal conclusi n fue la responsabilidad de sendero luminoso y la subversi n en las casi 70 mil muertes ocurridas en aquel periodo de tiempo pero tambi n se alamos que los partidos no salieron a defender sus ideas que las autoridades no se hicieron cargo del asunto que los militares se equivocaron de estrategia y usaron en determinado momento metodolog as que validaban a la subversi n al comportarse como ellos incluso hubo una cr tica de la iglesia muchos se sintieron tocados
8825203 en estos cinco a os se han hecho cosas como el pedido de perd n p blico por parte del ex presidente toledo quien tambi n estableci la ley que institu a el plan integral de reparaciones adem s de crear la comisi n multisectorial de alto nivel cman que deb a trabajar en las reparaciones el presidente garc a tom la posta respetando lo establecido e incluso dio un paso m s al crear el consejo nacional de reparaciones encargado de hacer el registro de v ctimas lo lamentable es la escasez de recursos con la que trabaja esta instituci n falta mucho por hacer
8825204 lerner el caviar n el ex jefe de la cvr quiere que se les pida perd n a los terrucos
8825205 tenemos una ley de reparaciones y una comisi n de reparaciones pero es poco el dinero dispuesto para implementar esto y creo que estamos atrasados en las reparaciones simb licas que son muy importantes porque les da sentido y valor a las v ctimas
8825206 quienes reclaman reconocimiento para las fuerzas armadas por su lucha contra el terrorismo demuestran que no han le do el informe
8825207 he stepped in and he did what he had to do
8825208 he always told us hed do it again without even thinking in a heartbeat
8825209 were forgetting these men served this country seven years ago before there was a war
8825210 gregs friends and loved ones should be incredibly proud of his service to our country
8825211 the front door and windows blew entirely out and there was flames coming out of the windows
8825212 the mother was screaming she was saying the baby is trapped up there
8825213 it feels like hell trying to get my daughter back for so long
8825214 they were there when she was born and they are the only parents that she has known
8825215 i didnt have a home when i was little i want her to do better
8825216 if family focus had done anything improper or illegal the court of appeals would not have reversed seven zip
8825217 nueva demostraci n de uso privado de lo p blico por inter s particular
8825218 no nos parece nada bien es un acuerdo que va en contra del beneficio general de los ciudadanos e incluso contra la libertad en el propio trabajo de los taxistas
8825219 el s bado por la noche la afluencia de gente es menor incluso los propios taxistas lo dicen
8825220 al final salimos perjudicados todos y las declaraciones del concejal nogueira como en muchas ocasiones no me parecen convincentes
8825221 estaba esperando que esta noticia fuera justo al rev s
8825222 es excesivamente corporativista aunque supongo que hay muchos taxistas que a t tulo individual no est n de acuerdo con esta normativa
8825223 lo que deber a hacer el concello es crear un servicio de taxis compartidos y m s baratos para los j venes
8825224 la bajada de usuarios del servicio de taxis durante el fin de semana sobre todo los s bados hace que no sea necesario un aumento del servicio
8825225 puede que haya menos gente que salga los s bados pero lo que es evidente es que los j venes no disponen de los suficientes medios para regresar a casa cuando salen
8825226 los autobuses nocturnos funcionan a medias y el ayuntamiento deber a reforzar este tipo de servicios muchos chicos dicen que el transporte p blico les deja muy lejos de casa y ahora se toma esta medida para dificultarles m s las cosas para volver a sus hogares de una forma segura y econ mica
8825227 puede traer consecuencias muy negativas en lo que respecta a los accidentes de tr fico
8825228 este acuerdo tampoco beneficia a las campa as que se est n realizando para conseguir que los j venes no beban y cojan el coche
8825229 ver n mermadas las oportunidades de disponer de este servicio
8825230 act e porque deber a impedir que los ciudadanos sufran las consecuencias de este acuerdo sin sentido

8825233 as ive been saying for years the library is becoming less relevant and no amount of hand wringing over what we can do to get people to use the library more is going to change that but librarians are more relevant than ever if only we can disengage ourselves from privileging our buildings and collections the way that we do and utilizing our individual skills in more effective and relevant ways

8825255 there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8825256 we are aware of the reports and we are looking at what can be done to identify the remains and establish whether they are of an australian and if they date back to the second world war
8825257 its too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death there were allied australian and american and japanese airmen who would have been flying over the area in the war
8825258 a number of allied aircraft had been reported as missing in the area in particular b25 mitchells and a number of kittyhawk aircraft

8825273 i dont think its appropriate for an anthologist to include his own poetry in the books he assembles one risks being a louis untermeyer my fingerprints are all over that selection as it is with the intro and the notes not to mention the poems themselves and the order in which ive placed them so it would be sheer egotism to include my own work as well it makes far too broad a target for someone looking to discredit the book or individual editorial choices within it
8825274 my heart a knot undone with pain forgot a beat the message cut

8825277 if you look at sub saharan african markets theyve given annual returns that are substantially better than most around the world
8825278 even this year most of the economies around the world are not seeing very much growth 2 percent would look optimistic whereas in africa its been around 6 percent for years one of the fastest growing economies in the world is actually angola yet the perception is that its still in a state of war
8825279 a lot of the problems the u s economy is having you simply do not have that in africa
8825280 people are starting to see africa much more as the land of opportunity than in the traditional paradigm of starvation and famine and war
8825281 there are opportunities in a number of countries its not universal but its there

8825283 us citizens were in the area in conflict during the hostilities in georgia it should be admitted that they would do so only in following direct orders from their leaders someone in the us specially created this conflict to create an advantage for a us presidential candidate
8825284 we are taking appropriate measures to ensure that russias potential for nuclear deterrence is in no way devalued the anti missile sites in poland and the czech republic could be selected as targets for our missiles
8825285 we conducted a test of a new ballistic missile with multiple warheads our actions are aimed at maintaining a balance in the world order
8825286 today our country is facing a surge of slander from those who dont like russias historical choice thus we must pray that peace be restored between the georgians and the ossetians here
8825287 i am aware of the appeal made by patriarch iliya of all georgia the russian church is ready to unite efforts with the georgian church in achieving peace let us then sit at the negotiation table for talks with respect for the traditions views and aspirations of both the georgian and ossetian peoples

8825290 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8825291 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8825292 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8825293 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8825294 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8825295 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8825296 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation
8825297 the 5 hole cbj news and notes 8 26 08
8825298 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see
8825299 id like to win the game for one the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there
8825300 i would love to get with those young guys and help them win because i know they are right at the next step of getting to the super bowl
8825301 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level

8825319 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8825320 some of the lads had gone to a charity shop before the game and had bought a load of ladies wedding hats then turned up to the game with them on it was a good laugh
8825321 one of the fans also has a russia air force helmet that he bought in lithuania before the scotland game and once had it rigged up to some beer on his back
8825322 hes not got the beer anymore but still has the hat
8825323 im not sure what to expect next im dreading it
8825324 maybe its something the supporters club are doing for the away games but it might start a trend
8825325 we know what harry needs and what he has been asking for to try and strengthen his squad and we are hoping to get a couple more players that would do just that
8825326 harry knows what our budget is but if we have to go that wee bit extra then we would
8825327 there is a point when we would have to stop in the budget and when you reach that point people will have to drop off to bring others in
8825328 that is the model we worked on in the east of scotland league and we need to work to those same principals in the third division albeit at a higher level
8825329 you cant start going down the road of getting into debt
8825330 weve had them watched and theyve got a lot of young and fit guys in their team

8825333 they are just monitoring her and she needs full rest and that is the opportunity they are giving her
8825334 ive spoken to her and shes in good spirits but she has to rest
8825335 the course lecturer told me that a lot of them had polish girlfriends
8825336 its a very challenging language to learn and the grammar is more difficult than german so youd have to be quite motivated to learn it although it might help having a girlfriend to practise with
8825337 i had been looking out for polish classes for years and was so excited when i saw the course
8825338 it was big sometimes you go to these classes and you only get a few people but there were about 18 people at the start of the polish classes and that went down to about a dozen by the end
8825339 there were lots and lots of men with polish girlfriends they had an unfair advantage as theyd go home and practise with them and come back improved the next week it was at least half the class
8825340 i think a lot of them will be back this year
8825341 there was even a guy there who had a lot of polish people as his customers in work and he wanted to learn some of their language
8825342 you hear about polish people learning english so its a bit different doing it the other way round
8825343 even just to say hello to a polish person in their language would be good we had some polish visitors to our class and they were really impressed we were learning it
8825344 i suppose its like going to a far away land and seeing people learning welsh
8825345 and i know that on thursday night at the stadium ill cry again
8825346 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap
8825347 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
8825348 in this back to school season college kids are buying macs in numbers never seen before a recent survey by student monitor a new jersey outfit that tracks the buying habits of college students found that 13 of all undergrads expect to buy a new notebook this fall of those 43 say they plan to get a macbook or macbook pro nearly double those who said they expected to get a dell notebook and seven times as many as those who plan to buy from hp says eric weil the firms managing partner while students prefer dell for desktop computers thats small consolation students favor notebooks over desktops by a factor of nearly 5 to 1
8825349 back to school time has always been important for apple in 2007 the company sold nearly 2 2 million macs in its fourth quarter ended sept 30 up 34 from the year earlier period those computers brought in 3 1 billion during the 2007 quarter half of all the companys revenue
8825350 another blowout quarter is in the offing analyst gene munster of piper jaffray pjc wrote in a research note on aug 25 that the latest numbers from market researcher npd suggest apple could sell as many as 2 9 million macs this quarter that would mean a surge of 34 from the same quarter a year ago on the ipod and iphone front npd data munster says suggest sales in the ballpark of 11 million and 4 million units respectively add it all up and you have the makings of a quarter where apple could beat wall street consensus numbers by 8 and report earnings per share as high as 1 19
8825351 moreover apple has of late been defying trends in the computer industry it has been winning share of the personal computer market reaching 8 5 in the u s behind dell and hp according to the most recent gartner it report in the second quarter it saw its year on year growth rate in unit shipments hit 38 thats three times the rate of growth at dell seven times faster than hp and nine times faster than the pc industry as a whole
8825352 students want to buy products that are cool and the perception about windows at the moment is anything but the ipod tends to entice people from windows over to the mac and the iphone will only add to that trend
8825353 next thing you know theyll be voting outside the 2 party system
8825354 hopefully not this election barack obama cant win without them
8825355 it just developed into a 2 7 million square foot facility
8825356 we need to call on people with wisdom and background like meg whitman
8825357 damp will be the weather yet hot the pyre in my backyard
8825358 so why not read the books and talk about them too
8825359 i was going for faster faster faster but something in me was rejecting that
8825360 it wasnt clear that the world needed faster faster faster so i began thinking about the opposite working on the fastest machine in the world got me thinking about the slowest
8825361 its the only 10 000 year forward thing i know of
8825362 in my little back of the napkin sketch i drew a picture showing a clock with concentric walls around it
8825363 i proposed that you could have a system of gates where it was open for a while at a certain time of year or decade or whatever when you could go in and out freely but if you were inside it when the gate closed youd be making a commitment to stay in until it opened again and i talked about clock monks who would tend the clock i put that idea in cold storage because i was working on the baroque cycle when i recovered i decided what the hell im just going to try writing this
8825364 youve got manuscripts that are relatively short and then youve got manuscripts that are taller than they are wide and then youve got ones that are taller than they are long
8825365 i was thinking shorter but once youve done all the work to build the project and get the reader into it theres the temptation to keep it going
8825366 their way of glorifying and expressing respect for ideas and thinkers that are important to them
8825367 i could never get that idea the notion that society in general is becoming aliterate out of my head
8825368 people who write books people who work in universities who work on big projects for a long time are on a diverging course from the rest of society slowly the two cultures just get further and further apart
8825369 one of the more interesting things about the project has been what anybody adds to it
8825370 clearly neals imagination is extraordinary he creates a whole world in his mind hes got every building imagined in more detail than its described in the book
8825371 were not planning on locking up people for thousands of years
8825372 i played the role of mephistopheles in christopher marlowes doctor faustus and on the technical side made a full size mechanical kong hand that at one point in the play reaches through a window and drags somebody offstage
8825373 we heard that tom clancy had made something like 17 million the previous year and thought if we could snag 1 percent of that wed still be ok
8825374 i was sort of going for broke with snow crash
8825375 i had tried to write stuff that was more conventional and that would be appealing to a large audience and it didnt work i figured i would just go for broke write something really weird and not be so worried about whether it was a good career move or not
8825376 in neals books hes been fantastically good at creating scenarios and technologies that are purely imaginary
8825377 its an insanely ambitious project it is a total folly
8825378 it presents itself as rational but thats like presenting the pyramids as rational
8825379 if i had to do a book tour every day it would kill me but four weeks every four years isnt too much to ask
8825380 its a pseudo liturgical use of mathematics and higher thinking
8825381 its really about the difference between people who can sit down and focus their attention for a long period of time on something complicated in a patient and steady way versus people who never read anything longer than a sentence or paragraph and who get very impatient if you try to go on at any length
8825382 when im working on a book i need to be uninterrupted a long attention span kind of thing on the other hand there are a lot of things in my life that are important and keep me communicating over email its harder for me even to read books than it used to be and theres an obvious irony there
8825383 sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me
8825384 im rubber youre glue it bounces off me and sticks to you
8825385 who do you trust more on national security a nominee for president who is willing to sit down with dictators without pre conditions or a nominee for president that wants to protect this country from our nations enemies
8825386 mccain is just like bush he voted with him 90 of the time followed by narrator saying
8825387 if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under
8825388 wenn die leute ber etwas nicht genau bescheid wissen neigen sie dazu die unbekannten punkte mit den eigenen erwartungen auszuf llen
8825389 all of you said hed never make it this far
8825390 you can no longer say that blacks cant accomplish anything now we can accomplish everything
8825391 75 000 people were there lets see how many people show up for the republican convention
8825392 im listening to c span now and all i hear is unrealistic people who have never known a difficult day in their life its funny how people can talk about how we cant accomplish when we dont get the same chances
8825393 listen lad ive built this kingdom up from nothing when i started here all there was was swamp all the kings said i was daft to build a castle in a swamp but i built it all the same just to show em it sank into the swamp so i built a second one that sank into the swamp so i built a third one that burned down fell over then sank into the swamp but the fourth one stayed up an thats what your gonna get lad the strongest castle in these islands
8825394 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8825395 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8825396 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8825397 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8825398 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8825399 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8825400 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8825401 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8825402 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8825403 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8825404 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8825405 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8825406 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8825407 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8825408 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8825409 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8825410 failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington
8825411 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8825412 ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors
8825413 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8825414 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8825415 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
8825416 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
8825417 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
8825418 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
8825419 standing up with courage and clear purpose they somehow managed to change the world
8825420 le jour o tu chevaucheras seul le cheval de tes opinions sur les terres arides de la pens e tu auras gagn mon respect
8825421 we are basically targeting the small investors and we are confident that we will be able to guide them in the best possible manner
8825422 we want to be a revelation to them since this business here is still in its infancy
8825423 we consciously wanted a family entertainer after an anger driven cop story
8825424 who can get elected so the corporations can continue uninterrupted the rape of america
8825425 le jour o tu chevaucheras seul le cheval de tes opinions sur les terres arides de la pens e tu auras gagn mon respect
8825426 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8825427 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we cannot turn back
8825428 amazing wonders of the world kingdom of the west yellowstone yosemite amp glacier national parks

8825431 attempting to solve a dispute physically sends the wrong message to a child like george
8825432 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8825433 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8825434 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8825435 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8825436 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8825437 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8825438 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent
8825439 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for
8825440 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8825445 so i am going out taking it serious and leaving no doubt that i belong here and trying to make it a tough decision for them that is my goal for this game go out and make plays and be productive and make no mistakes

8825450 you could talk to the next ten fight gamers you meet and not get the same kind of unapologetic depth that you get when you get an eddie goldman
8825451 if you want to know about boxing mma and all combat sports this is the place to be and its the only place to be
8825452 first of all you appreciate how hard theyve worked all of them
8825453 you know how important it is to them the dreams of the guys so its absolutely important that we are fair and honest with them and hope we make the right decision its very difficult theyre all good guys and theyve worked very hard for this but we have to do this we have to get down to 53

8825456 sustainable base camp where the citys urban edge meets untamed coastal wildlands
8825457 how are you going to get things done if you spend so much time planning to get things done
8825458 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8825459 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8825460 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8825461 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8825462 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8825463 there has to be another way to make it wear off
8825464 do not get george any more involved than he already is
8825465 he seems to have lost some of his self confidence without fred there to help
8825466 harry if you call my brother im cutting you off for a month
8825467 why would submitting to you make the prank handcuffs disappear
8825468 fine its a potion hes calling s amp mmm and he asked me to try it out
8825469 if you wanted to tie me up you couldve just asked
8825470 i might have though i do enjoy seeing you tied up more than i like being tied up
8825471 its not the first time you were a test subject and wont be the last
8825472 i dont want to be my brothers test subject any more
8825473 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8825474 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8825475 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it

8825477 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office

8825487 mentors of young scientists need to exhibit the highest standard of ethical behaviour and collegiality
8825488 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8825489 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8825490 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8825491 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8825492 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8825493 she was using language to get at what she wanted she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8825494 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa

8825496 conventional coffee cups are made from ceramic compositions which do not absorb microwaves and hence they do not heat up when conventional ceramics are used for heating food only food heats up and then the hot food heats up the ceramic
8825497 the microwaves heat up the container and hence the food rice cooks in about half or less time

8825499 ha sido muy frustrante porque s que puedo jugar mucho mejor cre muchas opciones de ganar durante el partido y me siento frustrada por haberlas perdido pero quiero ser positiva porque hoy ya no he sentido molestias por la lesi n y eso me motiva mucho para salir pronto a la cancha y seguir mejorando
8825500 nunca antes la hab a visto jugar y no sab a que esperar ella ha servido muy bien y muy fuerte y aunque me esforc no tuve opci n comet muchos errores en el partido y fue por falta de pr ctica ya que ltimamente he hechos muchos viajes
8825501 people had a whole range of views on what the population impacts were what the impacts were on employment and so forth and these seemed to be really influential on the way that people were thinking about plantations
8825502 we have traced the hard drive and are currently retrieving it the purchaser is co operating with charnwood and has stated that the data has not been distributed to any other parties
8825503 we can confirm that an individual has been arrested and is assisting the police with their inquiries
8825504 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8825505 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter
8825506 you keep mourning a life interrupted you need to understand that your daughter lived a life completed
8825507 when you do open up your institution and create this participatory approach the benefits to your donor base your membership and your mission are far more sustaining its a metric that creates longevity
8825508 our goal is to inspire new ways of thinking not just reward the team that wins as a 501 3 our mission includes both education and civic engagement
8825509 there has been an awful lot of ingrained behavior that has made us look at solving problems over a very large time span s 10 20 30 years this will change its a movement that is not going to slow down its going to accelerate

8825512 i think every commuters worst fear is to know were so vulnerable its pretty shocking its sad its scary
8825513 heres a guy thats riding down the road hes doing everything he can hes wearing bright clothing hes wearing a helmet hes way over on a wide shoulder and he still gets hit there was no reason for it he was so far over on the shoulder a five foot section of pavement he was almost in the grass the sun was behind him so he wasnt blinded
8825514 he built his own bicycle and he inspired others around him to commute by bike
8825515 he also helped us with the headwaters trail as a blm staffer
8825516 we as a community can do better to work with law enforcement transportation planners and motorists
8825517 across the country theres really a movement toward affecting behavior toward making motorists aware of bicyclists and pedestrians and making cyclists and pedestrians more aware too its about creating a culture that supports bicycling and walking where its respected and honored
8825518 you cant get everywhere you need to go as a commuter on a bicycle trail even if there are trails everywhere
8825519 and there are many people in our community that dont have an option to walk or bike we have a lot of car less folks because of the economic conditions and so theres a screaming need for planners and for engineers and safety officers and the das office all to be at the same table looking at the safety of non motorists how they plan how they educate the public how they press charges when collisions happen all of those things are of a piece and they all need to be working together to create safe passage
8825520 but thats expensive and we need help from the entities whose responsibility is to protect cyclists or pedestrians or to educate motorists
8825521 tabloids elections and democracy tabloid coverage of a national election
8825522 we sought to establish whether this medium with its wide reach and potential to influence voters provided information and framed election issues in such a way that voters were equipped to vote wisely in the 2007 elections
8825523 yes when they are financially secure and stable as in the case of bulgar and if in the case of all three there is recognition of their responsibility to educate voters about candidates and issues during elections
8825524 when tabloids are on survival mode and need to maintain political and personal relations to survive then its a no
8825525 our research focuses on the constructions of frames and not on how frames influence audiences
8825526 we looked at organizational pressure ideology attitude etc and the resulting frames that emerged we acknowledged the links between the inputs and the frames but it was beyond the scope of this study to determine the process how inputs influence the choice of frames
8825527 for editors friendship made it difficult to turn down requests for exposure these connections also facilitated access to breaking news stories
8825528 the opposition was the most covered political actor tabloid stories including those related to the election were written using street language for better rapport with readers
8825529 this conscious attempt to inform or caution readers indicated how abante reporters regarded their audience as voters or participants in a democratic exercise
8825530 favored no political party favoring neither the administration nor the opposition institutional values economics and political orientation were three major factors that affected the way its stories were framed
8825531 bulgar prides itself for being a tabloid whose news room is clean having turned away politicians and candidates who offered bribes in exchange for coverage
8825532 as the editor in chief explained they need to hook readers first before they can be educated it is bulgars commercial success that actually allowed it to maintain a non partisan stance in its election coverage
8825533 in reporting election related events tabloid editors and reporters alike regard their audience as voters who deserve and need information to make intelligent choices
8825534 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country
8825535 hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button
8825536 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
8825537 the history here thats not too impressive of a record
8825538 hopefully we can add on to that a little bit more
8825539 certainly not the way we drew it up the thing thats really painful for me and the staff is you want to give people a reason to believe
8825540 i feel like we let a lot of people down
8825541 i was proud of them it would have been easy to come here and not be ready to play
8825542 i dont know if ive ever been this nervous about an opening game weve always played well as the underdog but i was really concerned about having that top 25 ranking coming in here
8825543 kirbys been through some ups and downs we felt like he deserved the opportunity and we gave it to him
8825544 i thought griffin provided a spark which is what he has to do for us
8825545 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8825546 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8825547 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8825548 you dont ever want to get swept especially in the situation were in
8825549 we had to really fight to win that last one
8825550 weve been stale we havent been able to get the big hit we havent been able to make a big pitch
8825551 our freedom will only be complete if those who violated our rights like the pnp philippine national police will be held responsible
8825552 information for rebellion against the accused is dismissed the accused are hereby ordered released from custody immediately
8825553 the rebellion case against the tagaytay 5 should have been dismissed as early as november 26 had the department of justice through the office of the city prosecutor of tagaytay city not persisted in its legal bamboozling and hoodwink tactics by using the non criminal act of subversion to prove the criminal charge of rebellion to prolong our unlawful detention so as to convict unarmed militants
8825554 we need the aquifer studies and long term monitoring in place first so the treasure valley doesnt become the next atlanta which over allocated and is now suffering the economic consequences
8825555 they will discuss some settlements and ways to expedite the process
8825556 the water rights approval could be in stages it could be reduced it could be pending the state study
8825557 for a water right of this magnitude the only option that makes sense is phasing
8825558 we need the aquifer studies and long term monitoring in place first so the treasure valley doesnt become the next atlanta which over allocated and is now suffering the economic consequences
8825559 they will discuss some settlements and ways to expedite the process
8825560 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8825561 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8825562 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8825563 i made a couple of mistake pitches and they hit them over the fence
8825564 im really proud of the fact that weve really raised the level of our intensity despite only having 12 000 people in the stands
8825565 theyve been very professional about this thats the part i really appreciate about it also youd like to see 36 000 every night but for right now the way our guys are going about our business im very proud of them
8825566 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
8825567 the food bank has refined its focus by not just bringing food in but bringing in nourishing food
8825568 the food is rotated out of grocery stores because the consumer has a certain expectation when shopping and the grocery stores do everything possible to keep that display attractive
8825569 its a clear explanation why we have such a serious problem of obesity with low income folks
8825570 you go for the quick fix that cost less but you put on fat
8825571 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8825572 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8825573 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8825574 i woke up this morning and i went to google and i googled the entire martin luther king speech because like most americans i you know you listen to the i have a dream part in the earlier part of the speech he talks about the promise of democracy and i think that today that promise was fulfilled in a way that i never imagined in my lifetime
8825575 and what i saw with barack obama was something that was transcendent and i felt transformational for me as a human being and for this country and i only pray in the deepest part of my being that america will rise to this moment and i feel that what he was able to offer us as individual citizens and as a united country was something that we have never seen before i really i think its the most powerful thing ive ever experienced
8825576 i dont know what kind of lives mccain thinks celebrities lead
8825577 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8825578 he mobilized the english language and sent it into battle
8825579 but do you think it will appeal to the small business owner
8825580 yes barack grew up with a single mom after his dad left very similar to how mccain left is first wife and kids
8825581 government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
8825582 it covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated rules minute and uniform through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate to rise above the crowd the will of man is not shattered but softened bent and guided men are seldom forced by it to act but they are constantly restrained from acting such a power does not destroy but it prevents existence it does not tyrannize but it compresses enervates extinguishes and stupefies a people till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals of which the government is the shepherd
8825583 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support barack obama for the leader of the free world
8825584 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
8825585 avita medical has undergone a major transformation following the merger of clinical cell culture and visiomed group with implementation of significant changes in organisational structure and focus

8825591 because youre standing close to me im coming down with something feverishly
8825592 what the fuck is the deal with that n w a techno song

8825595 die immer noch anhaltende teuerungswelle wird allerorts diskutiert was die teilweise drastisch gestiegenen preise bedeuten versteht wohl niemand so gut wie die fast 200 000 akut armen oder von armut gef hrdeten kinder und jugendlichen wenn sie mit ihren eltern stifte hefte oder schultaschen kaufen m chten
8825596 die anschaffung aller n tigen schulmaterialien f r einen taferlklassler bel uft sich in sterreich laut einer aktuellen studie der arbeiterkammer auf rund 100 euro ein betrag der bei vielen m ttern und v tern f r verzweiflung sorgt wenn benachteiligte familien schon schwierigkeiten haben im winter ihre wohnung heizen oder ausreichend lebensmittel kaufen zu k nnen haben so manche m dchen und buben im gegensatz zu ihren gl cklicheren klassenkameraden das nachsehen
8825597 armut ist nicht nur ein thema von gestern es ist auch nicht nur ein thema anderer l nder armut gibt es auch in sterreich und der unterschied zwischen arm und reich wird eher gr er als kleiner dagegen m ssen wir gemeinsam etwas tun vor allem kindern m ssen wir die reale chance zu mehr bildung und qualifikation geben das ist die wirksamste m glichkeit um aus dem teufelskreis armut auszubrechen
8825598 we are pleased with the positive result which has been achieved in the face of some challenging conditions in the industry
8825599 the 2008 result was driven by a strong contribution from our feedstock business and we expect substantial further growth to come from this business in the current financial year as planting and exports of seeds are increased substantially
8825600 in addition we expect a greater contribution to come from our refinery business when construction of our second 250 000 tpa biodiesel plant is completed and output increased
8825601 with a positive outlook for each of our business divisions we are forecasting revenue and earnings to grow significantly in the 2009 financial year

8825606 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell
8825607 it didnt actually get brought to my attention that that was going to be a labor website
8825608 there are some elements of every campaign that could have been done better or not done at all and that was one of them
8825609 the people of wa want their politicians to be talking about the issues that matter not peripheral muckraking type stuff
8825610 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8825611 these changes are necessary to address the challenges confronting b amp b power going forward
8825612 it seemed to me that the clintons did what they needed to do
8825613 but it does also seem like the last two days were more about them than him
8825614 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8825615 they were able to make obama more acceptable and to restore some measure of party unity but they never defined john mccain in terms that will help them in the fall
8825616 i think mccain was able to thanks to the clintons successfully not be the pinata this week
8825617 sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear well not this year not this time

8825626 the battered financial sector found some traction today climbing two per cent as traders covered their short positions pushing macquarie bank up over four per cent
8825627 i have known the asknet team for many years and i am looking forward to be working for a technology leader in a market with a very promising future

8825629 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8825630 this is early in the year and it doesnt concern me if she isnt getting pushed too much
8825631 i am just hoping she has something left in the tank for november and december i am hoping she goes out there and gets a good training run but you never know there might be a freshman runner we might no know about
8825632 ive been here for 10 of these and the top schools will be memorial and college park
8825633 they were second and third at the region meet and we should have a pretty competitive meet i thought lauren got pushed last week more than i thought she would but both memorial and college park werent there foster was and they were the only school we ran against that is coming this week
8825634 for the varsity boys jakob baumeister lupe mata and jose salinas are my senior runners and will pretty much be running each week for us
8825635 jakob pretty much solidified a spot on the varsity in the last two weeks and with lupe and jose it is a week by week thing to see how they run
8825636 it is an early test for us but we are basically a young team with one senior for both boys and girls
8825637 luis chavez is the only senior with experience and we are trying to rebuild up within
8825638 we are going to try to go in and just try to be competitive
8825639 the deaf are hearing and the mute are now speaking
8825640 man i tell you all what i thought we had one there
8825641 that type of running is responsibility football and they hurt us with the dive
8825642 we said we were going to take the quarterback away from them and except for one big run in that first series we did that i thought if wed stop him wed win the game but they got after us
8825643 we had three different times to do something with the ball and we missed out three big plays and all three times we had a penalty
8825644 i am so proud of the fight the tenacity it was just a dogfight the whole game and in that fourth quarter it just turned into one of those back and forth deals
8825645 we just came in at the short end of the stick there at the end
8825646 we are all relieved to be back as oneill would say there is no place that is like home jack could not have been more horrified if the jaffa had just announced his intentions to marry apophis
8825647 the rules were that we drink when we could picture you doing something we never said youd actually had to do it
8825648 see its the hair that made it easy to picture young indy has the same hair as young daniel
8825649 thanks tealc uh i um have great affection for you too
8825650 i love you youre the best astro astoron assphysi genius star science doctor ive ever had
8825651 dont be ridiculous im not a genius star science doctor how could i be jealous
8825652 daniel jackson i believe it is time we returned major carter to her residence are you ready to leave or should i call a cab
8825653 no ill stay for awhile why dont you take my car ill just take jacks truck later its not like hell be using it
8825654 i dont want you to think im taking advantage of you
8825655 but you have to i could have alcohol poisoning you need to be close to keep an eye i me
8825656 stop trying to give me an out i said it i meant it believe it deal with it
8825657 ah ah ah jack ive been waiting for this a long time no need to rush now weve all day
8825658 according to the scientific method the hypothesis isnt valid until the experiment has been preformed many times with the same results
8825659 good looks can open doors but great hair blows them off the hinges
8825660 a president who wont spy on america respect a womans right to choose shuts down guantanamo and stops torture
8825661 george bush and john mccain have done nothing for people like me
8825662 i am a lifelong rep who voted for nixon reagan and bush and bush but i cant afford four more years like this
8825663 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8825664 barack obama i thought who names their kid barack obama
8825665 it presents a concept of a hero as one who will not kill unless its unavoidable
8825666 also because of the total vision of the piece as laid out by director and co writer and ingenious use of chicago as gotham city
8825667 while we expected it to be big we never thought it would turn into the juggernaut it has and it can probably be attributed to a perfect storm of factors all lining up into place
8825668 its definitely more of a guy comedy which is why it probably wont gross as much
8825669 because i dont want you guys to think youre going to go through this without getting yourself really twisted its brutal what happens to us not many of us make it
8825670 the m13 viruses used by the team cant reproduce by themselves and are only capable of infecting bacteria at just 880 nanometers long 500 times smaller than a grain of salt the bugs allow researchers to work at room temperatures and pressures with molecular precision using and wasting fewer hazardous materials in the process now that theyve demonstrated the construction of such tiny electronic components is possible the challenge facing researchers is how to make them practical
8825671 a much buzzed about paper published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences earlier this month details the teams success in creating two of the three parts of a working battery the positively charged anode and the electrolyte
8825672 i hope we dont have any outstanding noise violations against us
8825673 weve had our sound called jam rock reggae funk which i think is pretty accurate
8825674 im still learning every day thats the beauty of music
8825675 im influenced by a lot of jam bands and improvisations as you can hear in our shows
8825676 its always a strategy to get the school market and the easiest way is to be on campuses
8825677 then my father gave me sen obamas biography to read and i found out that he is really somebody that i can relate to
8825678 no 1 it gives you national recognition no 2 not too many resorts are four star across texas and were really pleased we are one of those from time to time golf digest does these special editions and somebody could read this and decide by that to come here and play all the members here are excited were honored
8825679 its a combination of a lot of work from a lot of people
8825680 its a great recognition for the course and also for the entire area i hope we get some more golfers down here to see a jewel thats in the backyard of this community
8825681 theyve always had good skilled players and this year have a new coach in michael oguin
8825682 ive been here since 1989 and it was way before that when these teams started playing i believe it started when sweeny dropped from 4a to 3a in the early 80s a lot of it has to do with the family connection between both communities
8825683 i think sweeny has a lot more tradition than what we have at van vleck
8825684 it is a big rivalry with some close games along the way our kids are excited and they are focused
8825685 i think we are pretty healthy and excited about the season but we are coming off a year where we didnt reach some goals
8825686 we have five non district games and a lot of young kids
8825687 we need to see where we are conditioning wise and how some of these young kids can handle friday nights
8825688 we need to keep them calm and playing within themselves we also need them to have some fun because this is what this is all about in the first place
8825689 it is a lot different moving from one seat to the other
8825690 a lot more demands on my time but i am trying to relax and delegate as best as possible i am excited and dreamed about this two or three months ago
8825691 there is a lot of energy on this team but i expect them to play together as a team on friday night
8825692 but i also expect those guys to be football players and students at the same time
8825693 the bulldogs are going to be hard to stop because they do have a good quarterback and a good transfer running back
8825694 i cant say we are going to stop them but i like our chances
8825695 if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8825696 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8825697 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8825698 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
8825699 there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
8825700 it is a source of profound disappointment to us to witness the council rendered incapable of discharging its responsibility to maintain international peace and security
8825701 i think there is more in store with the events university board has planned
8825702 i think ub has some really good programs in the book
8825703 realistically i would like beyonce to come here but its not going to happen
8825704 at bars people come in for the atmosphere but when a band is performing dont really pay attention
8825705 when you cut the budget in half you arent really left with much choice than to cut half your sites
8825706 initially we wanted to bring in professional artists to really put in some high end artwork but we simply did not have enough resources for that
8825707 the form of the sculpture is meant to be an amalgam of many different forms
8825708 its meant to kind of resemble the architecture in the area
8825709 it can also be an intimidating fortification or watch tower
8825710 its meant to stick out on campus in that it has a cobbled together appearance
8825711 as if someone had gathered those materials and built this shelter to be protected from being seen
8825712 it looks like someone has made a definite attempt to protect themselves
8825713 the complex angles gave the form a dynamic feel and i wanted to exaggerate that notion by adding the sweeping lines which penetrate into the air
8825714 im excited about the things i create and want to share them with a wider audience and beautify the campus at eiu
8825715 i really wanted to challenge myself to execute a drastically difficult masterpiece within a very limited time period
8825716 the balance in the piece by the cantilever action between the upper and lower fabricated welded and painted steel elements speaks to the balance that the college student in particular and everyone needs to find in their own life to be successful
8825717 i hope to inspire people to think with this piece drive them towards excellence and balance in their life
8825718 these are people who have a commitment to being in sculpture
8825719 these are people who have shown that this is the direction they want to pursue as a profession but theyre getting their academic credentials
8825720 i would like to see this be something that eastern is known for
8825721 we cut the number of links on the homepage in half
8825722 we wanted to update the look make it more modern and reflect eiu
8825723 basically what i started out doing was mock up a page in photoshop
8825724 i looked on there a lot to see what other people are doing
8825725 we wanted to keep the background neutral but still eastern
8825726 on the general we havent got any negative feedback or that they hate the site
8825727 the first representative of the european community who saw everything with his own eyes
8825728 however hard i tried to persuade him to acknowledge the genocide he didnt agree saying that a difficult political discussion in europe lies ahead and he will report everything what he saw
8825729 im zweiten quartal 2008 kam die erfolgreiche umsetzung unserer diversifikationsstrategie zum ausdruck unsere positionen im russischen und kasachischen markt sind erneut gewachsen dank zunehmender sidetrack drilling aktivit ten und der optimierung der kapazit tsauslastung sind wir bestens f r kommende herausforderungen des marktes sowie f r nachhaltig starkes wachstum ger stet

8825732 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8825733 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8825734 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8825735 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8825736 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8825737 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8825738 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8825739 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8825740 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8825741 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8825742 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8825743 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8825744 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8825745 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8825746 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

8825750 no we are doing a musical calledonce upon a matrress
8825751 this aggression the peed on rug will not stand man
8825752 walter i love you but one of these days we are going to have to face the fact that youre an idiot
8825753 hey man this case has its ups and downs and its what have yous
8825754 this one went to market this ones optimistic this one just came out of the swamp
8825755 bring down the government they dont they dont speak for us
8825756 we may not agree on abortion but clearly we can agree that we want to reduce unwanted pregnancies in this country
8825757 tofu is a wholesome complete vegetable protein that is very easy to digest this makes it a good food for babies children and the elderly it is an excellent food for sensitive stomachs and a perfect protein food for those with heart disease because it has no cholesterol those who are allergic to milk or eggs or those who follow strict dietary laws prohibiting dairy products find that tofu adds great variety to their menus
8825758 children will delight in pointing out macdonalds blunders and laugh aloud at his antics
8825759 we just grew into that and let kids jump up and we became a lot closer of a team
8825760 finishing the season strong led into good spring ball practices which led to good offseason workouts which led to a good start to our fall camp all in all i think it was just one thing building on another
8825761 theyre playing aggressive coach bo pelini has done a great job getting them ready theyre going to have a new mentality and theyre going to be excited
8825762 we spent a lot of time in fall practice working on our blocking technique
8825763 thats really big for us because thats all we got
8825764 we dont get receiving yards or rushing yards the only yards we get to look at is how many the back gets the only stat you really get besides that is holding calls and offsides we would like to keep our numbers up in an area that we wont get in trouble for
8825765 we spent a lot of time in fall practice working on our blocking technique we want to be a physical team that will get knockdowns and one of the best places to do it is on the perimeter
8825766 everybody has an individual man to pick up and i think thats great because everyone is responsible for that one man and theres no excuses you cant just let one man bust the wedge thats your man and you have to take him on
8825767 because if you need two gos to get it to that stage well i think my kids could come up with a better design than that in one afternoon
8825768 you cant bring the ryder cup on to greens like this
8825769 they have a bit of rain and the best professionals in europe cant hit the hole from two feet
8825770 they could rip them up and redo them thats my fear for the ryder cup coming here that theyre just going to keep patching them up over the years hopefully they redo them
8825771 you build a course between two valleys in scotland and you have to expect rain so rain is not an excuse for having bad greens this week im afraid ive put down a green at home which is like concrete and weve had almost as much rain as theyve had here

8825773 theres been an awful lot of rain and the greens are soft i was practising here last week and they had to close the range a couple of times because of the rain the weather has been awful and the greens have suffered i think some greens drain better than these theres no doubt about that so well have to look into that in the future
8825774 i hope they dont use the designer who has had two gos at doing the seventh green

8825795 in my mind it would be an incredible coincidence to rename the honors program after the cfo of microsoft at the same time were going with their e mail
8825796 i know about balancing budgets as governor i balanced the budget every year during some difficult times
8825797 i can tell you joe biden gets it hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
8825798 we are here to be your voice no problem is too small
8825799 you cant worry about what other people are doing you just keep working keep grinding and have faith that in the end everything will happen the way you want it to happen
8825800 i think that nebraskans as a people are very concerned about our neighbors we see a need and we want to help fill the void
8825801 unl made a mistake kicking two very talented wrestlers off the wrestling team and i highly doubt any man on the team much less any man in america has never been naked before or god forbid jerked off before
8825802 the real purpose of political conventions is to give presidential candidates a chance to hit the reset button

8825809 it is good to get the team together bonding experience to travel right out of the gate and put everybody in an unfamiliar territory not being at home and comfortable the girls tend to cling to each other which is a great way to start the season off
8825810 when dealing with an all star team you usually have very talented individuals but you just arent sure what their chemistry is going to be like and how they are going to work together
8825811 we know we are going to make mistakes but we have discussed looking beyond those and working through those
8825812 we are preparing ourselves for bad bounces bad passes and missed tackles and that type of stuff that is going to occur in the first game of the season
8825813 i am so excited but still a little nervous with all the new people
8825814 you can never be sure if they are 100 percent ready and they never really are until they get that first game out of the way the freshman and the walk ons that we have this year are doing fantastic so far and i am excited to see the light bulb click this weekend

8825816 russert was recording voiceovers for sundays meet the press broadcast when he collapsed
8825817 tim russert was one of my closest friends and he was like a brother to me he was not only a professional confidant but a personal one he was always the first person to call me whenever anything happened with my family and he always called me just to check in and see how i was doing and to encourage me my heart goes out to his son luke his wife maureen his father sister and entire family they were his joy in life family and faith were everything to him he was one of a kind to me and i was lucky enough to have had him as a best friend
8825818 now you and grandpa will always be by my side
8825819 communication implies someone is going to pick up the phone or have voice mail and its not happening
8825820 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8825821 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8825822 this weeks meet is a pretty small one and the whole team isnt running
8825823 its for some of the new people to get their feet wet and really just run their first college race
8825824 kids you dont wanna be like me its safer to watch me on tv
8825825 you have to have a little bit more mentality of you cant take points off and have to be low error you make three or four errors in a row or get down its a shorter distance to be able to come back
8825826 i think youre going to see more four and five set matches
8825827 i worry that some of the matches the fans may not feel like they got much for their money
8825828 because its a 3 0 match maybe it goes pretty short thats the downside of it
8825829 if we cant serve and pass then were not going to win anything
8825830 its a dog race its just five points but its a huge difference
8825831 i think its important for us to go out compete and not worry about whos ranked higher we just need to focus on playing our game and not worry about anything else
8825832 we just want a lot of people to show up and have a good time
8825833 a lot of people come to the bull riding saturday night because thats a really
8825834 i dont really remember how i started playing the kazoo
8825835 but im sure one day i just was like fuck it im gonna go out and get a kazoo and play it because i can hum and im going to play the kazoo and it was a lot of fun because you can play anything you want
8825836 hearing a lot of music some of it really old some of it really new some of it from people you know some of it from people you dont know
8825837 its just hard to tell where the inspiration is actually coming from
8825838 his singing is very mature he sounds like the real deal like he really feels what hes saying
8825839 there are times when we have to do better than
8825840 there will be less traffic on 16th and 17th streets
8825841 when we have a major storm the channel will now handle it
8825842 ill admit ive always been about the whole sticking around
8825843 i lived in lincoln for six or seven years it became home
8825844 the reason i stayed around was because of family that lived in the state
8825845 just the social aspect of it is reason enough to stay
8825846 why did i pay an extra 300 for the convenience of parking closer to my dorm than everyone else
8825847 its money they students can spend any way they want
8825848 it goes directly to the student through an hourly part time job
8825849 i get to do my homework if im not busy and i get to know some of the professors and accountants who are around the building a lot better
8825850 at this time of the year thats about the average this time of the year is going to be busier than in the middle of the year
8825851 it will probably slow down as jobs are filled most employers wont need to hire come mid september
8825852 it was a good momentum booster for us we needed it
8825853 they were playing hard on the hitch so we said well go with the pump sure enough the safety flew and the pass was wide open
8825854 hes deceptively fast has great hands and runs good routes
8825855 hes a vertical threat from the tight end position which is very irregular
8825856 plays like that coach just tells us to rally to them
8825857 minimize the yardage obviously its tough to defend no matter what defense youre going to run but those types of plays you just have to rally to them and make tackles
8825858 i tried opening my own salon for a long time but couldnt find a place
8825859 a lot of high school girls like all the crazy colors
8825860 i was the only one doing coffee in charleston and now theres four others
8825861 they are going to be direct and they are going to be organized
8825862 they have a good coach and he has recruited a lot of good players the last couple of years
8825863 after the game against indianapolis we realized what we have to do
8825864 especially the younger guys showed in the intrasquad match the kind of effort we need
8825865 we have played them in previous years but every year is a new team
8825866 i picked up a knot in his leg awhile back but im feeling better now
8825867 we have to take our game to them we cant let them take their game to us start fast
8825868 if we play at our highest level we will be in good shape
8825869 its never easy to play a team in their home opener
8825870 purdue came in primed to get a win and were able to take advantage of the mistakes we made
8825871 whats a blackshirt mean if its just a symbol that you havent earned
8825872 we have to earn them as we have had to for every single year i dont fault him for setting that rule its not something that you just hand out its a level of play that you have to play at consistently
8825873 the increase we had serves a purpose in doudna but we are still understaffed from the level we were prior to the budget cuts
8825874 we are a lot more competitive in this pre season than last year
8825875 weve been doing numerous blocking and eye work in practice
8825876 we have to watch the ball and the setter without breaking concentration
8825877 most of the focus right now is what were doing on our side of the net
8825878 if we do what we can on offense we can play well if we do system were fine
8825879 i certainly appreciate the effort the team put forth saturday and dont doubt demarcus nelson was trying his damndest
8825880 but duke students dont sleep in the cold for two months just to see players give it their all expectations can and should be high and they were not fulfilled this year or last
8825881 i dont know about yall but i was under the impression that part of my birthright as a privileged duke student was a mens basketball national championship or at least a final four you really think i came here for the academics
8825882 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8825883 no one has ever requested any other type of chaser seems as though the water works quite well
8825884 its strictly an individual competition though support helps the more serious competitors
8825885 i dont know of anyone getting sick as a result of the competition
8825886 this isnt like the hot dog eating contests in that i dont know anyone that really takes time to prepare for it
8825887 ninety percent of the time they dont hit the bulls eye
8825888 its just that this is one of the only places in the united states to do it
8825889 people have good fun with it they have a good time doing it
8825890 i have a right to think that this trial is about vengeance
8825891 my physical disabilities do not allow me to confront this last combat
8825892 this cannot be dealt with outside the context of the war
8825893 the revenge of the montonero groups that now govern the country
8825894 the season never seems to come as soon as you want it and when it comes its almost too quick
8825895 weve done a lot of good work in august and were about as ready as were going to be everybodys excited weve put the work in now its game time
8825896 it really is a solid game a big test for us to start the season
8825897 el campo is always tough they have a great coaching staff and deep tradition those kids play well run to the ball and do everything youd want a team to do
8825898 you want to win every game that you come out and play thats always your no 1 goal
8825899 at the same time it is early on and were going to be evaluating all these positions to make sure we have the kids in the right spots
8825900 we want to play each position at a high level the entire game and sometimes one single player cant do that so well have some split time starters were going to see where everybody fits and do whats best to help us win
8825901 thatll be a big emotional lift for el campo and thats something well have to deal with
8825902 i remember when we did the same thing at hopper field a few years ago it definitely got the kids going and im sure the same thing will happen with el campo
8825903 we want to run the ball take some pressure off the quarterback and be strong on the line
8825904 were both hard nosed teams that are going to get physical and are going to run the football id expect nothing else
8825905 were going to have to be mistake free and limit our turnovers
8825906 the rockers have historically been the most courageous and honest musicians in cuba standing up to the castro regime and gorki aguila is the latest in that proud line
8825907 make no mistake about it the bands lyrics harshly criticize the castro dictatorship and that is the real reason aguila is being detained
8825908 aguilas arrest is a blatant case of musical censorship on the part of the regime and shows that nothing has really changed in cuba under raul castro since fidel disappeared from the public eye two years ago
8825909 we need to stand together and honor these men with the guts to do what the vast majority of musicians in my impoverished country havent done

8825912 wow check out fred hes all frozen thats so weird i want to be dead too i want to be dead like fred
8825913 but if i step in to lead it ill use my way which is not peaceful one
8825914 to reach our goal sometime it has to be painful so that it could go ahead its possible that it could be similar to the may 1992 bloodshed
8825915 we are not dispersing the crowd but we follow the courts order
8825916 and police did not use force on protesters because this is a sensitive matter
8825917 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8825918 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8825919 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8825920 for my graphic work i compile as much source material as possible in the form of textures random marks and scribbles etc and scan it all the primary image is drawn and also scanned
8825921 they found a way to make a few bucks fucking over the type of guys that fucked them over in the first place
8825922 i miss the little guy i just hope he remembers me
8825923 i would have no idea what would happen but it would definitely be interesting
8825924 i hope i am not literally going to be a fish out of water

8825926 the italian artists whom vasari admired are the same artists we admire today in nearly the same ranking and degree
8825927 all of a sudden i came across a big bag of marshmallows at a bodega and figured i could try using those
8825928 and of course the minute i set them up i said i want to paint marshmallows
8825929 seeing it come to fruition was a lot harder than i thought
8825930 first of all theres all of the white and then theres so many of them and they all have to feel like they are sitting on top of each other
8825931 they just looked like they should be painted something about it seemed clear and uncomplicated
8825932 i went into one place and asked for marshmallows and the lady said theyre in back but when i went to find them they were gone oh she said someone must have bought them all and i knew it was me
8825933 i would oppose any change in the law that a legislative body tries to make
8825934 i do think after youve asked the public to express their views twice you dont try to circumvent the will of the public
8825935 the city council has the right to change term limits if they want to
8825936 democracy has been given a chance and we should live with the results
8825937 thats what this multi billion dollar industry is about inner beauty
8825938 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died

8825972 the study just proved what weve known all along that employees make the difference in a companys success
8825973 the key ingredients for any incentive awards program are customers and employees its as simple as that with those two factors we can tailor a program for our customers our customers and their employees want to know whats in it for me this study helps us answer both of those questions our customers routinely achieve record high sales with more cash in their accounts while their employees have an added incentive to convince customers to buy more and pay their bills on time our successful customers know that our program is a necessary investment in the financial health of their companies

8825982 i believe that overall our defense will be better we have better speed than we did last year we have a little bit more depth at certain positions coach williams did an outstanding job preparing our linebacking corps and they played well they had a great opportunity to make plays and they made them
8825983 we ran the ball we passed it the defense played great

8825989 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8825990 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8825991 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8825992 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back

8825995 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8825996 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8825997 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8825998 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8825999 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8826000 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8826001 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8826002 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8826003 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8826004 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8826005 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8826006 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8826007 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8826008 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8826009 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8826010 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8826011 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8826012 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8826013 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8826014 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8826015 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8826016 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8826017 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8826018 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8826019 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8826020 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8826021 passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8826022 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8826023 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8826024 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8826025 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8826026 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
8826027 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8826028 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8826029 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8826030 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8826031 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8826032 i thought i hit the ball from the back of the court very well
8826033 he serves so well when you find it hard to break someone and theyre coming in all the time against you then it makes it tricky but i started to return well towards the end of the third set and i obviously broke him twice in the fourth that was the difference
8826034 it is best not to swat the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8826035 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8826036 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8826037 were switching our tax base out of the uk because it will save us a shed load of cash
8826038 well be domiciled in dublin before you can say wheres my tax return
8826039 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8826040 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8826041 bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8826042 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8826043 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8826044 in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8826045 weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go
8826046 but we must march again we must march like we have never marched before to elect the next president of the united states barack obama
8826047 we would not be denying the climate crisis we would be solving the climate crisis
8826048 put it this way those are three players opposing teams spend a lot of time trying to stop
8826049 weve got great players we might not have the depth we would have had but were going to be a team thats very talented which is going to play the game with a certain amount of confidence and skill and well be somebody other teams arent going to want to play
8826050 im thinking oh man obviously im not tough enough on these guys
8826051 we have players here and this is unique who are taking ownership of their games a lot of people put all of that on the coach and practices but if they dont feel like theyre getting enough passing reps in practice theyll come in at a different time
8826052 og det kan du ikke det er helt udelukket men vi tager os den tid der skal til og s ender det med at vi kommer bagud

8826081 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8826082 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8826083 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8826084 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8826085 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8826086 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
8826087 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
8826088 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8826089 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
8826090 now i just take a taxi home with my brothers they are both younger than me because if we do not do that then we know that we will be hit or insulted the problem is that there are groups of drunk young people and when they see that you are a foreigner or a stranger they start shouting bad words
8826091 although hastings is essentially a safe town with crime falling the fact remains that this has happened on this occasion
8826092 we need to recognise there are racist feelings among some members of our community and they are unacceptable
8826093 we miss you already we cannot explain how we feel but god knows

8826102 it wasnt the penalty it was the 60 second delay before the flag was thrown
8826103 but what a game football fans had to appreciate the talent on that field some of the coaching was questionable but the talent wow
8826104 its special when you can bring together two communities celebrate a rivalry and enjoy a world class movie
8826105 my mom actually went on the ud web site when i was being recruited and said james do you notice theres no black people there i told her god wanted me to go there and its been a great situation
8826106 i love getting to know people and being exposed to other cultures its been a blessing i wouldnt change my decision im in a very privileged position because of that
8826107 sheffield is more quiet in the gym we have more conversations about things that need to be fixed
8826108 horsmon was more in your face loud and intense its more laid back now but we get a lot done its very productive
8826109 this was a team that played the game with a lot of aggression a lot of toughness they played smart volleyball and those are things were going to try to stress
8826110 were not going to reinvent the wheel and change things because theyve done great in the past but we hope to find little things that can help each player get to that next level

8826113 vi har fundet to patronhylstre derude men vores folk vurderede umiddelbart at der er tale om en gaspistol
8826114 jeg har formuleret mig p et utal af m der alligevel har vi ikke kunnet f det her ud af ministeren f r berlingske tidende skrev det den 10 juli folketinget er blevet f rt bag lyset
8826115 vi ville jo have en ordentlig vejledning til borgerne om eu reglerne det var derfor hun skulle i salen det er jo ikke uv sentlige oplysninger hun holder tilbage for os fremover m jeg bede om skriftlig dokumentation for alt og jeg m s ge aktindsigt i alt for ministerens svar er jo ikke til at stole p
8826116 hun tager jo et bevidst politisk valg om ikke at viderebringe sin egen faglige styrelses svar det er meget overraskende og m betyde at ombudsmanden ogs b r unders ge de skiftende ministres rolle det bliver mere og mere dramatisk det her det er at f re offentligheden bag lyset
8826117 vi indleder ikke en kalkunjagt p baggrund af det her men det havde v ret rigtigt af hende at komme frem med oplysningerne i maj s vi kunne f belyst hvor meget eu reglerne underminerer den danske lovgivning men jeg tolker det ikke som bevidst vildledning
8826118 vi risikerer at f soldater sl et ihjel fordi nogle vil passe p fuglen tinksmeden et eller andet sted
8826119 det som er t beligt er at vi har en id om at granaten er rigtig god i majs men vi kan ikke f lov til at pr ve den nogen steder
8826120 det skulle dog meget gerne v re s dan at vi kan levere det som soldaterne har behov for men n r de med kort varsel har brug for at ve sig i for eksempel en majsmark i danmark kan det v re sv rt i de beskyttede omr der
8826121 jeg ville ogs v re tilfreds hvis vi kunne f k rt noget muldjord p et areal p 100 gange 100 meter og s lave en majsmark s vi kunne skyde ind i majs
8826122 hvis vi kan finde et midlertidigt skydeomr de i oksb l hvor naturbeskyttelsen ikke er s stram s kan det nok lade sig g re at komme i gang inden for et par uger eller m neder
8826123 det er nye og gode toner men med det kendskab jeg har til sagen skal jeg se majsmarken f r jeg tror p det
8826124 he had a wonderful natural power of communication be it through film song or just talking to people from the loftiest figure to ordinary people he met everybody at the same level
8826125 are smoky in their textures with a salty northern consistency their language clipped and consonental their themes urban
8826126 they spoke of deep feeling and intuitions about their subject matter and they communicated marvellously the freshness of a talent that was always exploring always pointing to some unexpected horizon or to some half forgotten treasure buried deep in the loam of ireland north or south
8826127 he was a great ulsterman and a great irishman a man of rare energy one of the transformers in irish life he was a courageous romantic a heroic democrat free of sectarianism and free of ideology
8826128 a man of poetry song of film and of a thousand stories he crossed every boundary with style and distinction he taught us to be civilised at the darkest times
8826129 i remember david for his smile his singing the general sense of well being he brought into meetings and the wonderful sense of balance and ease he brought to our discussions he was wonderful company he sang as naturally as he breathed he had stories and anecdotes galore and he simply was a golden presence in the room when he was there

8826136 my goal is to do a big league broadcast every night
8826137 thats my team out there it doesnt make any difference if its a class a game or a big league game
8826138 there is always some kid who may be seeing me for the first or last time
8826139 someone like ryan may be listening and he may be the only person of importance who hears you that night
8826140 were excited about the season starting and i think the guys are ready
8826141 we had to settle who our first team and second teams were the other day through penalty kicks at the end of practice
8826142 weve had some great sessions and weve got guys who are fighting to stay on the first team so that competition is good for us
8826143 we have two games and it will show us what kind of shape we are in
8826144 our first priorities in these games obviously are the results but well be working the guys in and out of the lineup
8826145 hes just trying to soak it all up and gain that experience
8826146 hes a quality keeper and hes really starting to grow as a player
8826147 this is a great place to get started on my next goal my next dream of trying to get more people involved in the sport of swimming
8826148 i hope im literally not a fish out of water in that one
8826149 they didnt have the high technology suits and goggles and faster pools
8826150 whats confusing is you see kyle busch and carl edwards with 14 cup wins between them and yet their teammates are respectable or fair but not even close to the success those two have had
8826151 its just tough to really say where we hendrick motorsports are at some weekends i feel we have a dominant car other weekends i feel were a fifth or 10th place car
8826152 so i still think we are maybe behind especially where we want to be we want a nice cushion we want to be well ahead of the competition and without a doubt we are not there we are on par if maybe just not a little bit behind right now
8826153 california is one of the hardest tracks on engines due to the fact that it is fast and the engines are held wide open throttle for very long periods of time between the minimum 7 500 rpm and maximum 9 500 rpm speeds
8826154 plus the race is 500 miles long most of the teams use california speedway as their durability test if your engine can survive california it is ok everywhere else
8826155 but more important the go to moves we always had with the old car do not work with it
8826156 we showed up at vegas and fontana at the start of the season with what we thought was the best downforce package on the planet
8826157 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past does not work with this new car
8826158 carl today and his entire team is much stronger refined mature and you only get there through having good times and bad times
8826159 carl is a little more laid back kyle seems a little more high strung from time to time
8826160 carl and kyle both know what they have to lose so i dont think it will last much larger its just competitive racing
8826161 kyle didnt like the bump from behind but if you look at what carl did it was a pretty smooth bump and run something you typically see at bristol
8826162 what carl did was absolutely within reason just good racing
8826163 bristol wasnt a good one for us and then whatever was before i guess michigan those two races
8826164 but even parts of michigan we were the fastest car on the track
8826165 but its amazing how momentum shifts from week to week we were not on the radar last week you look at the weeks before that the win at indy and pocono we have a lot of momentum
8826166 we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship
8826167 i think ive been a great customer and id like to stay with you but i really would appreciate a lower interest on my card can you help me

8826175 you are supposed to know how the debt must be validated if you
8826176 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8826177 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8826178 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8826179 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8826180 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8826181 i thought 30 per cent was the potential fall we could see
8826182 i think that might even now be optimistic i think 30 per cent does look a fairly optimistic number and markets are now coming around to that view
8826183 high ground now is totally at odds with the stark reality of a uk that needs badly to de lever de gear and get used to a much lower and real standard of living

8826193 after eight or 11 miles it reverts to being a completely normal gasoline electric hybrid which means you get about a 25 30 percent fuel savings but the point is they do burn fuel
8826194 a plug in hybrid with a limited range is a very nice thing to have
8826195 its wonderful that toyota is working on this if they have some test fleets out next year thats great but its not the same thing as a chevy volt which is not a plug in hybrid
8826196 consumers need to know there is a way to get the jump at the pump
8826197 our team has been in the oil business for decades we know how the industry sets prices
8826198 for years we have provided a service to gasoline distributors and station operators that predicts wholesale gasoline price changes with amazing accuracy and we knew if we could predict wholesale prices we could extend our model to predict retail
8826199 shopping around to save 2 cents a gallon after the price has already moved up 10 cents is a real shame it doesnt have to be that way
8826200 tinha um papagaio uma loira e um botafoguense no navio
8826201 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean
8826202 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8826203 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy senator mccain has been anything but independent
8826204 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8826205 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8826206 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice
8826207 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8826208 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8826209 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8826210 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8826211 the more i seek you the more i find you the more i find you the more i love you
8826212 this love is so deep its more than i can stand i melt in your peace its overwhelming
8826213 my sheep listen to my voice i know them and they follow me i give them eternal life and they will never die no one can steal them out of my hand my father who has given them to me is greater than anyone no one can steal them out of my fathers hand i and the father are one
8826214 an overripe or overgrown vegetable might not be a first prize entry
8826215 it can make a difference between first and second place
8826216 theyve grown them then arranged them you want to reward them
8826217 when i started in 1965 as a call firefighter they just gave me a pair of boots a helmet and told me to jump on the back of the truck
8826218 now theres more emphasis on the emt part of it
8826219 were near four major highways with motor vehicle accidents every day theres also more inspections and you cant ride on the back of a fire truck anymore everyone has to be inside and have on a breathing pack
8826220 when i first started there was one man on each shift now theres four shifts with five to six people on each shift theres also 17 paramedics four emts and a new tower truck
8826221 when i first came on the chief was out on the road 75 percent of the time now administration is 85 percent of it theres a lot more meetings two budgets a year and a lot more time in the office and as a result you dont get out as much as you want to
8826222 and sometimes i have to do dispatch just to get everyone out the door
8826223 youre always on call and sometimes this means having to get up and leave family functions but i have a good wife and she understands
8826224 and going away for two weeks of bear hunting in maine and canada
8826225 new pumps are usually a lot easier to test out than pumps or equipment thats been around awhile
8826226 sometimes though there is a complaint on the new pumps because when you go to squeeze the nozzle the gas may start trickling out before you feel a surge and see the price jump suddenly but thats to make up for the gas that had been trickling out
8826227 taunton has about 20 or so gas stations if a piece of equipment doesnt pass to be certified that piece of equipment is taken out of use until its repaired
8826228 if there is a complaint or to check on an oil truck delivery they might have to go out at night
8826229 we both go to the gas stations since there is so much equipment involved
8826230 its not the black thing with me i just need to see the economy turn around
8826231 its not the change of being african american but its time for change
8826232 most of the time democrats have taken office we have change
8826233 ten years ago even five years ago i dont think anybody would have predicted that not only a person of color would be nominated but a woman would be a strong contender
8826234 from the position of the democratic party it goes to show the country has changed
8826235 the mind set of the people is being more inclusive the waves of the past have been shaken off it will be interesting to watch the campaign from now to november
8826236 in the beginning i sent obama all sorts of money
8826237 i was hoping he and hillary would team up he can win without her but he cant lose with her
8826238 i want my taxes to be the same or less i want the country to be happy
8826239 my judgment is specifically placed on policy plan and character
8826240 its a loss to the kids in that community because its the only playground in that area
8826241 so what is the point of giving feedback if everything has been decided
8826242 we found windows that were completely missing fire escapes that were not usable because of rot and a fire alarm system that was not completely operable
8826243 it became a public toilet the homeless and others on the corner of pleasant street and warren avenue were using the bathroom
8826244 i think it really opened my eyes how i really need to change my game
8826245 after that i started playing a lot quicker and a lot simpler because i realized playing at that level where im facing a lot of pros everyone plays really quick and simple
8826246 i just stressed like i do with most of the players even if we are playing a great team you have to just take it as a normal game
8826247 listen youre playing for syracuse right now just take it for an ncaa game whatever you want it to be
8826248 its not just a right mid or a left mid its all one diamond together we need to be moving off each other
8826249 the midfield is your engine room and its the core of your system
8826250 last years group we didnt have that kind of time
8826251 they move the ball pretty darn well better than most teams in the country they freelance they feel spaces and they can setup forwards for simple goals
8826252 ultimately one will move into the distribution role the core role that shannons playing this year and thats what id like to see
8826253 this settlement marks a new chapter in making web sites accessible to the blind i commend target for committing to being a leader in online accessibility
8826254 i got two yellow cards we just got frustrated and didnt play our best game nothing felt right for us
8826255 with one of the yellow cards she was just irritated with the situation
8826256 i think her second card was a little bit of retaliation
8826257 its always difficult when a coach gets kicked out because you need that calm on the bench
8826258 ill always remember the first time i got scored on i keep it in the back of my mind
8826259 you lose focus a little bit when you watch a player and a coach get thrown out of a game
8826260 i think we did our best not to let outside things affect us but its kind of hard when its happening in your face

8826266 birmingham is the uks second city however we are first in terms of diversity im proud to represent such a culturally diverse population which serves as a model of community cohesion for other parts of the country hundreds of thousands of our citizens have a connection to the indian sub continent i think its important for me as a representative of those citizens to promote birmingham to their countries of cultural origin
8826267 i believe that my official visit to pakistan and bangladesh will be an opportunity to raise international awareness of the social cultural and economic contribution that has been made by pakistani indian and bangladeshi immigrants to the uk as a whole the message i will take with me is that birmingham is a great place to live we also want to encourage people from around the world to visit us and for foreign businesses to invest in the profitable opportunities birmingham has to offer
8826268 im very proud that chauhdry rashid who has served as my local councillor for more than 20 years has been given the honour of representing our fair city to the wider world his planned tour of the indian sub continent is a wonderful show of respect to communities that have been integral to birminghams economic success and im sure that he will be welcomed with open arms by the residents of sylhet dhaka the punjab and azad kashmir
8826269 in the spot where he used to sit and watch me
8826270 dont read this blog anymore because she is a republican
8826271 i learned that social support and accountability for me play a huge role in my success the core tt challenge group was a great support network i learned from them got energy and motivation from them and became stronger myself by the very process of supporting others
8826272 although i daily recommend turbulence training to friends family and co workers it was the tt challenge that really drove me to pull everything together and get the body i deserve
8826273 my loving husband and son were behind me from the beginning add to that the unmatched support i got on the tt boards and my dream of transforming my body in 12 weeks came true
8826274 negotiations are frankly going nowhere with the government and we want an independent person to mediate it
8826275 we are hopeful this could be the key to our long awaited breakthrough
8826276 the sooner they can set a date to sit down and talk about this the better
8826277 i would be glad to consider doing this at my regular hourly rate would you like a proposal from me for an estimate of my time
8826278 other responsibilities preclude me from continuing this work i wish you the best of luck in the future
8826279 i am unable to continue this work for you thank you for your past support
8826280 this government will not be bidding for the 2018 commonwealth games
8826281 the main reason is that we have got a critical need for infrastructure in this state over the next decade or two
8826282 there is a lot better ways to spend 2 billion than on on a bunch of sporting stadiums that will offer us a b grade sporting event for 10 days when australia can beat itself in the swimming pool
8826283 i am not going to see this state with the 2 billion of expenditure on sporting stadiums when the most pressing need for our state is economic infrastructure social infrastructure to underpin a significant economic boom which will put enormous pressure on housing education hospitals road and rail infrastructure
8826284 the flame will symbolize over the next 10 days the unique sporting spirit displayed by paralympic athletes
8826285 this spirit can overcome many obstacles in the search for sporting excellence
8826286 amend its acceptable use policy aup and establish a specific monthly data usage threshold of 250 gb month per account for all residential customers

8826288 currently the median monthly data usage by our residential customers is approximately 2 3 gb
8826289 we consider whether comcast a provider of broadband internet access over cable lines may selectively target and interfere with connections of peer to peer p2p applications under the facts of this case
8826290 although comcast asserts that its conduct is necessary to ease network congestion we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet and does not constitute reasonable network management
8826291 in which they mulled targeting the heaviest bandwidth users during periods of network traffic congestion and reduce their connection speeds for anywhere from between 10 and 20 minutes
8826292 ive heard horror stories from other women like venture capitalists asking if theyre planning to become pregnant
8826293 there are more of us and the folks entering the job market might even be surprised by the question of whether women entrepreneurs play a role in technology i hope so
8826294 the most important element in starting a web 2 0 company is your network
8826295 whom do you know who will help you vet your idea whom do you know who will invest
8826296 someone can be a terrifically talented entrepreneur but may not have the skills experience or temperament to be the best ceo
8826297 women are empathetic caring and sensitive with those traits women can tend to be too soft in a sales situation
8826298 rather than analyzing situations to know how to maneuver many women let their emotions get in the way of success
8826299 by and large women are intuitive empathic multifaceted and possess a strong desire to be liked
8826300 i simply explain that we incur additional charges for employee overtime for a last minute job and must pass these costs along to the client
8826301 the entire concept of nurturing and caring and having empathy for the other person makes women excellent listeners
8826302 and by listening they bond with their buyer and can be more responsive to the specific wants and needs of that buyer
8826303 i tend to listen to all perspectives and use my intuition to synthesize a sales pitch that will satisfy the group as a whole providing compromise where needed
8826304 being a woman in the room is already a differentiating factor from there i listen to the needs and concerns of the attorneys in the room and use my intuition to read the dynamics of the group to tailor my sales pitch
8826305 be prepared for that and for what your response will be when that happens
8826306 tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8826307 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8826308 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this he said
8826309 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy he said
8826310 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the no 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurised contents said mr walsh at a press conference today
8826311 it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing fuselage leading edge fairing
8826312 the cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door
8826313 the cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame door handle and overhead panelling before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage
8826314 while some of the fuselage skin had folded outward and away from the rupture it was evident that an area of skin and structure equal to approximately one half of the total ruptured area had separated from the aircraft and was not recovered
8826315 several small pieces of structural honeycomb material of the type comprising the wing leading edge fairing were found trapped around the edges of panels within the left side of the number 3 engine pylon
8826316 a small indentation and cut was found within the number 3 engine intake acoustic panelling located immediately inside the plane of rotation of the engine fan
8826317 as the failed cylinder was not recovered the atsb is currently working with the aircraft manufacturer other aircraft operators and the oxygen cylinder manufacturer to obtain samples of cylinders from the same manufacturing batch as the failed item to facilitate the ongoing investigation of all relevant issues
8826318 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8826319 the implication of a possible mechanism or condition that could affect the structural integrity and safety of other oxygen cylinders used in the aviation environment
8826320 i will never know why this happened to me i have stopped blaming myself and all i can say now is that i was in the wrong place at the wrong time
8826321 i will never be able to forgive or forget this horrible experience this has given me a life sentence of shame nightmares and pain
8826322 the pain that i have experienced is a pain that i would not wish upon my worst enemy

8826338 they holler and swear at people who live along the river and some of them are nude you wouldnt want your children out there
8826339 we call the section of river from bridgeton to maple island the 30 pack drop off
8826340 people get in their tubes with a 30 pack of
8826341 they are the crudest nastiest people ive ever seen in my life
8826342 i had six people walk right into my house one night because they wanted me to give them a ride to their car
8826343 one year they stole my boat i had to get out of there i couldnt take it anymore
8826344 thats their leisure time and when drinking is part of it thats when people start to lose their minds
8826345 excessive drinking is the common thread in most of the problems we see
8826346 i tell all of my customers to take out what they take into the river
8826347 i tell people theyll never rent from us again if they litter in the river this is the mother of all rivers and we need to take care of it

8826350 this is the first time any vendor has implemented a wireless solution for such a high rise massive spinning and continuously moving structure which meant that we had no prior reference and had to start from scratch in designing developing and deploying the solution the success of this project is an affirmation of our strong technical capability and our ability to innovate i am glad that we were successful in undertaking this unique challenge as it would be an excellent reference site for such future projects
8826351 implementing a wireless lan for the singapore flyer presented significant technical challenges
8826352 we are particularly appreciative of datacrafts project management expertise and its teamwork internally and with cisco systems
8826353 we are very glad that we were able to build the wireless lan for the singapore flyer together with datacraft japan by tapping on its broad consultation capabilities and proven technical expertise plus regional coverage

8826356 me parece que de las seis fechas que se han disputado debemos corregir muchas cosas porque es muy raro que s lo hayamos ganado uno y otros cuatro en los que hemos ido con una ventaja nos terminen por rescatar el empate sin embargo as es el futbol y en estos momentos debo reconocer que no estamos en un buen momento pero no para pensar que es algo cr tico pues faltan muchas fechas por disputar y tengo mucha fe en que muy pronto sacaremos al equipo adelante
8826357 todav a me duele el partido del fin de semana pasado contra jaguares por que se ten a totalmente controlado con dos goles a favor y sobre todo porque mostramos una mejor a en comparaci n a los partidos anteriores pero nos ha faltado concentraci n que es lo que m s nos ha afectado
8826358 somos concientes de que cuando nos alaban es porque ganamos y hemos hecho un buen trabajo pero tambi n debemos tener la personalidad de aceptar cr ticas cuando no se gana ya que al final de cuentas son constructivas para hacernos ver nuestro errores y en lo que debemos corregir para hacer mejor las cosas
8826359 pero tambi n hay que tener presente que esto apenas comienza es por eso que a m la presi n me encanta simplemente es lo m s lindo que hablen de nostros tanto bien como mal peor ser a que no se hable y m s por ser parte de este club
8826360 fue un juego muy parejo en el que ambos equipos crearon jugadas de peligro desde un principio pero en el segundo tiempo juan carlos medina y alfredo moreno tuvieron grandes oportunidades para ponernos en ventaja por dos goles pero nuevamente nos sentenciaron el empate y nos regresamos con un resultado injusto

8826380 i dont think about that life anymore it was in 1997
8826381 i have just been told the decision has just been told to mccain staffers in dayton i have been requested to not leak the name of the pick all i can say is that the supporters of this site will be pleased at noon tomorrow
8826382 wow and its over wow holy cow you hear about people hitting it out of the park and that one very nearly left the pitchers mound
8826383 mccain aide insists vp will be announced at rally tomorrow
8826384 sorry im in the traditional camp that says a baby needs a mommy especially a special need kid dads will do in a pinch but no one else can be that babys mommy not even dad i hope palin realizes that
8826385 i have 5 kids and my youngest is my beautiful girl with ds
8826386 firstly ms armeni it does not take parenthood to be responsible and if the way you speak to people on this board is any indication of the way you speak to your children then you have the lack of patience to be a good responsible parent got it and i never judged either you or martha until you blatantly said disparaging comments about me
8826387 a woman can be a mediocre tram conductor as well as any man but only a woman can be a mother however mediocre she be
8826388 stephen r maloney said i just got the following from a republican source in oklahoma sarah palins charter plane has just landed in dayton oh word that mark from fl and i are getting is that it is a pretty good rumor she will be the vp romney is out and never seriously considered as mccain cannot stand him that comes direct from the campaign
8826389 just got off the phone with my brother who works for a private jet charter based in cincinnati he says in his entire career there he has never heard of anyone flying out of anchorage late on a thursday much less flying from anchorage to ohio he also said that middletown would be the prime choice to make a landing if you didnt want any publicity and that g4 has the range to easily make a non stop flight
8826390 i dont have any idea but my gut feeling says it could be alaska gov sarah palin
8826391 its a woman walking from a convenience store to an apartment building while listening to a walkman i could see that downtown any day of the week
8826392 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8826393 it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8826394 i know im a better coach after going through this
8826395 because we had those three years i think was a big reason why we won
8826396 it was a thrill to be around them every day to be around excellence
8826397 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8826398 at the end it was joy you understand the huge investment that it took everybody was made to feel a part of it
8826399 quiet and not given to self promotion a very gracious man
8826400 i had an amazing amount of luck to race for 22 years and not a drop of blood or a broken bone
8826401 always fearful and throughout his career he struggled to find a balance between the perils and pleasures of his profession
8826402 by the mid 1950s he had become americas best sports car racer
8826403 this team does have a chance to be a good football team
8826404 the only thing is it dont get easier it gets tougher so we have to learn through the tough opponents
8826405 i probably should have been more conservative with the things we asked him to do
8826406 the young man has ability he just has to polish things up he has a great arm he just has got to make good decisions we have good skill people to get it too hopefully we can weather the storm until he feels confident and comfortable
8826407 you are getting ready to play an opponent that has about 20 starters back and they are a good football team
8826408 they have a lot of weapons and they have experience
8826409 he is a tough guy to tackle because he is built low to the ground and hes powerful and strong hes an all around quality back and he has a lot of good things about him
8826410 they try to mix it up they spread you out and run it and throw it they line up and power you they make you defend it all its a huge challenge for our defense to be able to prepare for this week
8826411 dad was proud of him but coach was proud of him too
8826412 he executed the offense well made the right reads and right throws and right decisions and he did a nice job of leading the team
8826413 its going to be a playoff atmosphere everyone will shut down in our communities and theyll be out here to watch this game its a great game to be involved in early and its great for our young kids to be subjected to it
8826414 we will try to prepare mentally and emotionally to play and the physical part will have to take care of itself at this point
8826415 the biggest thing on my mind is how we can handle it emotionally we just have to get though the game and just play we will honor what the gfellers want and thats foremost on my mind we have to honor what the gfeller family wants and do the right thing for our football team win or lose tomorrow whatever thats not even a concern
8826416 mike gets along with everybody and so its been really hard on my boys
8826417 i am proud of my players for calling mike and for calling some of their boys
8826418 i have never been through this and i have no idea what to expect i cant even tell what it will be like tonight i am really glad for my kids and for their kids and i am glad for coach propst that we are playing a lot of people have come to realize how close the east and reynolds families are it will be nice that we can look after each other on friday night after this tough time
8826419 i took a group of four or five kids on monday over to reynolds to see mike and his kids
8826420 we didnt get to see mike and the players they were in meetings and they had bigger things to deal with but they knew we were there trying to lend support
8826421 during times like these there are no rivalries we are all in this boat together i have cried for them and cried for our kids i told them i dont want to put them out there to get them hurt its not what you want to do its not why we are in this
8826422 we want to do it because its the right thing
8826423 we have ordered the number 57 to put on our helmet we seven on sevened them and we scrimmaged them and i just feel for mike
8826424 if they win this week it will be storybook but it will be tough on the team playing them also
8826425 every time he astonishes me on how low he can go
8826426 why today why not tomorrow there wasnt a decision on why today
8826427 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
8826428 he wanted to watch it at home with his family its a historic moment
8826429 the cuts have to do with the budget what happened last night doesnt change the fiscal shape that we were in when the budget came in out of balance not sure how you make that connection
8826430 report m nchen hat sich ja einen ruf als konservatives magazin erarbeitet
8826431 it is a mere 1 2 percent of the p305 billion allocations for debt servicing
8826432 even if the whole dswd budget goes only to those who live below the poverty line the welfare budget would only amount to p456 per poor person in a year or p1 25 per day
8826433 the us is using the marionette arroyo regime to amend the constitution in order to open the country to multinational companies and foreign countries to make use of the natural resources
8826434 arroyos cha cha is a clear surrender of our national patrimony and sovereignty and would only lead the filipino to worse conditions of hunger and poverty
8826435 the ongoing deployment of troops is not only meant to crush the bangsamoros struggle for their right to self determination it also paves the way for the slick entry of the united states in the mineral rich areas of mindanao
8826436 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8826437 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8826438 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8826439 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8826440 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8826441 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8826442 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8826443 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8826444 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8826445 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8826446 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english what if you have a person who genuinely struggles with learning a new language they have a learning disability
8826447 its a big step to actually put it out there

8826452 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi
8826453 surcaj ini bukan perkara baru cuma kali ini ia dalam bentuk peratusan harga tiket
8826454 beliau memberi alasan kadar surcaj itu tidak ada kena mengena dengan peningkatan harga minyak kerana kenderaan awam masih menggunakan diesel subsidi rm1 43 seliter
8826455 juga ditambah dengan peningkatan kos operasi lain seperti mereka kena bayar gaji pemandu pada kadar tinggi bayar kerja lebih masa serta pembelian alat ganti dan penyelenggaraan bas
8826456 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi
8826457 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8826458 the united states is being ill served by the growing partisan divide surrounding its national security and foreign policy
8826459 well were done with risman who do you want to kill next
8826460 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8826461 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8826462 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8826463 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8826464 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8826465 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8826466 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8826467 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8826468 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8826469 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8826470 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8826471 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8826472 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8826473 i like it when they actually do talk about the issues
8826474 you listen to one and theyre all the same you know who the attack dog is going to be the vice presidential nominee for both parties
8826475 its all a big marketing spectacle trying to win votes
8826476 i think she handled herself well and she brought the party together
8826477 i find it hard to believe someone could be such a staunch hillary supporter to vote for mccain to spite the democratic party
8826478 i think obamas very likable but i dont think hes ready to be commander in chief
8826479 you can tell hes definitely recovering but he still has it
8826480 the mans just hopeful and thats what we need right now especially because we work in retail
8826481 our mission is to raise funds but what weve really done is change the paradigm
8826482 it has been less about asking people for money but more about creating this sustained community of support
8826483 everyone i reached out supported hillary and i was able to ask them to come on board
8826484 its not just a top down fundraising model where big donations are all that matter
8826485 theyve seen this kind of grassroots campaign be successful before with gov patrick
8826486 what were projecting is a slight drop in americans traveling 50 miles or more this weekend
8826487 many colleges and secondary schools starting earlier is certainly a factor
8826488 we have plenty of evidence americans really value their vacation time
8826489 its looking like its a chance of thunderstorms saturday late afternoon and evening then it dries out after that
8826490 puffy clouds like you get after a front goes through
8826491 if youre going down to the gulf coast things will be deteriorating
8826492 and then we have the new storm thats developed hanna with the potential to develop into a hurricane
8826493 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8826494 up until now weve given magnesium sulfate only to prevent pre term birth or to prevent preeclampsia
8826495 this study combined with two previous studies suggests that giving magnesium before early pre term birth could be beneficial
8826496 as much as i want to go home its quite pointless as im not going to go to anything so its not gonna change
8826497 the people who have walked before have walked because they know on the outside its different and its going to help them

8826508 in the past these may have been viewed as victimless crimes
8826509 but in reality theres significant damage this law allows us to prosecute these cases
8826510 its going to affect the sales of the record and its not fair the internet is what it is and you have to deal with it accordingly but i think if someone goes and steals something its theft
8826511 it rips up the lottery ticket it takes the wind out of everything
8826512 the more you mess around with the details the more likely the album is to leak on the internet spoiling whatever big plans youre cooking up anyway
8826513 do your eats hang low do they wobble to and fro
8826514 weve all worked very hard over the last two years in planning and training for the next big hurricane and tropical storm gustav is going to be it
8826515 im not going to say theres not going to be problems
8826516 fema still has a long way to go before it will be able to respond quickly and effectively to a real catastrophic disaster
8826517 fema still does not yet have a sufficient surge work force leaving the nation susceptible to many of the same problems experienced in hurricane katrina
8826518 it sent a message to our employees that were serious were not just bringing in political hacks

8826527 as the time was short the star had to make some amendments in his speech annaiahs attention was totally centrifuged on the public so he discussed the nitty gritty of the speech with shivaji
8826528 you never know they can find you wherever you are
8826529 internet marketing exclusive is pure genius our sales have increased by 40
8826530 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
8826531 any time somebody says that they committed a murder we are going to take that seriously
8826532 we have no way of knowing whether or not richard cooey is just blowing smoke and making things up or whether he did in fact did kill somebody else more than 20 years ago

8826539 skuad kami sudah sangat lengkap jadi kami akan sulit mendapatkan pemain bagus selain yang sudah kami miliki
8826540 ini akan menjadi sangat sulit karena kami akan menghadapi klub terbaik di dunia saat ini klub itu adalah manchester united
8826541 mereka akan menjadi favorite memenangkan penyisihan grup tapi kami akan bertarung untuk merebut posisi kedua dan lolos ke babak perempat final
8826542 ketika porto berada di drawing kemarin mereka masih diselidiki oleh komite disiplin uefa
8826543 kami tidak menutup kemungkinan menghukum mereka yang bisa mengancam masa depan mereka di kompetisi ini
8826544 lyon akan menjadi awal mengatasi rintangan fiorentina terkenal dengan atraksinya seperti yang dilakukan luca toni tapi kondisi ini tidak akan menjadi masalah untuk bermain sportif

8826552 first and foremost let the hotel or resort know that you are on your honeymoon use qualified specialists because in the long run they will save you time money and avoid a honeymoon disaster
8826553 the first opener we could have won that game like that
8826554 the second one i told you it was a real good football team in wake forest with a minute and 20 seconds it was still 15 10 to the orange bowl team last year i didnt think we played very well against the huskies
8826555 and you cant blame them for not coming right now they dont have a reason other than the diehard fans who are there regardless we have to get those fans back in order to that we have to win
8826556 this is a great way to start the season off and get some more fans in those seats
8826557 i think this team is doing a great job as far as the mental part with the seasons we had but i do think we need this game
8826558 i really believe we need to win this game to start off the season the right way so the people who dont feel good about the team can note email address will not be published

8826584 we are now putting our launch for iptv together right now we are examining different options internally both the launches could be simultaneous or we could have them in phases what is certain is that iptv will be first launched in delhi while dth will be rolled out on a much larger scale
8826585 over the next few weeks we will firm up our plans iptv will be an integral part of airtels media business because dth allows us to go wide and iptv allows us to go deep in 6 8 top cities
8826586 iptv sits on top of broadband it gives me an opportunity to cross sell and deepen my relationship with existing customers using local loop or broadband or both my pricing for iptv will be triple play voice data and video for dth well explore single play double play as well as triple play and introduce it in around 5 000 towns and villages
8826587 we dont believe new businesses are a drag if chosen correctly we are uniquely positioned to leverage the existing technological knowhow and are exploring ways and means for cross leveraging our relationship with airtel customers

8826603 ihet was een zeer vreemde ontmoeting zowel voor hen als voor mij was het een shock want we wisten amper van elkaars bestaan af ik heb nu ook eindelijk familie
8826604 mijn vader werkte toen al in de mijn van houthalen
8826605 toen het mogelijk was zijn ook mijn moeder en ik kunnen afkomen mijn vader was wees er was dan ook niemand anders van de familie die hem gevolgd is een groot deel van ons leven hebben we in meulenberg in houthalen gewoond ik was enig kind en had het er ontzettend moeilijk mee dat ik geen broer of zus had en helemaal geen naaste familie al mijn vriendjes hadden dat wel
8826606 ik wist wel dat mijn moeder een zus had maar voor de rest hield het op
8826607 ik kon het combineren met een trip die ik sowieso moest maken voor mijn job in de immobili nsector
8826608 ik ben op het kerkhof van krzelawice op zoek gegaan naar naamgenoten daar kwamen we een non tegen die mijn vader nog gekend heeft zij kon ons doorverwijzen naar een boerderij waar mijn vader als wees is grootgebracht wij zijn daar zeer hartelijk ontvangen en hebben daar mogen overnachten het is onvoorstelbaar hoe ik mij daar thuis voelde toen ik s ochtends wakker werd had ik het gevoel dat ik mijn ogen opendeed bij mijn moeder dat was een leuke maar heel vreemde ervaring
8826609 ik heb daar de zus van mijn moeder gevonden ik had doodsprentjes van mijn vader en moeder bij en toonde die aan hen ik moet toegeven dat die ontmoeting zowel voor hen als voor mij een shock was we wisten van elkaars bestaan amper iets af het was voor hen niet zo evident om die vreemde jongen uit as te geloven en te aanvaarden maar ze hebben ons uitstekend en zeer hartelijk ontvangen
8826610 mijne lieve bisschop zo noemde ik hem ook een man van goud ik kende hem al van in de jaren zestig we belden elkaar nog wekelijks deelden lief en leed we waren als broer en zuster
8826611 hij was mijn grote baas bij wijze van spreken hij heeft toch het papiertje getekend waardoor ik godsdienst mocht geven
8826612 ik ben indertijd ook koning boudewijn gaan groeten afscheid nemen hoort bij het leven
8826613 een paar maanden geleden tijdens de paasvakantie zat ik aan een stille vijver in bokrijk van de lente te genieten toen een wat oudere man in mijn richting kwam getjaffeld het was de oude bisschop helemaal in zijn eentje ik heb hem toen aangesproken en we hebben goed met elkaar gesproken maar pas bij het thuiskomen drong dat tot me door ik had net met een monument gesproken was het toeval dat ik daar was en hij ook was het meer ik weet het niet maar het was een moment om te koesteren
8826614 dat doe ik ook nog altijd ge moogt het gerust weten
8826615 ik zat tien jaar geleden in de gevangens wegens doodslag hij kwam me daar enkele keren bezoeken die eerste keer vroeg hij me waarom hij heeft me vergeving geschonken ik kan niet rechtzetten wat ik heb kromgetrokken ik draag die leegte nog steeds in me en in de gevangenis ben je heel eenzaam met dat pakje van niets maar hij heeft me met die doodgewone warme praatjes enorm veel geholpen

8826642 ik keer terug naar mijn eerste liefde het promoten van recreatieve sport en sport voor allen
8826643 ik wil dit verder uitbouwen met passage fitness en nu ook met golazo sports daar kan ik mee mijn schouders zetten onder tal van recreatieve evenementen en initiatieven ik zal bovendien met golazo samenwerken rond mijn wereldreis en het boek dat in het najaar verschijnt over de 20 jarige samenwerking tussen mijn persoonlijke trainer eddy vinckier en mezelf geen loutere biografie maar een duoverhaal over de unieke relatie tussen coach en atleet
8826644 ik ben blij na tien jaar terug te zijn ik voel me echt gerehabiliteerd ik voel me geweldig
8826645 het ultieme doel van veel topcriminelen is gezien te worden als een succesvol ondernemer
8826646 niemand van het gori vrouwenkoor is in de stemming om naar de zangrepetities te komen bovendien heeft meer dan de helft van de koorleden door het conflict directe schade opgelopen sommige dames hebben gewonde echtgenoten ouders of grootouders die ze moeten verzorgen

8826650 de onderzoeken die worden uitgevoerd door verscheidene onpartijdige internationale technische bedrijven zullen de details en de aansprakelijkheden die met de oorzaak zijn verbonden vaststellen
8826651 ik vind het verschrikkelijk wat er is gebeurd ik heb er enorme spijt van
8826652 de feiten zijn veel te ernstig meneer heeft een jongen misbruikt die in een kwetsbare leeftijd verkeerde en hem zag als een grote broer
8826653 ze wenden hun kennis en kunde vrijwillig aan om de voedselbank te helpen met operationele organisatorische strategische en financi le uitdagingen
8826654 doneerden bedrijven vroeger een grote zak geld aan een goed doel en klopten ze zichzelf daarvoor luid en duidelijk op de borst tegenwoordig is het steeds normaler iets terug te doen voor de maatschappij het is meer een extra voorwaarde die sollicitanten stellen en die door een bedrijf serieus wordt genomen dan een pr stunt van het bedrijf
8826655 we zijn begonnen met een leeftijdsgrens van 35 maar je ziet steeds meer mensen boven die leeftijd die hun expertise ook graag willen delen zij hebben naast enthousiasme ook veel ervaring en dat kunnen we uiteraard goed gebruiken
8826656 als opperbevelhebber zal ik nooit aarzelen deze natie te verdedigen
8826657 maar ik zal onze troepen alleen aan gevaar blootstellen met een duidelijke missie en een heilige verplichting hen de uitrusting te geven die zij in de strijd nodig hebben en de zorg en beloning die zij verdienen als zij thuiskomen
8826658 thank you for your story i just posted a rather callous thing on gustav your post forces me to remember that people hurt with or without my graveyard humor looking forward to the rest and yes wishing it could end happily
8826659 saturn just wanted to let you know that i really enjoy your posts looks like maybe mittens tomorrow which i think will be fine for the dems and possibly offer some good comedic opportunity cant wait to see what you have to say about it
8826660 i just read procopiuss suggestion of kay baily hutchison that one actually makes me nervous heres hoping the mccain camps intrinsic misogyny keeps that one off the table
8826661 while i think being a lieberman pal is just mccain playing post partisan dress up i do love the way you played with it in this post im not sure theres a good vp choice for mccain im hoping for one with a great potential for hilarity lieberman obviously serves
8826662 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8826663 i know this is being thought a lot about in washington and at the white house and discussed and i suspect they will monitor it carefully and figure out what to do
8826664 this one was great lots to tell just got home 1 a m eyes itching really tired will tell in the morning
8826665 yeah the wait is the downside id be sweating about all the time away from work but then im finding it hard to stay focused anyway
8826666 thanks mary im very jealous that you got a ticket tomorow im going to miss the big one i know its tough to keep up on here
8826667 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate
8826668 jenni that was beautiful i have nothing to add except my admiration and appreciation
8826669 i really like the idea of montanas governor brian schweitzer but hes a bit of a left field choice
8826670 youre suggesting that obamas father somehow makes obama look bad im not following this is this satire if so im terribly ashamed at not picking it up
8826671 well it was better than john edwards and joe liebermans from the past two conventions plus he could have just said gobbledeegobbledeegoooby goobygoo
8826672 ive developed a fascination with reading your author tags health and feminism are my two favorites for this one
8826673 but what does it say about your judgment when you agree with george bush 90 percent of the time
8826674 its not because john mccain doesnt care its that he doesnt get it
8826675 for those who are paying attention this shows the underlying current has changed
8826676 historic because we are going to experience a tidal wave
8826677 absolutely historic im excited that the democratic party has done this
8826678 je ne veux pas rentrer dans une case qui sexprime
8826679 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8826680 she can carry two 5 gallon mineral water bottles shes that strong can you
8826681 shes working in the office of course how can she carry such i am just working at home
8826682 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8826683 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8826684 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8826685 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8826686 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8826687 youve got airway and breathing get me a good tube youre second line for acls drugs got it
8826688 that was awesome you knew exactly what to do and you told us when to do it
8826689 men fakta st r igjen john mccain har stemt med bush i mer enn nitti prosent av tilfellene
8826690 hvis john mccain vil ha en debatt om hvem som har temperamentet og d mmekraften som skal til for v re den neste sjef for de v pnede styrker s er det en debatt jeg er klar til ta
8826691 john mccain pleier si at han vil f lge osama bin laden til helvetes porter men han vil ikke en gang f lge ham til hulen han bor i
8826692 jeg vet ikke hva slags liv john mccain tror at celebriteter lever men slik var i hvert fall mitt

8826695 the bcep contract for the interior is currently being re tendered to a select group of two organizations that are currently delivering bcep services in other areas of the province
8826696 the goal is to have a new contractor determined as soon as possible to ensure no gaps in service
8826697 i am delighted gareth is staying it is a situation that three weeks ago i couldnt have envisaged
8826698 in my mind i thought he would go it is great that it didnt materialise a big lift for us all
8826699 you know the old cliche its like having a new player and actually in many aspects it is like that i really am ecstatic and so are the dressing room
8826700 gareth has a pretty good chance of starting on sunday i would say there was a pretty good chance of that happening
8826701 it was a job done i think it was exactly that
8826702 i was hoping we would pick up the tempo of the game and sustain it for longer than we did but after scoring four goals in iceland and making a few changes we got through and that is what counts
8826703 we have won okay in the end and to have 25 000 turning out especially with the game live on television i thought was fantastic i was staggered
8826704 we are in the hat now which is great the secretary can actually book the flight to go over for the draw and it is great
8826705 it is still another two legged affair but it would be great to then get through to the group stages
8826706 it would be great if we can sustain the progress in the premier league that is naturally so important but why not have a crack in europe
8826707 if we can between now and monday evening get a couple of people in which we have been trying furiously to do then it would give us all a lift and maybe sustain us for the months ahead
8826708 he said to me he would rather see me get injured by bowling too much than not bowling enough
8826709 because if you are not bowling enough your confidence starts going and your form starts going and its a bit of roll back
8826710 inside i was completely knackered my head had gone and if you look at it the people who have had dips in form recently in my honest opinion they have been down to that too
8826711 it is no coincidence that over long periods their form has dropped a little bit
8826712 this one has a bit more pace to it than the one we had in 05
8826713 but you cant rule ryan out of it either as he has been englands best bowler over the last 14 months so he has to come back somewhere because he has reserved his right to still be in the fold
8826714 it is not his fault he is injured it is part of the game
8826715 where england are now with the bowlers is exciting if we manage to keep everybody fit we can get a strong squad going to india and west indies and coming back with some confidence ahead of next summer
8826716 i have said to the captain and the coach what my feelings are and i dont really want to say them in public
8826717 at the end of the day i was looking more long term in the winter and getting ready for the test series
8826718 i didnt envisage coming back to play in this series which makes it awkward but that is a bit down the line
8826719 if i am picked for that game there is not much i can do about it
8826720 at the moment we have three games to win and if we do win that will be important for this england team as we head to antigua and into the winter
8826721 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8826722 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8826723 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8826724 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly
8826725 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8826726 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8826727 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
8826728 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8826729 standard liege were a surprise to me because belgian football has not been that great for some years now but it was an excellent performance against liverpool
8826730 i am delighted for our fans we have once again drawn the champions of europe last season it was ac milan the year before it was barcelona
8826731 if we are going to play in europe and we are very proud to be scotlands representatives we may as well start with the big ones
8826732 they dont come much bigger than manchester united so we are delighted we have done very well at home and are proud of our record
8826733 ive just got to decide when and if at the moment there is nothing concrete anywhere
8826734 there has been some inquiry i have had a couple of discussions a couple with my boss at cricket south africa everybody knows exactly where they stand ive been open and honest with everyone ive spoken to
8826735 at the end of this tour ill just need some time off and reflect on where i want to go in my career after april next year
8826736 if anything happens it is not going to happen until after australia thats where my contract goes to and where my focus is
8826737 australia was always the culmination of mine and graemes planning that was our target my thought process is entirely on that
8826738 i see our one day side now where we were with our test team two years ago
8826739 its going to be a work in progress and it has to be driven to the next world cup
8826740 i dont think we are the one day side we were and we are going to have to live with that
8826741 were probably not number two in the world at the moment as the rankings suggest
8826742 weve lost depth weve lost the ability to hit the ball out of the ground at the back end of our innings weve lost a key bowler up front with the new ball weve lost a key bowler at the death
8826743 we need guys to come in and weve got to find the right balance and the right personnel
8826744 we need to see them blossom and well see the benefit of that in two years time
8826745 it is but it doesnt pay full time i have a day job as well doing corporate blogging and social media consulting
8826746 yes the content on miss604 is about 70 per cent local content 10 per cent tech 10 per cent events 10 per cent silly stuff i do reach beyond metro vancouver with my social media and tech topics
8826747 i love to write and i love to write about my city
8826748 another reason i started blogging was that at the time in 2004 and probably still today a lot of the blogs out there were about vancouver but written by folks who were not born and raised in the area
8826749 well those who didnt know science world used to be downtown or that stardust in surrey was an institution of roller skating and sno cone goodness they didnt know the vancouver of the past if even just the past decade so that was my goal as well representin as a local
8826750 i think one of my biggest posts of the past year was about joe fortes the man not the restaurant things like that
8826751 i just think that vancouver is such a hub in this country for social media its a great place to be right now
8826752 and its not just vancouver its the lower mainland weve even moved our
8826753 its a conference on whats becoming the worlds largest blogging platform wordpress how to use it why to use it etc but also offering up blogging tips in general
8826754 im just excited that i get to speak at a casino
8826755 yep i didnt know there was a casino in downtown langley
8826756 i think its alive and kicking more and more each day facebook pushed it into the spotlight for those that werent already blog or web 2 0 savvy really and microblogging is helping it along
8826757 there are many other web 2 0 stars that arent necesarily blogging there are podcasters video podcasters start up folks etc also theres in toronto non technical purely diary style blogger but shes won webby awards etc
8826758 theres no real marketing plan although i think the best one for a blogger is to read other blogs and leave comments or simply link back to other blogs thats how you get the link love going
8826759 for the podcasts we love to have guest hosts as well folks who blog for other teams in the nhl are fun to have on for example an oilers or leafs blogger
8826760 i always thought it was bad form to submit my own stuff on aggregators as for an appetite for canadian content i think there is especially right now with all the buzz about the iphone and data plans
8826761 about once a month someone might submit something but i really dont think the majority of my readers know what those are faithful readers like my mom even print out my posts not sure id be able to get her to tackle digg
8826762 well the official blogathon site which is not up and running this year would collect pledges from your readers
8826763 without that system this year were simply going to ensure bloggers choose a charity that has an online donation button they can link to at the bottom of every post and that also ensures we dont handle any actual money ourselves
8826764 definitely it was tough last year it took about a week to recover
8826765 pretty much everyone on my blogroll vancouver bloggers toronto bloggers theres a bit of a gap in the prairies although id love to find a calgary edmonton winnipeg regina blogger i dont want to leave anyone out
8826766 i also read metroblogging and i write there as well its a global network of city blogs we have vancouver montreal and toronto metblogs in canada
8826767 the number one blog i absolutely have to read if i could only read one blog ever
8826768 i would say my husbands but he doesnt post often enough then id have to say matt good hes got local content canadian content and the multiple authors bring in entertainment and political commentary
8826769 i think if terry fox had a blog of his travels that would have been pretty inspiring the struggles the effort the cause the people he met along the way
8826770 i dont think id want to go way back and touch on any of the explorers although travel blogs are pretty big maybe trudeau hed be pretty witty and could upload his caricatures featuring him and rene levesque to with some snarky commentary
8826771 hes got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher
8826772 hes won doubles slams before two tournaments at the start of this year
8826773 he will give anyone a tough match very rarely will he lose easily he moves really well up at the net doesnt give you a lot of rhythm and i think hes definitely in the top two or three net players for now
8826774 theres very few guys that play that well up at the net and he moves well up there too it was a tough match
8826775 i dont mind playing against guys that come to the net a lot but he serves so well thats what makes it tough
8826776 when you find it hard to break someone and theyre coming in all the time against you then it makes it tricky
8826777 but i started to return well toward the end of the third set obviously broke him twice in the fourth that was the difference compared with the first three sets even though i won the set
8826778 apart from the game where i broke him i won very few points on his serve same again in the second set so it was really tricky
8826779 hes a really tough guy to play against and i was happy i won in four sets
8826780 hawk eye is expensive but i think when theres a huge crowd like that its absolutely packed great atmosphere the crowd are enjoying it theyre making a lot of noise
8826781 hawk eye is obviously for the players but also i think the reason why it came into tennis is because the fans really enjoy it and i think its tough as well for officials theres a lot of pressure when youve got a court thats that close the fans are making a bit of noise
8826782 i always acknowledge the part that peter sharp has played in getting us to this final
8826783 i was a young coach and worked under him for two years and he was a great coach to work for and a very hard working one too
8826784 i was tremendously disappointed when he left the club and i still speak to him a lot almost daily he wishes us well for the final
8826785 im quite sensitive to the fact that two rounds of this cup run were under him and two rounds have been under me so we have played an equal part if you like and thats certainly something that i recognise
8826786 we know that our form in the league has been poor but nonetheless we have earned our position in the final and we aim to make the most of it
8826787 we have had a very tough year what with a lot of injuries and then losing a coach
8826788 there are one or two other things that have gone on as well but despite that were in our third final in four years with a squad that has a lot of young and british players
8826789 we have had a poor league season and we have recognised some of the reasons why but were still a very good club in good shape we do know though that we need to do a damn sight better in the league next season
8826790 were looking at the final only now though and focusing on making sure we do ourselves justice after earning our place
8826791 weve made it very clear that our policy is not to recruit league players
8826792 thats because of the structure in terms of how were funding the clubs and the top end of the game
8826793 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him
8826794 but if there was a player like that then its very likely that he would not already have been signed by a gloucester or bath
8826795 thats because these players are being shifted around the marketplace the whole time
8826796 we do get players who make mistakes in terms of where they move and when they move we have to deal with agents in the game now
8826797 were not in the same league as football but the agents are starting to have quite a big influence in where they see players going
8826798 as a union were in quite a difficult position to be advising players who are under contract to their clubs as to where they should or shouldnt go
8826799 players do ask for advice clearly those who are english and want to play for england
8826800 there is enormous desire for these guys coming through the system to play for england
8826801 although theyve not really said anything openly as a group i think most of lads have thought about it
8826802 for what daniel has done and i think the fans love him as well if we can send him off on a high well definitely be trying to get him some silverware before he goes
8826803 daniel is definitely the second biggest influence on my career
8826804 i think all the players who have played under him have flourished
8826805 they have all played their best rugby over the last three years and it cant be a coincidence can it
8826806 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8826807 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment
8826808 players want to come and join us they can see the ambition that we have and where we want to go
8826809 we have the means to attract top quality players which shaun obviously is there arent many days left in the window and hopefully well be able to attract more before it closes

8826825 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8826826 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8826827 i guess by tomorrow they will have their act a little more in order

8826829 a key defining trend of advanced television services is the convergence of video content from numerous sources
8826830 the ability of set top box manufacturers to support high quality video solutions including divx will be a critical factor in their ability to offer flexible and unique viewing experience to television subscribers the new divx capable set top box from vestel is a good example of the type of integration we should expect in the future
8826831 with the growing demand for devices that play back divx video it was natural to ensure that our latest stb was capable of supporting the standard
8826832 consumers all over europe have embraced divx as a way to enjoy high quality video from the pc in the living room and we are pleased to work with divx in delivering a premium experience
8826833 the stb market is an important new category for divx and the t5000 further highlights our mission of providing consumers with a high quality media experience across any device

8826836 die kinderen zaten in een gevaarlijke zelfs levensgevaarlijke situatie maar iemand die kanker heeft gehad en nog in de periode van vijf jaar zit dat er een risico is op hervallen die vormt als pleegouder blijkbaar een te groot risico
8826837 ik stelde mij kandidaat en kreeg verschillende keren sociaal assistenten over de vloer die mij het hemd van het lijf vroegen uiteindelijk zeiden ze dat ik geen jonge pleegkinderen voor lange termijn mocht opvangen omdat het niet in het belang van de kinderen zou zijn alleen noodopvang voor korte tijd was mogelijk tja bij mij zouden de kinderen uit kapellen wel nog hebben geleefd ik heb nooit een misdrijf gepleegd ik heb alleen maar kanker gehad
8826838 het aantal belgen dat gezamenlijk stookolie aankoopt neemt spectaculair toe
8826839 de verkopers krijgen hierdoor het mes op de keel op korte termijn leidt dit tot goedkopere prijzen maar op lange termijn kan het de sector n de consument zuur opbreken
8826840 ik deed met enkele vrienden van de zaalvoetbalclub een gezamenlijke aankoop
8826841 we bestelden met vijf personen in totaal 12 000 liter doordat de handelaars op grote hoeveelheden extra korting geven kreeg ik mijn 2 500 liter voor 130 euro minder dan de normale prijs van 2 214 euro
8826842 zo kunnen mensen een superbestelling plaatsen m t bijbehorende superkorting
8826843 het gaat dus alleen maar over een plan niet meer dan dat

8827099 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ballgame
8827100 ive got to tip my hat to the boys they did some damage there in the eighth
8827101 i outlasted their starter and we got into their bullpen
8827102 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8827103 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8827104 youve got a lot of adrenaline you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run so i just have fun with it and try to stay as relaxed as i can
8827105 its amazing that it was as long as it was
8827106 yeah its nice to win two in a row but the goals not to win two in a row the goals to win a lot more than that
8827107 ive spent bits of every season the last four years up and down
8827108 was a bit of a surprise but it wasnt something i was going to let bother me i was going to go down there and get my work in and get back up here as quick as i could
8827109 i dont want to put too much pressure on that if you start focusing on that number you might try too hard or overdo it itd be nice

8827118 its clear that the second quarter not only wasnt a recession quarter it was actually a very robust quarter
8827119 this number seems to overstate the underlying strength even though exports are obviously strong

8827122 the georgia conflict appears to reaffirm the commissions continued policy on strengthening the security of europes energy supply including by means of diversification
8827123 it was unlikely to happen anyway and what has happened in georgia has made it a whole lot less likely
8827124 russias actions in georgia make those central asian gas producers even less likely to risk jeopardizing their relationship with moscow for a pro western route

8827126 if you looked at commercial factors alone the soviets would never have built the pipeline infrastructure from siberia to eastern europe in the first place and now europe relies on that pipeline network
8827127 finding enough supplies is the big problem and it cannot be solved just by the efforts of the companies in the nabucco consortium
8827128 russia is holding political talks to buy out the available gas from the caspian region i believe the eu should also hold such political talks
8827129 the way germany sees this is the best way to reduce insecurity of supply is not to cut russia out but to cut dependence on potentially troublesome transit countries

8827153 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind he said of pornography
8827154 im sick and this is why i had to come up some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body
8827155 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor he said
8827156 ive been living a lie for a long time he told the seven networks today tonight
8827157 ive been hiding who i am for so long i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
8827158 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart she said yesterday
8827159 i know that i love him i know that much she said
8827160 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
8827161 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me mrs guglielmucci said
8827162 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
8827163 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
8827164 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry she said
8827165 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8827166 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him she said
8827167 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
8827168 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back she said
8827169 we have changed the format a bit this time we have asked the schools to host the prelims which we have introduced this time
8827170 also we would like to request the state governments to host a school level tournament so that instead of the best school from the states we can have best team competing in the tournament
8827171 its probably not ideal we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8827172 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8827173 playing one day cricket there i know how hard it is but to play test cricket with the wickets and playing five day cricket its going to be extremely hard but its a challenge im looking forward to
8827174 the world conference on human rights in vienna marked a watershed in the way we understand human rights and how we act on them
8827175 in the 15 years since then the world has increasingly understood that human rights are indivisible from development and security
8827176 the council has now set up its infrastructure and can devote its attention to the full range of current and emerging human rights challenges
8827177 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8827178 and we are here we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8827179 i am a bengali and durga puja in west bengal is equally big like ganesh chaturti in maharashtra i did a series of paintings on durga puja in 2001 and was tempted to paint ganpati festival in mumbai last year
8827180 i was here from the beginning till the immersion painting different facets of the celebrations i also got special permission for five hours in the siddhivinayak temple and painted five images of lord siddhivinayak on canvass
8827181 harry has made no secret of the fact he wants to be there when the regiment returns to the front line next year he said the experience of leading his men into battle is one he hopes he can repeat
8827182 and with one mission under his belt he has the skills and experience that will make him an extremely valuable member of the battle group
8827183 prince harry is committed to his career in the army and he remains ready to do whatever his required
8827184 it would give cricket a global audience and help stimulate our push into markets like china and north america
8827185 a benefit of google e mail includes reducing kent states internal administration of e mail by between 80 and 90 percent allowing the division of information services to reallocate resources for other important support services
8827186 this is the fourth african nation where ids hopes to repeat the success that it has enjoyed in ghana egypt and seychelles
8827187 the ids valueplus partnership will provide the ultimate solution to the fast growing hospitality industry in nigeria never in history has any software package been so to confront industry dynamics
8827188 qualifying for the asian cup is only our first goal and next well see about booking a place at the 2018 world cup my contract expires at the end of this year season but both the aiff and i are keen to extend it
8827189 im aiming to develop a new generation that will make india proud in asian competition in the years to come
8827190 im very satisfied with the teams performance and their success has sparked a lot of excitement and passion for football across the country football in india has also made a giant leap forward at club level also
8827191 ive had two very happy years with india during this period the team played 23 games and weve only lost three in the process we won the nehru cup in 2007 as well as the challenge cup
8827192 we have a relatively stable first eleven now quite a few young talents have broken into the senior side while the experienced players also have key roles to play
8827193 when i coached china in 1998 they had no overseas based players they simply didnt believe in themselves but after the teams encouraging results like the win over japan in the eaff championship some top players like fan zhiyi and sun jihai made high profile transfers to european clubs
8827194 we have a host of talented players like sunil chhetri who have the potential to earn a move to europe
8827195 our seasons so long that you have to keep it in the back of your mind at all times
8827196 we have a mental idea of what the other team might possibly do
8827197 its really helpful with actually seeing it instead of watching it on film
8827198 if were passing well weve got some hitters that are going to be able to do some damage if were serving well enough our block is really strong
8827199 when we are intense and have lots of energy were ready to go
8827200 so if we have a game plan following the game plan and just working hard being the scrappiest team out there
8827201 im looking for wins every time we go out thats why we play the match is to win thats why our shirts say prevail note email address will not be published
8827202 i was supporting barack obama right from the beginning of the campaign because i went to high school with him
8827203 apart from my personal connection i also think hes a great leader
8827204 i think he cares very deeply about the problems facing the country
8827205 i think he has great plans about how to help the country
8827206 im very glad to have the opportunity to get involved with the local democratic party
8827207 i didnt talk to him personally but i think he has bigger things on his mind than a high school reunion
8827208 why does this happen why do terrible things happen and especially why do they happen to good people why do teens that have so much life in them suddenly die why are people even at extremely young ages so disrespectful for no reason
8827209 this early on and i think what we maintain throughout the season is we take it one game at a time
8827210 we take it one game at a time the season is a process and we look to be playing our best hockey peaking toward the end of november
8827211 we have another year as a staff with this team the message is consistent and common they know what is expected of them
8827212 its a new year weve got new people coming in
8827213 everyones trying really hard in preseason so it will be really nice to see how we do once we get into the conference games
8827214 it was probably easier for me because i took over in march and i had a spring with the team
8827215 for her i think that is definitely challenging to be able to get a team together in a short amount of time and get them going
8827216 weve been really working on just having a really patient attack and doing everything we can to finish the ball
8827217 they have new recruits we have new recruits theyre not the same team and neither are we note email address will not be published
8827218 i wouldnt have renewed the contract if i had known they decided to prohibit alcohol
8827219 its kind of like those tv commercials with the fine print that is impossible to read
8827220 the connection was that the respect to the human value and spirit the preamble of the american constitution that all people are created equal
8827221 its a freedom our boys are fighting for but we never use it
8827222 i am the reason he is married to lisa at this moment
8827223 he tried everything he could to screw it up and i just wouldnt let him he owes me that much anyway
8827224 their running game is very much an nfl type zone blocking scheme that jagodzinski had done at atlanta and green bay
8827225 doug and i have remained friends for a long time
8827226 i think dougs a really good football coach i think hes really creative
8827227 steve and i we talk probably a couple times each week actually and were very close
8827228 games like this are hard because obviously we need to win and they need to win you dont want your friends to lose
8827229 hes really the reason im in college football he gave me my first real break in this profession and what ive learned of offensive football ive learned from steve
8827230 were doing very little scout team stuff at this time because of the carryover between offenses and our defense is very similar to boston colleges defense too
8827231 being able to reconstruct the growth rate of dinosaurs based on their growth rings preserved during fossilization is a common practice among paleontologists
8827232 i just love getting taken aback when i realize something new about any fossil creature
8827233 i love the thrill of figuring out something new about these really strange creatures
8827234 the roe green center thrills me because it connects me more indelibly than ever to kent state university which i love
8827235 to kent states theater and dance students whom i love and to future students whom i may and may not meet but will surely feel supported and inspired by the state of the art
8827236 youre only as good as your school continues to become
8827237 im excited to come back and see where it goes
8827238 its great to know we have the support of people like roe green
8827239 theater and dance students will be under one roof for the first time in the history of the school
8827240 the front of the building will have the presence it deserves
8827241 they worked really hard last year to make sure that we got what we wanted and the way we wanted it
8827242 im looking forward to the synergy of all the students of the school being in the same building and im looking forward to having really top notch learning spaces and classrooms
8827243 we are hoping that it will truly become an arts center
8827244 were trying to develop a pathway for the undergraduate students at kent state that shows what kent values within its undergraduate education
8827245 with that were looking at different elements first the philosophy statement next the lers the other pieces of the curriculum and then certainly the first year experience
8827246 its an opportunity for us to i think help elevate kent to the next level by having this common understanding i think its a great way to bring all the professional colleges and all of the liberal arts colleges together
8827247 what were really looking at is a philosophy what are those guiding principles behind the decisions that we use when we look at our curriculum when we look at our programs when we look at how we teach and hopefully when students look at how they learn
8827248 i dont think it would help to try to trivialize what were doing by just creating a sound bite
8827249 it would be very difficult to boil a philosophy down to a five word sentence
8827250 for the discussion period that were in we need to have an understanding of what it is and what we are
8827251 we want to give them an opportunity to feel what its going to be like
8827252 i think that this will help to start friendships and theyll be able to sustain that through the rest of the summer and when they come back theyll be able to see some familiar faces
8827253 this is the part where we really want the colleges to design the course themselves
8827254 we think that by getting some of the things that students need to know done during that week of welcome that will free up the colleges to be more creative
8827255 we want to welcome the student population to downtown kent
8827256 i hope to be very judicious and make the right call every time
8827257 im anxious to break in and learn more about kent state
8827258 ive become more acquainted with my colleagues ive met them all and they seem to be tremendous people
8827259 you never know with these things and theres nothing worse than a failed search
8827260 we had a really great consensus among the committee even though we were a very diverse group
8827261 and i think it becomes more confusing the more you look
8827262 its something that theyre going to have to get used to thats what pretty much the remainder of the season has for us
8827263 its a process and were moving forward to the next two challenges
8827264 right now were just taking it one game at a time
8827265 first we play our butts off at wright state and work really hard and then when saturday practice comes around we just try to get together be positive and prepare for the sunday game
8827266 the players have kept that in the back of their mind and now its in the forefront and theyre ready to change that
8827267 you dont even think about the past you just look at whats at hand and do the best that you can
8827268 the uk proposals represent an approach we would like to see in australia
8827269 we hope in a couple of years time to have very convincing data
8827270 overall logically it sounds beneficial but we already know people have risks of heart disease and are not able to change their behaviour
8827271 they may not have access to the correct information they may not be able to afford healthier food
8827272 its not just a matter of identifying people at risk
8827273 they may not want to know that theyre going to get a disease
8827274 we didnt want the creation of a genetic underclass in australia
8827275 i love these earrings blue topaz is one of my favorite stones on a fashion sense i would recommend wearing these earrings with hair in a nice sleek ponytail i wore them to a birthday party last weekend and i received so many complements on how adorable they looked these make a great gift item too
8827276 metastorm insight provides the facility to combine the business data consumed or produced by the process or other data within the enterprise with process metrics to provide process intelligence
8827277 metastorm bpm can integrate with other bi tools the schema is open and accessible to be queried outside the tool
8827278 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8827279 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8827280 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8827281 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8827282 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8827283 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8827284 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8827285 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8827286 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8827287 the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
8827288 hey man i like want some tickets and stuff like 12 of them
8827289 sharing space has been performing really well most people ive spoken to seem to enjoy it its a slow hard process getting it out there but its happening
8827290 the last tour we did was our biggest yet and we loved every moment of it
8827291 in all honesty i left that all behind in weed im more than aware that its going to be an issue thats always going to be prominent when discussing the album but i reckon its time to focus on the messages in our music and what we have ahead for the future
8827292 the uk was amazing we kicked off the first show at shepherds bush empire to a sold out crowd and it was great to play at an unbelievable venue granted most of the fans were kiwis in support of shihad but we were really well received too which is always a good thing
8827293 the next gig was at guilford in a little town about an hour out from london at guilfest
8827294 it might have been just two shows but we felt like we got our message and our work out there which is great as sharing space is about to be released over there too were really happy with the reception we got and are looking forward to heading back over there at some stage soon
8827295 is that the line up because if so thats unreal the cream of the crop
8827296 come see us of course old fans are a welcome sight but for patrons who have never met us or experienced us before come and have a look at what were about
8827297 in all seriousness its a ripper line up and there are a lot of great bands performing
8827298 were not quite at the stage where were looking at working on the next album yet i mean we all have our moments of creativity but in actual fact flynns expecting another baby in october so were going to work around that and take a little time off
8827299 its always a good feeling being on the road and the fans appreciate it too
8827300 that just blows us away i mean in the uk we met some aussies who had flown up to catch the first cog show in the uk how do you respond to that do you just give them a t shirt and a sticker doesnt quite cut it
8827301 some fans have been there since day one maybe we can give them a card or something to signify their membership in cog space
8827302 there is a very clear standard in the constitution requiring not only just compensation in the use of eminent domain but also that private property may not be taken for public use
8827303 i i give him an a id give him an a
8827304 first major conflict since 9 11 for the united states
8827305 my own selfishness and immaturity i cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the stress of war the blame was entirely mine
8827306 i believe that its not an accident that our hostages came home from iran when president reagan was president of the united states
8827307 too bad guess this is how its supposed to be
8827308 and i dont think that youre going to fight to be there
8827309 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperment and judgement to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8827310 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8827311 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for the same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8827312 you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that in defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8827313 total nilai jual beli sebesar 16 miliar dolar as yang didasarkan pada formula harga minyak internasional 100 dolar as per barel
8827314 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
8827315 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
8827316 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
8827317 looks more to us like a normalization following a period of exaggerated optimism rather than early signs of a deep and painful recession
8827318 with spain turning down italy struggling and france losing a lot of momentum too a serious german downturn would not bode well for the eurozone as a whole as well to put it mildly
8827319 to cut policy rates in 2009 in reaction to retreating inflation and concurrent evidence of economic weakness
8827320 im hopefully expecting a huge turn of support for obama
8827321 i think that will actually happen and the momentum will be turned in his favor
8827322 hes a very dynamic speaker and theres a lot of other dynamic speakers at the event too and it will sway a lot people to his campaign and to his message
8827323 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does that say about judgment when sen mccain thinks president bush was right 90 percent of the time
8827324 they give you a little bit of more hope so that when youre out there for four hours trying to register people and you come back with two registration forms it reminds you why youre out there

8827328 international statements of concern are urgently needed to express solidarity with the victims to help forestall yet more violence and to prevent the further loss of life
8827329 we therefore request that you make a statement to call for an end to the sectarian violence and for the protection of vulnerable communities as soon as possible
8827330 mobs have been attacking minority christians in retaliation for the killing of local religious leader swami lakhmananda saraswati
8827331 the fact that christians have been made the scapegoats and victims of a vishwa hindu parishad backlash is deplorable and calls for urgent intervention
8827332 nobody can limit the use of knowledge anywhere in the world
8827333 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8827334 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by nigerians and the entire international community
8827335 us still working on revised draft and india still demanding
8827336 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8827337 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8827338 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8827339 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8827340 some indian officials and commentators have suggested that new delhi may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes hyde act like requirements if that occurs so be it
8827341 the indian governments demands have been so unreasonable that the bush administration simply cant ram an india specific exemption through the nsg without accepting substantial changes and some common sense restrictions and conditions
8827342 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8827343 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8827344 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health
8827345 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8827346 violence for whatever reasons is not acceptable and it is reprehensible for people to take law unto their own hands and engage in dastardly acts
8827347 we also condemn the killing of swami saraswati and four associates during the attack on the vhp ashram in kandahamal district of orissa
8827348 we are witnessing a total failure of the government machinery headed by bjd bjp combined to protect the innocent citizens of the state where extremists are wreaking havoc killing people destroying institutions and challenging the very pluralistic fabric of the nation
8827349 unless the government quickly quells the violence brings the culprits to justice and rehabilitates the victims fast our global image of an emerging power will suffer
8827350 it continues to be an extraordinarily complex problem we need to continue to press on it there are areas there are areas that we can do better there are areas that the pakistan military can do better we understand that its an area i think we can all improves on but it isnt it is not going to be something that gets solved overnight
8827351 there is a significant amount of political churn in pakistan that hes general kiyani very much aware of
8827352 as ive come to know him hes been very clear to me and not just in saying it but what his actions are that his goal my view is to do the right thing hes an extraordinary individual and his ultimate his goals are his principles and goals are to do whats best for pakistan and everything hes done our engagement indicates thats absolutely the case
8827353 he kayani knows his country a whole lot better than we do theyre an important ally in that part of the world and a very very critical and increasingly unstable part of the world
8827354 i think we need to move ahead president musharraf made a decision hes hes moved on i think we all need to move on and look to a future that is thats one we both understand and have a you know continue to have a strong relationship
8827355 im not prepared to discuss in great detail the specifics of everything that we covered but i can tell you i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be at the military to military relationship
8827356 for me this was a chance to better understand a very complex challenge in a critical part of the world and to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day

8827361 wahai orang beriman untuk bersyukur kepada allah ingat serta sebut nama allah dengan ingatan serta sebutan yang sebanyak banyaknya bertasbih kamu kepada nya pada waktu pagi dan petang
8827362 apabila kamu melewati taman syurga hendak kamu ikut sama menikmatinya sahabat bertanya apakah itu taman syurga wahai rasulullah ujar baginda saw ialah perhimpunan zikir
8827363 iaitu orang yang beriman dan tenang tenteram hati mereka dengan zikrullah ketahuilah dengan zikrullah tenang tenteram hati manusia orang beriman dan beramal salih beroleh kebahagiaan yang amat menggembirakan dan tempat kembali yang sebaik baiknya
8827364 bahawasanya orang bertakwa apabila mereka disentuh sesuatu imbasan hasutan oleh syaitan lantas mereka ingat kepada allah berzikir maka dengan itu mereka nampak jalan yang benar
8827365 sedang saudara pengikut syaitan dibantu oleh syaitan itu dalam melakukan kesesatan kemudian mereka tidak berhenti henti melakukan perbuatan yang sesat lagi menyesatkan itu
8827366 wahai ibnu masud berikan kepadaku satu nasihat yang dapat kujadikan penawar untuk jiwaku sedang gelisah ini sejak akhir akhir ini perasaanku tidak begitu tenteram jiwaku sentiasa gelisah fikiranku selalu kusut makan tak lalu tidur tak lena
8827367 jika itu penyakit yang menimpa jiwamu maka hendaklah kamu bawa hatimu mengunjungi tiga tempat ini pertama tempat orang membaca al quran sama ada kamu membacanya atau kamu mendengarnya baik baik kedua majlis pengajian ilmu yang mengingatkan hatimu kepada allah ketiga cari tempat dan waktu yang sesuai supaya kamu dapat beribadat kepada allah dengan penuh khusyuk dan tulus ikhlas
8827368 katakanlah sesungguhnya aku hanya menurut apa yang diwahyukan kepadaku dari tuhanku al quran ini ialah panduan yang membuka hati dari tuhanmu dan petunjuk serta menjadi rahmat bagi orang beriman apabila al quran itu dibaca maka dengar akan ia serta diam dengan sebulat bulat ingatan untuk mendengarnya supaya kamu beroleh rahmat sebut serta ingat akan tuhanmu dalam hatimu dengan merendah diri serta dengan perasaan takut melanggar perintah nya dan dengan tidak pula meninggikan suara pada waktu pagi dan petang jangan kamu menjadi orang yang lalai
8827369 demi allah yang jiwaku di tangannya tidak allah memutuskan sesuatu ketentuan bagi seorang mukmin melainkan ada kebaikan baginya dan tiada kebaikan itu kecuali bagi mukmin jika memperoleh kegembiraan dia berterima kasih bererti kebaikan baginya jika ditimpa kesulitan dia bersabar bererti kebaikan baginya
8827370 adalah lebih baik menjadi orang beriman yang diuji daripada menjadi orang kafir yang turut sama diuji bukankah lebih baik menjadi orang yang sabar ketika diuji daripada menjadi orang pemarah sedang diuji
8827371 sesungguhnya kami akan beri percubaan kepada kamu sehingga kami buktikan orang yang bersungguh sungguh dari antara kamu dan orang yang sabar dan hingga kami nyatakan hal kamu
8827372 hai orang beriman berlaku sabarlah sabarkan dan perteguhkan kekuatanmu dan bertakwalah kepada allah supaya kamu beroleh kebahagiaan
8827373 bala adalah pelita bagi orang arif menyedarkan orang murtad memperbaiki orang mukmin dan menghancurkan orang yang lalai tidak seorang pun akan mendapat manisnya iman sebelum dia ditimpa bala rela dan bersabar
8827374 sangat mengagumkan keadaan seorang muslim kerana segala keadaannya serba baik dan tiada mungkin terjadi demikian kecuali bagi orang mukmin jika mendapat nikmat dia bersyukur itu adalah kebaikan baginya dan bila mendapat kesusahan dia bersabar itu kebaikan baginya
8827375 dan sampaikanlah berita gembira kepada orang yang sabar iaitu apabila kesusahan menimpa mereka berkata sesungguhnya kami ini milik allah dan sesungguhnya kepada nya kami akan kembali

8827386 jacks teen america 5 released in blu ray tm format on august 28
8827387 jacks teen america 5 was so successful on dvd that fans storeowners and critics demanded the blu ray release of the movie now digital playground contract stars teagan presley and devon are clearer and more vibrant than ever
8827388 but it is a special treat when i get to include two high caliber stars in the same flick like teagan and devon those girls were born to fuck in front of the camera they make my job easier since all i have to do is step back and start shooting as they handle cock like pros
8827389 weve been filming in high definition since 2004 only hd movies can be converted into true blu ray films so our blu ray titles are guaranteed to be better quality than most other adult films available our blu ray library continues to grow rapidly and is as big as many available mainstream libraries
8827390 teagan is obviously the primary highlight but she is joined by some other very hot women
8827391 jacks teen america 5 includes the divine bodies of contract superstars teagan presley and devon along with industry babes dascha sandra shine jayna oso and keri sable

8827394 you simply cant have a relationship with another before you can be in a relationship with yourself
8827395 he was stabilised and was treated for his wounds after stabilising him paramedics took him to an undisclosed government hospital
8827396 we warned the city that these problems were going to happen and urged them to delay implementation by a year which they were allowed to do but they refused to listen
8827397 we have about 156 000 sectional title properties in the city and despite our best efforts we have managed to gather only about 50 000 of these much of the information was not usable as it did not have the information we require
8827398 we apologise to our customers and understand their frustration we advised them that they are liable for their rates account from july and then we were not able to generate the accounts due to the many issues that we encountered
8827399 we are equally frustrated by the delays in getting statements out we believed we had covered all contingencies but we hadnt counted on getting wrong information
8827400 very rough seas with destructive waves in excess of 7m
8827401 peter hasnt had enough experience coaching at the highest level
8827402 the only difference between winning and losing is that when one wins you enjoy it more
8827403 i honestly think peter hasnt had enough experience coaching at the highest level
8827404 you cant question his dream to play this way an expansive style and he certainly has a passion for the game but you have to look at the strengths of the players available to you you cant bake a wedding cake if you have the ingredients for a muffin
8827405 i honestly dont know what he peter is going to do he must either pick players who can play his way or he must adopt a more structured approach
8827406 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful
8827407 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
8827408 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful
8827409 were playing according to the same structure weve always followed but were simply adding one component to it and that is players making decisions and playing the situation in front of them with that comes a responsibility from the players
8827410 we need to win this one for the country the coaching staff and all involved with the team we need to regain our confidence and ensure were not still asking ourselves questions at the end of the year
8827411 someone needed to look after all these children especially those who do not receive grants and those affected by hiv aids
8827412 the future of our youth looks bleak as they indulge in things such as drinking and face hiv because they are not educated
8827413 i think i was a gogogetter all the time but now with lovelifes support and training i am even more excited we grannies are important even more so now because of hiv aids
8827414 the new prime minister would have to possess character and stature someone in the same league as anand panyarachun
8827415 brothers please come and surround our leaders to prevent the police from getting them
8827416 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8827417 our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8827418 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8827419 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8827420 barack obama whose campaign theme is change we can believe in promised thursday to
8827421 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8827422 i have a speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys
8827423 research shows that people were released so for public knowledge its important for the cambodians for the khmer rouge survivors to understand that
8827424 but to understand the whole history you have to look at both sides of what happened
8827425 this is confirmed by testimony that prisoners brought to s 21 by mistake were executed in order to ensure secrecy and security
8827426 consumers just simply couldnt tell a good distributor from a bad one
8827427 a vast amount of products is available but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards
8827428 we will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health
8827429 one product we found called original herbal ecstasy contained nutmeg which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants
8827430 yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications they could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis
8827431 there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated
8827432 here the jews dont like farrakhan and so they call me hitler well thats a good name hitler was a very great man
8827433 a serendipitous finding of our research is that the physical removal of a fingermark fingerprint from a metal surface eg by rubbing with a tissue may not necessarily mean that all the fingermark pattern information is lost
8827434 what youve leaving is an impression of your fingerprint ridges in sweat
8827435 the challenge has been incorporating it into the day job
8827436 its notoriously difficult to enhance fingerprints on brass gun cartridge cases what you really want is the fingerprint of the guy who loaded the gun not somebody who could say i picked up the spent cartridge case in the road after it had been fired thats the key evidence youre after who loaded the gun
8827437 if you heat the metal up after you put the fingerprint on corrosion takes place instantaneously
8827438 anything left is the result of some chemical reaction initially between the fingerprint deposit and the metal
8827439 all casings have been subject to conventional fingerprint enhancement with negative result
8827440 on one case i was able to develop a very partial fingerprint needless to say the guys in boulder were amazed that we had turned anything up
8827441 this is a very major accomplishment primarily because we wrapped up everything in one go trade in goods services and investments i would like to give credit to australia and new zealand for setting very high ambitions
8827442 we are preparing the ground looking for areas of commonality but the process is going quite well
8827443 ive been spending less and i dont eat out so much
8827444 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8827445 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8827446 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8827447 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8827448 what is important in this budget is that the government will ensure the social safety net will be broadened in enabling more people to get help
8827449 it will look to ensure the countrys economic growth is sustained and to bring back investor confidence
8827450 among others we hope that the government will look into cutting down road tax in view of the high fuel prices and also reduce personal tax so that people can spend more
8827451 soften the impact of the global economic slowdown and at the same time cushion its impact on the lower and middle income segments of the people
8827452 in the streets of philadelphia la la laa la la laa
8827453 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8827454 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8827455 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process
8827456 i want to know what love is god i hate that song
8827457 ga bisa mas itu nanggung kalo beli 2 saya kasih 80rb
8827458 tuhan masa lu tega gw kaya org goblog gini berdiri sendirian uda jauh2 ga dpt tiket minta favornya donk tuhan biar gw ga tengsin ntar pulang ke kostan ayo dong tuhan
8827459 yes yes yes yes yes i want the ticket too
8827460 i just wanted to let some light in the room
8827461 we do not look at what is seen but at what is not seen
8827462 its just you and me grandma you and me against that horrible bitch
8827463 i know youre the only one who really loves me you watch me from up above just watch me win my freedom
8827464 i know youre the one who always loved me loved me just as i was
8827465 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online casinos industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
8827466 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online casinos industry demonstrate to the general public
8827467 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
8827468 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
8827469 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our online casinos industry can benefit from this special night
8827470 i know the academy of online casinos design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
8827471 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online casinos award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online casinos project
8827472 whats your name home town major and what do you do in your spare time
8827473 arent you a little old to be in college then
8827474 dont you mean arent i a little young to be a gm
8827475 i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is
8827476 if we leave it to public personalities to lead the way we can never be free
8827477 for politics and history to be truly democratic open and plural they need to be won back by ordinary people like us who will take them back to the level of everyday life
8827478 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8827479 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8827480 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8827481 but everything is up in the air until monday 1 sept or tuesday 2 sept
8827482 the intention of the negotiations is a collaboration with brussels airlines as a self dependently operating airline within the lufthansa affiliated group
8827483 it really doesnt matter were trying to worry about ourselves and control what we can control
8827484 hes like trying to tackle a bowling ball hes very strong hes a guy who benches 440 pounds he sees things well and has good speed
8827485 its not there anymore the world trade center its not there anymore right dada
8827486 if you dont know where you are going any road will get you there

8827488 if you dont know where you are going any road will get you there
8827489 i gradually came to find it a useful ally in some obscure and difficult investigations
8827490 raised above partiality by his perfect confidence that he had only to describe the facts as they occurred in order to make the truth of christianity apparent
8827491 or will he turn his eyes toward the sun so he will not see the shadow of his body amongst the skulls and thorns
8827492 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8827493 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8827494 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8827495 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8827496 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8827497 the durango 95 mark iii is a reflection of who we are as a company our brand dna
8827498 ferrys car was made so that he could get into it
8827499 every designer that comes to work at porsche comes by to look at the 001
8827500 it saved a little bit of wire a little bit of money
8827501 hey senor i would like the worlds best beer a corona

8827504 his lips are baby smooth and he does this thing with his hands that holds me like a bear i cant move i cant go anywhere who would want to have you ever been kissed like that dawn
8827505 but whats even better is when they wrap you like that and they whisper in your ear they tell you what they are going to do to you tonight they get graphic and hungry your face flushes and you just moan thats the best way to get numb has that ever happened to you
8827506 she downed her glass of vodka on the rocks please while she banged out a tune or three on the baby grand piano in the corner of the bar
8827507 shes 38 and youre what 23 now whats the opposite of a cougar dude youre like a gazelle with a limp
8827508 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
8827509 im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family
8827510 im glad to have his endorsement i condemn remarks that are in any way viewed as anti anything and thanks for asking
8827511 make it a hundred that would be fine with me
8827512 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
8827513 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
8827514 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed
8827515 americans are very frustrated and they have every right to be weve wasted a lot of our most precious treasure which is american lives
8827516 i have stated time after time after time that was a bad decision that i support a woman the rights of the unborn that i have fought for human rights and human dignity throughout my entire political career
8827517 to me its an issue of human rights and human dignity
8827518 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned
8827519 but i have to buy it he doesnt know you love his books if you dont buy them whenever you see them
8827520 if you dont finish the first one you dont get the next
8827521 that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth
8827522 the is a new trend we have not seen in the past and this time around it is being done openly i am concerned about that
8827523 are these remarks brought up because of sheer disappointment they have to explain
8827524 we can have a dialogue with the component parties but what else can we do that is what we should be asking ourselves
8827525 the format in umno and bn is not right and change should not just be in the form but also in the content
8827526 umno also cannot stand alone there are weaknesses within umno but weaknesses also exist within the component parties
8827527 this means business as usual for another two years for the rakyat they feel it is too much to swallow
8827528 on the umno side and barisan we also feel very exasperated because it is as if we have not started moving towards re engineering and re inventing umno and barisan
8827529 oh god what if i saw it explode in air
8827530 i wonder if the engine broke down where the plane would land
8827531 i guess its high enough that it would come down at such an angle it wouldnt hit the house
8827532 oh gosh thats selfish a plane full of people die but i dont want the plane to hit my house
8827533 i shouldnt be staring at the plane thinking about it exploding crashing i might be willing an accident to happen
8827534 turn around and try again and this time with unity compassion and understanding in the forefront
8827535 i certainly have a few more gray hairs than when i started
8827536 offensive line coach jim turner has done a phenomenal job with them and i think they are making progress its going to take game experience to get to the level we need to get and well find more about the group once we get into the ballgame
8827537 they work well together communicate well together and have good chemistry amongst themselves they will be a work in progress though
8827538 theres going to be times when protection will probably break down or we may have an opportunity for a big run and someone misses a block i think thats just going to be part of the growing pains we go through but i think they are great talented guys and they are going to do a great job
8827539 i had a special responsibility to show a amp ms universally accepting environment to diverse people
8827540 my goal was to get us a new mascot by football season mission accomplished
8827541 i want to continue gates legacy and his march towards top ten public institution
8827542 we must not let gates advances fall but rather accelerate them
8827543 with the provost search students were involved in a very formal process with reveille we were totally involved with the vice president of student affairs there was a bit of a time crunch but she did give students a chance to meet with general weber before he was hired
8827544 we have the potential to do really big things especially if combined with other organizations
8827545 i think aggie nights is a great way for students especially for freshmen and those living on campus to meet people and not have to spend a lot of money
8827546 there will probably be between ten and fifteen thousand students coming through the doors its a big program
8827547 we have several organizations like dance groups and martial arts groups who will be providing demonstrations for entertainment
8827548 there has always be some kind of food and drink provided but this year dinning services will be involved
8827549 open house is something that makes a amp m different from other universities
8827550 the singing cadets is the second oldest student organization on campus and we perform a variety of music from broadway to patriotic and we are looking for new members

8827556 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington
8827557 estoy ante ustedes por que en am rica se est sintiendo algo
8827558 lo que las personas negativas no entienden es que estas elecciones nunca han sido sobre mi son sobre vosotros
8827559 am rica somos mejores que estos ltimos ocho a os
8827560 este momento estas elecciones son nuestra oportunidad para mantener en el siglo xxi la promesa americana con vida
8827561 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8827562 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8827563 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8827564 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8827565 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8827566 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur
8827567 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8827568 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa
8827569 terminar la lucha contra al qaeda y los talib n en afganist n
8827570 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8827571 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones

8827576 tonight wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 pm pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8827577 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail

8827581 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8827582 there are limited pieces where it use of contingency agreements can be useful but i think it is incumbent on the attorney general to manage the fee structure very carefully and to ensure it is not a windfall generally speaking if something is important enough to us well approach the legislature and budget for the in house attorneys
8827583 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8827584 do i live for the people or do the people live for me these people expect me to shine both day and night
8827585 cheney halliburton kbr ted haggard larry craig slavery is over obama is here
8827586 we just need change im voting for change i dont care what happens in any other country i just care about what happens here only in america
8827587 oh good this will be a quick light read ill dash off the review in no time
8827588 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8827589 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8827590 it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8827591 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8827592 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8827593 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8827594 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8827595 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8827596 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8827597 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8827598 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8827599 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8827600 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8827601 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8827602 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8827603 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8827604 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8827605 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8827606 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8827607 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8827608 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8827609 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8827610 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8827611 remember when you vote for a government employee the only thing they are responsible for doing is spending your money dont worry where they came from how white their teeth are and how many babies they can kiss in an hour just make certain they can account for your money
8827612 show me your friends ill show you who you are
8827613 the spokesman review intends to retain its current relationship with the associated press through december 31 2008 but will not be executing a new contract reflecting the changes as required by the ap in the new member choice program
8827614 the new contractual arrangement represents a continued and material shift by the ap of separating services from the basic package so that some services will be available only by signing up for supplemental programs thus ap services that formerly were part of a basic plan will now only be available through a supplemental plan approach this dilutes the value of the basic breaking news plan and constitutes a material change in the quality and breadth of the services offered by the ap under the basic contract
8827615 there is no new contract involved in what is a service upgrade
8827616 at the same time the ap will be working with the spokesman review and other papers to help resolve concerns they may have during the rollout of member choice which will provide newspaper members with greatly expanded basic news coverage
8827617 state and regional coverage offered by the ap has deteriorated in quality and as a result has not been satisfactory
8827618 is priced too high considering the quality and breadth of the services offered
8827619 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8827620 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8827621 obviously this is senator mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself

8827625 i experienced my most radical moments of happiness in the concentration camp you cannot imagine what its like to be allowed to lie in the camps hospital or to have a 10 minute break from indescribable labour to be very close to death is also a kind of happiness just surviving becomes the greatest freedom of all

8827645 in a survey of more than 11 000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the country conducted for the national center on child abuse and neglect researchers found more than 12 000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual but not one that investigators had been able to substantiate
8827646 one respondent cited as evidence the ritual abuse behavior checklist a dubious diagnostic checklist which includes many behaviors common to childhood gould 1986
8827647 our research leads us to believe that there are many more children being abused in the name of god than in the name of satan
8827648 our survey revealed that there was essentially no hard evidence of organized child abusing satanic cults that had infiltrated preschools or the fbi or that had kidnapped or slain babies in contrast there was much indirect evidence of clinical induction of false memories and plentiful evidence of religion related abuse including sexual abuse by catholic priests although much of my research indicates that children can have largely accurate memories and can resist strong suggestions they can in contrast as indicated by the dramatic examples of ritual abuse claims also tell wild tales cave in to misleading questions and make important errors the same is true of some adults of course all of the books about personal cases of sra were written by adults who seem to have believed their own stories

8827700 it was the same at beijing airport the first thing i saw on arrival was a sniffer dog but instead of some lunging german shepherd with streaks of baskerville style foam along its jaws there was a beagle now beagles have been sniffing around u s airports for years but this one was chasing a
8827701 oh look at little snu pi see they dont eat them they play with them
8827702 on every seat was a sack of goodies and we were duly taught to rattle our drums wave our chinese flags shake our funky light sticks and finally at the avian highlight of the ceremony
8827703 one townful of men and women would race on swarm into a shape and race off to be replaced by the next if deep below the spectacle there was an unspoken suggestion that it would be an extremely bad idea to go to war against this nation it never rose to the surface although one aerial travelling shot of fireworks exploding in sequence along the street leading up to the stadium displayed for us on screens inside was a ringer for bombing run footage from the vietnam war
8827704 we watch them both and ask ourselves what kind of society is it that can afford to make patterns out of its people india is hugely populous too but a delhi opening ceremony would be a more rambunctious affair nobody will ever surpass the mathematical majesty of that night in beijing and in retrospect that may be a good thing
8827705 you can imagine the rising panic in his lord sebastian coe who is heading up the london olympics committee voice they had two thousand and eight drummers all lit up
8827706 a new academic discipline suggested itself acoustipolitics founded on the statistical correlation between the size of a cheer and the current state of relations between any given nation and its host thus the chinese roar for pakistan far outstripped its muted reception of india echoing a preference that harks back to the cold war the american team was greeted with an indecipherable blizzard of white noise the flag bearer for guam was lauded wholly and deservedly for being enormous most of the female gymnasts could get a good nights sleep inside one of his shoes a storm of applause even met vladimir putin as he rose to wave at his compatriots he wore the polite smile of a man who knew as the crowd did not yet know that he had just dispatched his armored divisions to quell a vexatious neighbor

8827708 as for eva klobukowska the polish sprinter who won two medals at tokyo in 1964 and became the first athlete to fail a sex test i wouldnt have believed it were it not for the photograph supplied by wallechinsky which confirms that the lady in question resembled harry dean stanton after an evening of rye and lucky strikes
8827709 i could make out little of the mens shot put on friday night for instance not because it was half a stadium away but because even through binoculars it appeared to be an international convention of bartenders staged inside a cloud of talcum powder
8827710 the best thing about the shot put was the cars after the shot landed and the distance had been measured the precious sphere would be retrieved by an official and placed in the cockpit of an automobile two feet long bright red with a tail fin in short the idealized vehicle that i drew during chemistry lessons when i was nine years old now it exists for real and there are two chinese fellows with the best job in the world who get to steer it back to the shot putting circle by remote control one question though will linger after the games are done the red supercars are equipped with windshields but why who needs to see out are there tiny drivers tucked in there bred specially for the event

8827716 i am often asked if the olympic village the vast restaurant and housing conglomeration that hosts the worlds top athletes for the duration of the games is the sex fest it is cracked up to be my answer is always the same too right it is

8827756 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the united states

8827801 i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission
8827802 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism

8827826 you spent several years based on what the state pointed out violating the law
8827827 its not just a possession case so you present to me the dilemma of how do i deal with someone like you
8827828 he was selling marijuana in order to help fund his education
8827829 there are a number of other ways that you could earn money
8827830 he has struggled with adhd since when he was young
8827831 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8827832 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8827833 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8827834 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8827835 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8827836 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush of the time
8827837 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8827838 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8827839 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8827840 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8827841 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8827842 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8827843 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8827844 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8827845 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8827846 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8827847 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
8827848 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8827849 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8827850 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive

8827865 harrold is a far cry from the giant districts in major texas cities where gang violence is the main concern and most schools have their own police forces barely 100 students of all ages attend classes here in two brick buildings built more than 60 years ago there are two dozen teachers a handful of buses and a football field bordered by crops

8827945 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8827946 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time

8827980 i remember saying once to arthur koestler history stopped in 1936 at which he nodded in immediate understanding we were both thinking of totalitarianism in general but more particularly of the spanish civil war early in life i have noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper but in spain for the first time i saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie i saw great battles reported where there had been no fighting and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed i saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as the heroes of imaginary victories and i saw newspapers in london retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that had never happened

8828040 wow two blogs within a short amount of time whats up with that
8828041 hmmm im sure someone will need a sculpture of o j simpson made out of skin peelings and toenail clippings and look at the price
8828042 amai vos uns aos outros como eu vos tenho amado
8828043 our countrys greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states when we do send our men and women into harms way we must also clearly define the mission prescribe concrete political and military objectives seek out advice of our military commanders evaluate the intelligence plan accordingly and ensure that our troops have the resources support and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission
8828044 we must build a world free of unnecessary barriers stereotypes and discrimination policies must be developed attitudes must be shaped and buildings and organizations must be designed to ensure that everyone has a chance to get the education they need and live independently as full citizens in their communities
8828045 the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the federal budget this rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy robbing our cities and states of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges ports and levees robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on if washington were serious about honest tax relief in this country wed see an effort to reduce our national debt by returning to responsible fiscal policies
8828046 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
8828047 we are at that critical and urgent moment if washington continues policies that work against americas family farmers our rural communities will fall further behind and so will america but if we reject the politics that has shut ordinary folks out we can create a new story for rural america the dreams of rural americans are familiar to all americans to make a good living to raise a healthy and secure family and to leave our children a future of opportunity its time for real leadership for rural america to extend that american dream thats the dream of opportunity that ive spent my life fighting for and thats what our rural agenda will do
8828048 your own story and the american story are not separate they are shared and they will both be enriched if we stand up together and answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century i wont just ask for your vote as a candidate i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states this will not be a call issued in one speech or program this will be a cause of my presidency
8828049 let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age lets set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed lets recruit a new army of teachers and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability lets make college more affordable and lets invest in scientific research and lets lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america
8828050 from the first moment a woman dared to speak that hope dared to believe that the american dream was meant for her too ordinary women have taken on extraordinary odds to give their daughters the chance for something else for a life more equal more free and filled with more opportunity than they ever had in so many ways we have succeeded but in so many areas we have much work left to do
8828051 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8828052 playing i finally got to meet the twins his half brother and sister they are so adorableee awww i got to give them their bottles and burp them

8828055 the greatest risk we take is using old strategies with the same old politics
8828056 we need a president who can face the future without the tactics of the past to restore the legacy
8828057 if i have a faith that can move mountains but have not love i am nothing
8828058 love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs
8828059 very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
8828060 we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of jesus christ once for all
8828061 she takes the blame she covers the shame removes the stain

8828065 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
8828066 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
8828067 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8828068 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8828069 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8828070 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first

8828087 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream

8828089 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8828090 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8828091 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

8828153 obamites believe their candidates speech will herald a crack in time
8828154 their candidates speech on thursday will herald a crack in time after which posterity will speak of before obama bo and after obama ao eras and the transcendental age of obama
8828155 the most dramatic manifestation of an implacable racism coiled deeply in the ruling structures of american society primed to remove concentrations of blacks from places of value
8828156 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8828193 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8828194 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8828195 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8828196 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8828197 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8828198 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii
8828199 i might consider it i dont think its necessary but i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally could serve
8828200 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8828201 we own 86 donumms of land but we can only farm the 20 donumms furthest from the border it is too dangerous for us to work on the rest of our land
8828202 yousef and i have lost more than 300 000 because we cant farm our land any more
8828203 we had almond olive and citrus trees and we exported fruit and vegetables to the west bank and jordan and to israel now we will be lucky to make 300 from selling the parsley
8828204 they fire warning shots into the air and we see drones and helicopters circling in the sky above us we do not feel safe here on our land
8828205 i had ten dunumms of fruit trees just behind my house
8828206 but the israelis bulldozed them our land is fertile but we cannot farm here anymore
8828207 my family feels more personally secure in this area now that they the israelis are not shooting and invading our area every day
8828208 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8828209 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
8828210 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus

8828218 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
8828219 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
8828220 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
8828221 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
8828222 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
8828223 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
8828224 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
8828225 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
8828226 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
8828227 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
8828228 a good third of the regional banks wont make it

8828241 how accurate is the little article that started this whole series of posts
8828242 for that which concerns the ministry of the pope he declared and wrote that the unity of christians centers on the pastor of the church of christ who is the bishop of rome
8828243 i have found my proper christian identity in reconciling in myself the faith of my past with the mystery of the catholic faith without rupturing communion with anyone

8828253 i was looking at a photographers pictures recently trying to figure out what kind of advice i should give and having a difficult time of it because i felt like they had perfectly decent pictures and they were a perfectly decent photographer but i felt nothing for the images
8828254 it was intended to boost the birth rate but a legal loophole means the 5000 baby bonus can be claimed for late term abortions the loophole arises because abortions after 20 weeks gestation are recorded by doctors as stillbirths
8828255 he is not some popular appointment or a showcase appointment he is the victor here tonight thats why he dictates the agenda thats why he says personally what the democratic party will do if hes elected president he is the leader of the party he may be the leader of the country through a democratic process it is so vital to understand the history being made here tonight this is not something cute or wonderful it is something compelling and powerful this country has changed its history
8828256 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8828267 spence was sure of his direction and the positive yet attainable goals he set for himself gave the platoon a unity and esprit seldom found in any organization
8828268 the time spence and i were to spend on the island was a minimum of 24 hours and up to 48 hours
8828269 we were to look for a red light on a boat during the night and a red flag during the day
8828270 operation of a four knot sdv in a two knot current was extremely challenging
8828271 and required not only excellent driving skills but also a fine understanding of navigation
8828272 20 20 20 feet of altitude at an airspeed of 20 knots or an equivalent combination
8828273 they wanted us out and we felt the altitude was too high and the speed too fast
8828274 as drop master i was looking for the tell tale signs of spray from the helo either coming in the door or when i looked toward the rear and below the helo
8828275 i remember seeing spences face in the dim red helo light
8828276 his last words to me were weve got to get back to grayback
8828277 but i could see the helos sea spray especially on the dark sea surface
8828278 i knew right away that we were too high and too fast
8828279 i exited and counted one thousand two thousand three thousand followed by god dammit and then i hit the water i believe by my count that i was over 50 feet possibly even 60 feet
8828280 a combination of too much speed and altitude did not allow any jumper to get a proper body position to enter the water all four of us were injured
8828281 in nearly five years ive been given no information about exactly what happened at the scene of the accident
8828282 the naval service is rightly stringent in awarding the purple heart and in assigning the status of killed in action
8828283 but in the complicated world in which we have lived since the end of world war ii many who perished during operational missions directly related to national defense paid a price that was clearly measurable in the cold wars victory
8828284 the secretary of the navy must have designated the individual kia killed in action on the casualty report lt dry was not noted in this category
8828285 his memory will remain with us so long as man values positive leadership and courage in the face of danger

8828292 one hour into the flight there was a big bang then the plane started going down
8828293 there was wind swirling around the plane and some condensation
8828294 there was a terrific boom and bits of wood and debris just flew forward into first class and the oxygen masks dropped down
8828295 it was absolutely terrifying but i have to say everyone was very calm
8828296 there is a big hole on the right side near the wing
8828297 the plane lost pressure so the pilot had to get the aircraft down below 12 000 feet pretty quickly
8828298 when adversity knocks on your door how do you respond are you a carrot an egg or a coffee bean

8828302 what do you mean that one person can be considered the author on a film that 500 people worked on
8828303 what do you mean it has to be the director why not the scriptwriter the producer the cinematographer or while were at it the key grip

8828330 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism
8828331 well anybody would be better than mccain and especially obama that is a pathetic anemic argument linking mccain to bush ignores mccains record en toto i e a mistake
8828332 now obama is whining that its political malpractice to leak the name of mccains vp tonight
8828333 i cant remember the last time a presidential candidate hoped for a bad economy for political gain
8828334 the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa of 2005
8828335 if i had your hair id be president you know what i mean i wouldnt be screwing around with this job
8828336 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8828337 interesting joes mouth is going to get him in trouble in the next few months
8828338 unless whites vote on june 2 blacks will control the state
8828339 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain
8828340 this all sounds very well and good but how are you going to pay for all of it
8828341 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8828342 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8828343 lets say for a minute obama gives a tax break to 95 of americans increases services all funded by what the top 5 can you say welfare state do you honestly think im gonna keep working my off to hand more taxes to the govt think again
8828344 here we go doom and gloom hey obama didnt you and your buddy wright buy mansions the past 8 years why yes you did
8828345 he said mccain voted with bush 90 of the time
8828346 no estoy hablando de los aspectos financieros de la recaudaci n habl sobre ir uno a uno con estos levanta sus pu os
8828347 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8828348 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8828349 may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8828350 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8828351 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill
8828352 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8828353 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8828354 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism
8828355 the more i learn about nobama the more i hope he disappears from the political arena completely
8828356 lincoln killed well over half a million of his own citizens i wouldnt consider being compared to lincoln a positive
8828357 if it wasnt for lincoln there would probably 4 different countries between canada and mexico
8828358 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact
8828359 dont be sheep aug 28 2008 10 14 54 pm
8828360 al gore has done more to raise awareness of global environmental issues than anyone on earth i think
8828361 in his state of the union addresses as president he twice called for the deportation of blacks
8828362 i believe it would be better to export them all to some fertile country with a good climate which they could have to themselves
8828363 clinton and gore have the blood of 3 000 americans going to work on sept 11 2001 on their hands how dare we give either of them the time of day they are pathetic and immoral at least our soldiers in the middle east are trained and armed my son went to work in lower manhattan that day armed with his briefcase
8828364 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country
8828365 odd that he would compare obama with the first republican president
8828366 just trust me im older and have more experience things like this happen nobody wants them to happen they just do
8828367 his brave actions in the line of fire saved the lives of many of his teammates
8828368 look you all are letting this thing go too far
8828369 boss i cant stop it because i didnt start it
8828370 im not even in it much less at the head of it
8828371 these negroes are doing things on their own theyre running ahead of us

8828374 we had good negotiation with the thai side we agreed with each other on one point and another but the cambodian side didnt agree the thai sides request to review the border lines with us we already had border lines with the thai side according to the treaties signed by france and thailand in 1904 and 1907 it was international border
8828375 this was the hottest issue during the meeting but we just couldnt accept it
8828376 we couldnt accept it because france and thailand signed border treaties in 1904 and 1907 actually we already had border lines and they were stipulated in these international treaties

8828460 there are a lot of things we can take from the newcastle game
8828461 but how many times have we seen managers like me sitting here after a big game in the cup and then going back to the league which is our bread and butter and not getting a result or a good performance
8828462 so it is obvious we have got to take that pleasing effort into tomorrows game against doncaster who will be very well organised
8828463 they play with one central striker a holding midfielder and to a system that suits them and has been successful for them
8828464 it is no harder or easier than any other game in this league but it is one that we dont want to be finishing on a bad note ahead of two weeks without a game because that lingers so we want to go into the two week break on a positive note to set us up for when we get back
8828465 i have been pleased with michael doyle who has been the man here in recent years
8828466 we brought in two midfielders in the summer but hes raised the bar of his own performance
8828467 he has slimmed down and you could see the other night that he is desperate to play and i am glad hes back because we want good competition in the team
8828468 that was marcuss first game for us he had a bad crack on his foot in pre season and we had to throw him in when hes never played at right back
8828469 you could see he was getting caught out of position and it was hard for him because we are playing square pegs in round holes
8828470 we have brought in six new players but unfortunately stephen wright is not quite fit and we are looking to try to bring in a short term loan signing if we can get someone in before saturday that will be great
8828471 it is not fair on marcus to play out of position he will get no thanks for it although he will from me because he was trying to do a job for the team and i appreciate that
8828472 we are away from home and we can play jay tabb anywhere because he is more defensive than any of the other wingers but if we have to go with marcus again it might change one or two things in terms of the dynamics of the team

8828494 the path to recruiting and retaining the so called facebook generation is not through fancy gimmicks and traditional advertising its through meaning spirit and tech savvy company promotion says ter blogger and social media strategist was the keynote speaker at ebnc and ifebps recent sold out canadian benefits conference
8828495 maffins address was liberally spotted with light hearted stories but it was also more than a few of the associations membership were making notes for future reference
8828496 tod packed the house in both sessions and he delivered he has an enormous wealth of expertise on the whole gamut related to social media and the web 2 0 but content aside he was also so as a presenter that you couldnt help but have a fabulous time along the way what was clear to me was that this guy is authentic hes passionate about what he does and does a terrific job in engaging his audiences
8828497 mccains top strategists argue that the bush coalition that won the last two presidential elections is dead and must be replaced by a new one that extends to the left
8828498 mccain is a suicidal choice for republicans because on every issue other than the war he stands for capitulation to the left there are three big domestic issues that will be decided by the 2008 election socialized medicine higher taxes and global warming regulations the democrats are in favor of all three and john mccain wont stop them

8828503 my concern is if you help this organization others are going to be lined up outside the door
8828504 i see it creating a sense of entitlement and it will never go away
8828505 there is a lot of rhetoric emotions and good ideas but no substance
8828506 many of us have come from other parts of the country and are more than pleasantly surprised to see this education and conservation jewel
8828507 while it might be difficult for you to take a position to support the zoo we need you to take the lead
8828508 in my opinion you can never replace the zoo or the animal collection

8828514 to me its the best place we play as they respond to our music and make us believe they really enjoy it
8828515 we play bluegrass and gospel and really enjoy playing for audiences
8828516 the barrineau park audience really gets into the music we played there in may and i remember one man from the audience came on stage and danced while we played
8828517 we have the best audience anywhere and they usually fill the auditorium by 7 30 they have a passion for the music and their fervor pulls out everything the musicians have to give

8828531 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8828532 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8828533 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8828534 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8828535 this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort

8828544 we have eight cars at our location on pensacola beach during the peak summer season our cars are running constantly we are open seven days a week and each day has been busy
8828545 individuals have to fill out the necessary paperwork or rental contracts before we can put them in a funny car

8828556 its very hard to find good sushi chefs especially nowadays
8828557 its in our industrys interest to build a not for profit school
8828558 sushi is the core of japanese food culture in the u s but with the increase of sushi restaurants we are finding a lack of chefs and the techniques of local sushi chefs is declining
8828559 living in japan you know that youre not supposed to eat certain fish in certain seasons here anything goes people think raw fish is raw fish
8828560 seasoning and flavors are changing a lot compared to the traditional way sometimes its good sometimes its bad the good part is that we are dealing with american tastes so we should adjust flavors and some people do it well but some fish some sauces some vegetables dont match sometimes thats the bad part if i can teach how to make sushi well thats good

8828570 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8828571 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8828572 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done im john mccain and i approved this message
8828573 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8828574 my candidate is barack obama and he must be our president
8828575 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8828576 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8828577 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8828578 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8828579 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8828580 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8828581 hawaii the land of aloha the birthplace of barack obama
8828582 were two hours in and theres been nothing compelling so far
8828583 when the stadium is empty and all the speeches are finally done barack obama still will not be ready to be president
8828584 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8828585 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8828586 proud supporter of barack obama she dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8828587 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8828588 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8828589 champagne for my real friends real pain for my sham friends
8828590 forty five years to the day after a young preacher called out
8828591 yes we are americans this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
8828592 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election
8828593 wake up america this is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left this is call for you to go from down to up
8828594 my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8828595 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8828596 so remember when we choose a commander in chief this november we are electing judgment and character not years in the senate or years on this earth time and again barack obama has seen farther thought harder and listened better and time and again barack obama has been proven right
8828597 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8828598 what an honor to be here on this powerful night what an honor to speak not just to those gathered here in denver but to homes across america and not just those owned by john mccain
8828599 so why is this election so close well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8828600 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8828601 look at you just yesterday you were a baby and now youre 82
8828602 i received my order today and everything is great ill be back you made the experience trouble free and fast

8828610 i think ive just found another way to keep the supplies coming and best of all they will come straight to me this is terrific in oh so many ways
8828611 i have never had such great service from an su demonstrator and i used to be one holy cow girl you rock
8828612 i love the fact that i can go to your site anytime you can bet ill be back and place an order
8828613 you know this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
8828614 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8828615 umm excuse me god but they just were swearing and using your name in vain just last week and their family isnt totally perfect and goddddd how dare you use them what about me i pray
8828616 god calls us to judge the prophecy not the prophet
8828617 my beloved you are set apart you are chosen youre not meant to fit in because you dont fit in or wont fit in thats not my place for you
8828618 no watch read it like youve never read it in your life before never heard of it i want to show you something
8828619 be the change you want to see in the world
8828620 consistent revenue streams even in times of wider economic uncertainty
8828621 gun factories themselves are very rare and there have only been a relatively small number in recent years
8828622 these are self taught people who are supplying directly into criminal networks
8828623 they were weapons produced solely for killing and in our view the only possible consequence of their actions was the endangering of human life
8828624 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings deaths murders mayhem in inner city london
8828625 we think reading is sitting down and reading a novel but there are all sorts of reading
8828626 kids can get as engrossed in a football magazine as they can in a history book or novel we shouldnt be dismissive of other forms of literature i used to read tons of comic books when i was a kid
8828627 were always looking for new ways to get people interested especially the sort of person who wouldnt be hanging around in a childrens bookshop or reading a worthy magazine in a school library this is a way of getting other kids interested who might not know about the books
8828628 its just finding the time to get it right its very difficult to find a kid with the charisma to pull off the character of bond at that age
8828629 hey yessy open your eyes dont you see that she is not even try to not hurting your feelings dont you understand that she just same with other sweet and nice thing with the blody knife behind their back she is not something else she just same with others

8828655 no one was going to hire a 64 year old man for a good paying job
8828656 but the white guys who usually vote democratic but who sometimes stray over to the republicans we dont have them yet
8828657 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8828658 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8828659 because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan i see my grandfather who signed up after pearl harbor marched in pattons army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill
8828660 in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift i think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
8828661 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8828662 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8828663 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8828664 its not that john mccain doesnt care its that john mccain doesnt get it
8828665 so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8828666 es zeigt dass wir essenzielle sozialen f higkeiten haben die auch ohne viel explizites lehren zutage treten
8828667 diese kosten m ssen erst einmal verdient werden um gegen ber dem vergleichsindex einen mehrwert zu bieten
8828668 f r die bereiche unternehmens und hochzinsanleihen sehe ich aktive manager im vorteil
8828669 bei diesen schuldnern bestehen teilweise deutliche ausfallrisiken und die analyse der emittenten kann sinnvollen mehrwert erzielen
8828670 wie die vorigen monate gezeigt haben birgt es aber auch deutliche risiken
8828671 w hrend der dws fonds auch in geb ndelte kreditpakete sogenannte cdos investiert mischt der fidelity fonds sehr aktiv titel aus schwellenl ndern abs und hochzinsanleihen bei
8828672 zudem legen beide einen hohen anteil in bankenanleihen an die besonders hohe wertverluste verzeichneten
8828673 alle sprechen abf llig vom italienischen fu ball und kritisieren dass er nicht spektakul r genug ist heute haben wir die kritiker mit vier sch nen toren widergelegt
8828674 ich m chte nicht arrogant erscheinen aber ich habe die champions league gewonnen ich bin etwas besonderes
8828675 er ist zu alt um eine siegermentalit t zu entwickeln
8828676 es gibt da noch nichts anzuk ndigen aber ich wei dass das diskutiert wird
8828677 anw rfe die usa h tten ihn angefacht sind v llig gegenstandslos und aberwitzig so einfach ist das
8828678 aufh ren andere f r die aggression verantwortlich zu machen die es gegen ber einem nachbarland gezeigt hat
8828679 nun fragt sich der rest der welt nat rlich wie china diese st rke nutzen wird
8828680 sorgf ltig verputze fassade kann nicht den polizeistaat verbergen der auf den menschenrechten herumtrampelt
8828681 wir haben nichts verbotenes getan und werden weiter f r unser recht k mpfen
8828682 f r anleger die ihr portfolio breiter diversifizieren und damit stabilisieren m chten bietet sich die direkte investition in rohstoffe selbst an
8828683 denn die preise von rohstoffen entwickeln sich im gegensatz zu den aktien von rohstoffunternehmen relativ unabh ngig von anderen anlageklassen wenn die aktien oder rentenkurse fallen k nnen die preise f r bestimmte rohstoffe trotzdem steigen allerdings sind die notierungen von rohstoffen kurzfristig volatiler
8828684 langfristig sprechen viele faktoren f r eine fortf hrung des rohstoffbooms
8828685 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8828686 ill fit in if i misspell everything and write in all caps
8828687 you have the monarchy you have government and then you have the civil service the reason the civil service remains a non political organisation is that if the shit hits the fan like goose stepping nazi bastards you hope the civil service will turn round and go weve got it covered thats bond
8828688 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8828689 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8828690 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8828691 i will not tolerate guns or drugs on the streets of manchester my priority is to get them off the streets save lives and lock up offenders
8828692 this operation along with other recent successes shows gmps determination to deal with gun crime
8828693 this has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of firearms incidents in the area
8828694 shortly after 5am on thursday 28 august 2008 police executed a warrant at an address on keddleston avenue longsight
8828695 the company went into administration on august 7 but we were hopeful it could be sold as a going concern
8828696 the hotels director had set up a new company and had run it for three weeks as far as we knew everything was fine
8828697 but on tuesday they informed us they were not in a position to continue with the sale and the whole enterprise collapsed
8828698 those who paid by credit card should contact their credit card companies but those who paid by cash cheque or debit card have lost their money and there is no prospect of getting it back
8828699 theres no good news in this story we usually get our kicks out of saving businesses but there are none to be got here
8828700 workmen were screwing boards up to the windows and doors
8828701 i couldnt believe it even the hotel sign had been taken down
8828702 there were no staff and the phone lines were disconnected
8828703 i have planned this day in my head since i was eight and we have saved really hard we are both devastated
8828704 it is awful a real mess the hotel was fully booked by our guests people were coming from a long way away
8828705 the most important day of my life has been shattered
8828706 we were impressed with the age of the building and it was romantic
8828707 the wedding will go ahead even if i have to have it in my back garden
8828708 when manchester had a high number of asbos we did not see evidence that they were that effective an asbo will not change a neighbourhood or transform an individual
8828709 the policy of using asbos as a first resort has failed the council has been very keen on grabbing the headlines and appearing to be tough on crime
8828710 clearly the council has realised their policy has been a complete failure
8828711 reconsider whether the denial of the zoning variance imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiffs religious exercise i
8828712 plaintiff may operate a faith based school but it must do so on property that is zoned for schools
8828713 unlike zoning which is primarily concerned with uniformity of land use and stability of community growth licensing regulations are generally concerned with proper operation or with limitation or distribution or outright suppression of operation
8828714 failure to obtain a license designed to regulate an activity will not adversely affect the previously determined nonconforming status of the land upon which such activity is being conducted
8828715 nonconforming use status does not confer upon its holder an unfettered right to operate in circumvention of licensing laws
8828716 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8828717 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004
8828718 i just wanted to learn more about john f k
8828719 this was left at the lbj ranch on november 22 this was next to his bed his valet had put it there
8828720 of course he never made it to the lbj ranch
8828721 he got up on the chair and he unhooked it from above his door he had a pair of double doors at the old executive office building and he just took it down and he gave it to marty underwood
8828722 sheriff sheriff did you know that the james gang is robbin the bank
8828723 and and did you know the dalton boys are rustlin your cattle
8828724 sheriff did you know billy the kid is kidnappin your wife
8828725 holy cow what are ya goin to do about it
8828726 well im gonna stop the james gang from robbin the bank and im gonna stop the dalton boys from rustlin my cattle and im gonna stop billy the kid from takin my wife but first im gonna sing you a little tune
8828727 i respect president putins vision for russia a country at peace within its borders with its neighbors and with the world a country in which democracy and freedom and rule of law thrive
8828728 the russian people came out of the post soviet union era in a state of total chaos a great deal of freedom but it was freedom to steal from the state and president putin took over and restored a sense of order in the country and moved in a democratic way
8828729 but one thing ive found about vladimir putin is that he is consistent transparent honest and is an easy man to discuss our opportunities and problems with i know hes always telling me the truth
8828730 every time i designed something great from when we were very young he would say lets sell it it was always his idea to sell it
8828731 we believe the iphone is a great device for both personal and business use and we are dedicated to providing iphone users with mobile support to match iphones enterprise class capabilities
8828732 unavailability of wimax equipment has slowed us down from where we set out from in 2004 and 2005 we are virtually a year behind
8828733 suitable for a wide range of devices including televisions hd disc players set top boxes camcorders gaming consoles adapter products as well as other source devices
8828734 new adopter interest application breadth and emerging technology standardisation that may complement future wirelesshd development
8828735 this interest reflects a pent up need by consumers to share hd content wirelessly in a simple but secure manner
8828736 plus inqui tant lusage de ces m mes annotations pour mettre du spam sur les vid os fort trafic comme par exemple pour la vid o de cet athl te cubain qui a frapp un arbitre pendant les j o l les vid os sont supprim es au fur et mesure mais il y en a des tonnes
8828737 its certainly going to be two good games without question
8828738 we play a very good schedule without many gimmes and i think the teams excited for this weekend
8828739 you can ask me in december if we replaced his production
8828740 its always a difficult one goal scoring if were going to be a good team we need to get 40 plus goals out of 25 games youve got to get some goals but where they come from doesnt really matter
8828741 youve just got to hope that someones going to step up now and get it going theres quite a few potential scorers
8828742 we havent made the decision yet and you could go either way
8828743 a distributed antenna system on campus that will allow for better in building wireless coverage and increased capacity for voice and high speed data services
8828744 because of these infrastructure improvements we can send the 16 000 emergency text messages generated by the alert system in about three minutes
8828745 since notre dame draws students from around the nation it makes sense that most of our students use at amp t and verizon as they comprise over 85 percent of the market nationally
8828746 both verizon and at amp t are working on upgrading coverage on west quad and inside duncan hall in particular but its going to take some time
8828747 we fully support tys decision to transfer to another school
8828748 the show 2008 is special because in good charlotte it has a headliner with greater name recognition than any other performer in the history of the show
8828749 ive never heard their music but ive heard good things about them
8828750 there will always be a vocal minority that abhors the headliner you choose but the positive reactions weve received heavily outweigh the negative reactions both in number and in enthusiasm
8828751 one of the driving factors is that we are a national university and you would expect that students would want to be with family at the thanksgiving holidays and we were going all the way through wednesday before thanksgiving so its hard to get out of south bend
8828752 in the past the students were somewhat lax in putting the recycling where it should be we often found trash in the recycling bins
8828753 one problem that the recyclers were telling us was that trash items including pizza boxes and styrofoam were making their way into the recycling containers we need to do a better job of putting trash items into the trash and not in the recycling
8828754 putting them in the rooms helps students to know that recycling is available on campus
8828755 the initiative in and of itself is wonderful and i am glad that saint marys is recognizing the importance of sustainability and treating the environment well
8828756 id like to change the name on these as well
8828757 part of that is my notre dame background having gone to school here
8828758 its a real rubiks cube because if youre pursuing a 7 4 1 model youve got to find three teams arguably four that arent interested in a home and home and are willing to just be a visitor
8828759 i talked to a coach at a very good program last week
8828760 he essentially said this is the one place where he would do that because he wants his kids to experience it once not gonna do it twice
8828761 i walked around to a lot of tables and everyone had a good turnout i love this night
8828762 we had a lot of people stop and pick one up
8828763 weve had about 30 people sign up for that so far
8828764 i went because as a senior i have a little more time to do extracurricular activities
8828765 i wanted to see if there were any new clubs on campus that i didnt know about and would want to join there were a lot of clubs there that i didnt even know we had
8828766 but youre also used to having a little bit more knowledge than we do
8828767 i dont feel like if we dont if we dont get off to a good start itll be a disastrous season
8828768 but obviously you always want to start off strong and i think we have the opportunity to do that
8828769 i think theres just a real strong determination to make it better for sure and theres no doubt in my mind that we will
8828770 we have reasons to be really optimistic about this year
8828771 i think theyre both really good natural leaders for sure
8828772 croal has the ability to keep things in perspective she knows when to get on her teammates and she knows when they need a pat on the back
8828773 the only thing we know about them is how they finished last year
8828774 but we do know that they were all relatively strong teams last year
8828775 every time we play santa clara its a battle with both teams leaving everything on the field
8828776 i dont think were going to have to say too much about last year to get our team motivated
8828777 it should be a tough game because they return nine of 11 starters from last year
8828778 i dont think we can intimidate them much just because its our home field
8828779 obviously its great to have a big east rival like west virginia here for this
8828780 with all these great teams its really going to be a big event
8828781 its going to be a great weekend especially for all the fans
8828782 were just going to try to go out there and do everything we can to win it
8828783 better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference
8828784 when those in leadership give us tax increases and tell us we must also do with less have they thought about those who have always had less especially the minorities
8828785 the shared values of family work neighborhood peace and freedom
8828786 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8828787 i believe that this generation of americans today has a rendezvous with destiny
8828788 stand alone journalism almost completely self sufficient and able to reach readers directly without any unnecessary filters
8828789 it was time to escape the daily need to assume a public role to be what society and especially families expected
8828790 western media agencies only want to know about nuclear problems and al qaeda
8828791 albertan n g neydo usundaki kaz b lgesinde bulunan fosil kaplumba an n hamile oldu unu g rd k fosille mi yumurtalar laboratuvar ortam nda incelenecek bu al ma bize kaplumba a ve kaplumba agillerin evrimi ile ilgili ok nemli bilgi verecek

8828825 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8828826 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree

8828833 every time hes played for wales hes showed hes capable of facing the top world class players
8828834 hes a winner and there has been a huge improvement in his attitude since hes been at swansea he has passed every test hes been given with flying colours
8828835 i wouldnt be at all worried about williams doing it for wales and im sure that john toshack knows hes going to be a very important player in the qualifiers
8828836 hes back in full training and hopeful of being with us
8828837 there is even a chance that craig may actually be back in the premier league this weekend so we will wait and see
8828838 but we were in a lot better shape at the end of the euro 2008 qualifying campaign than we are now
8828839 to lose james danny and lewin in one fell swoop is huge for a country like ours
8828840 we have to have at least 12 points by then if we are to have a hope of doing anything
8828841 i get it youve all said it a thousand times and i can feel it stop saying it
8828842 when i go off to a disaster elsewhere i would work 12 hours a day and would usually be assigned one primary task when you are at home there is just a lot more to do and more people to keep happy
8828843 the disaster team i have here is very very good and strong and want to be involved theyre not afraid to get up in the middle of the night to go to a fire or whatever has to be taken care of
8828844 the people in this community are so generous and really stepped up
8828845 the red cross may have led the way but it was definitely a community effort
8828846 we know things have not changed a whole lot since 1962
8828847 now that we have new technology they are able to get better information
8828848 any work we do for the feasibility study reduces the amount well actually have to pay
8828849 its a major change for the army corps of engineers
8828850 we know if you store it slow it down then that will reduce the kinds of physical controls like flood walls you might need to have
8828851 eye on the ball to make sure we dont lose track of budget deadlines
8828852 theres been increased flooding across the country and a lot more people are now trying to put projects in place theres a backlog of projects on the books
8828853 this is our project and its very important to everyone that we get this thing done
8828854 honestly because we are laser focused on one item is how were able to bring things along
8828855 discuss any issues and were prepared to make any conforming changes to the relationship if necessary
8828856 the intentions of the greaterfindlay and port authority boards were to create a collaborative relationship that would further advance the economic development opportunities between the public and private sectors
8828857 phillips would have been a welcomed addition to our community we regret his decision as we feel his background and experience would have provided tremendous leadership in moving the community forward
8828858 im not sure that schulman is never going to come

8828866 i know that president bush has made mistakes but the ridiculous partisan politics with elected officials stalling on the kinds of policies that would really help the country because they dont want it to happen on
8828867 mark addis is not going to be sacked and daniel leesong is not going to be shoe horned into the head of department of economic development
8828868 shes got an infection and basically shes on an antibiotic drip
8828869 they are just monitoring her and she needs full rest and that is the opportunity they are giving her
8828870 ive spoken to her and shes in good spirits but she has to rest
8828871 its certainly a rare event but no one can discount these things happening
8828872 what we are trying to do is trying to find out what mechanism could have caused this so we can put into place some precautionary measures
8828873 there is nothing at this stage the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this because we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8828874 we dont really understand at this stage what the failure mechanism of the cylinder is but it is clear the rupture in the fuselage has been caused by the failure of this number four cylinder
8828875 looking at the next three months the chances of exceeding median rainfall are about 50 50
8828876 theres no strong shift in odds over most of queensland and the northern territory in fact over most of eastern australia
8828877 there are no indicators that its going to be wetter than normal seasons but on the flip side theres no indicator either that itll be drier but it does look to be warmer
8828878 we do have higher probabilities of exceeding both overnight and daytime temperatures particularly in the the north
8828879 ive been awaiting 20 minutes mon the hurricane is a coming mon
8828880 im a sorry you have to wait but i was here first a mon
8828881 i dont think that anyone in tasmania could place an accusation at the feet of this government over recent years of not supporting the pulp mill and not doing enough to get this project over the line and i would not accept any of that blame
8828882 this is a moment in time for tasmania s forests
8828883 we now have an opportunity to reassess how we use our forests and particularly to move forward and use our tasmania s forests for the magnificent carbon stores they are and use them to help solve the crisis of climate change
8828884 it is unfortunate that we have to create a business environment that does not look as though we are open for business due to a premier who looks very lukewarm on a 2 billion project
8828885 at this point we have nothing planned nothing is confirmed
8828886 people want to fight i dont know what it is they go out there and they want to fight
8828887 more times than not an officers presence deters crimes from occurring
8828888 we broke them up and got them out of there
8828889 you dont have to know as much about depth of field and all that
8828890 you can take a good photo now with a 100 200 camera but its still about having a good eye too
8828891 its busy but its good its something you dont see too often its not the blanchard river sometimes you have to go elsewhere to get the good picture
8828892 even with video and everything when it all falls together boy thats what people remember like when people think of 9 11 they remember the firemen planting the flag

8828909 you paid 50 for a massage and you received a massage is that correct

8828914 we never really got caught up from the initial flooding
8828915 the biggest difference was the heat it was so mild that our guys were able to get more work in and more fitness
8828916 this is just the first phase of our season the tournament phase which normally you would think comes at the end but we have four tournaments on four different weekends our goal is simply to win and prepare our self for conference play
8828917 i love your shows theyre a great guilty pleasure of mine
8828918 his chief of staff took the phone call and was informed by inpex they had made their decision on the site of the gas project that they were developing
8828919 it is my firm understanding that decision was to locate the plant in darwin
8828920 i was told that they are still determining their position and that was the advice i got on august the 21st and no i havent been told anything different

8828925 rumored girlfriend of joe jonas taylor swift watching the jonas brothers concert in camden n
8828926 not only was joes gal pal country crooner taylor swift at their show last night but sources tell us that nick jonas rumored girlfriend selena gomez was also at the jonas brothers concert in camden n j on wednesday night
8828927 and one reason we are so excited about it is because there is very little overlap between the two companies
8828928 our office is dedicated to making sure people do what theyre supposed to do especially when they are trusted with public funds
8828929 the evidence would show that each and every month during that time period the defendants total gross receipts for sales made at rocktown grill were well in excess of what he was reporting to either abc or commissioner of revenue
8828930 coes own bank records would show that on at least 75 different days during the 10 month period the amount of money in coes business account was lower oftentimes significantly lower than the amount that he should have been holding in his account in trust for the city
8828931 during this time coe used the citys funds as his own and at no time made any attempt to correct the deficiencies or repay the funds owed

8828933 were still jumping up a division going to the acc
8828934 its still acc football its one of the top tier divisions in the country you would think duke would come into our league and do very well if they played in the caa be one of the top three teams
8828935 theres a big difference i would think duke would admit theres a big difference playing duke than playing clemson or virginia tech its just a different deal
8828936 im sure there will be the smell of christmas morning down there at duke
8828937 the only time duke has won in the last 30 years is when steve spurrier was throwing the ball every down im sure they feel like theyve hired a guy to be the next steve spurrier on paper its a great hire
8828938 anywhere you are where theres upwards of 20 000 people screaming at you you get that intensity that excitement
8828939 its the largest stadium well play in its an exciting atmosphere for young guys its an eye opening experience playing big time college football
8828940 as long as we come out ready to play for all four quarters we know we have a chance to win
8828941 we have duke first and thats all were worried about were not looking at app state were not looking at umass were not looking at richmond its the game thats in front of us
8828942 theres a lot of choices and its all pretty much good
8828943 we try to make sure we stay on top of the trends
8828944 its a shock for them at first but after we explain the reasons behind it theyre fine with it
8828945 im working with them a little bit differently and not being afraid to try things that have never been tried before at page county im sort of trying to go out of the box with my thinking and if youre going to play those type people you have to go out of the box i think
8828946 that was one thing that everybody wanted to do was get the ball in the air a lot more so going to the spread its kind of a given youve got to do that everybody was real excited about it
8828947 the blockings a whole lot simpler to keep up with
8828948 i think well be all right because we have a lot of fast receivers we can really throw the ball you dont have a certain gap to block to because your backs are reading instead of aiming for a certain gap
8828949 i think we have one of the hardest districts in the state of virginia for single a
8828950 you definitely find out how good you are when you play teams like gap and riverheads
8828951 thats something that riverheads robert casto and stonewall jackson coach dick krol and gaps rob maxwell have done a great job of with their kids
8828952 they dont think that theyre going to lose they dont think for any minute that theyre not going to be in the playoffs year in and year out i think its pretty much a mindset thats accepted within their program
8828953 he certainly has our support and we think its the right decision for him
8828954 this is not a simple thing i think we have a good team here and he certainly would have helped
8828955 but i dont think theres great value in someone not being in preseason workouts not being in preseason practice then missing the first eight games and trying to play and its not just the games but all the team bonding and those things it wouldnt be a great experience for a freshman to come in in january and try to work into the rotation
8828956 i just want to get him here as soon as possible
8828957 get him acclimated to the school to his teammates and all of those things
8828958 but in that way this could be a tremendous blessing in disguise for him
8828959 we threw some wrinkles in there some different things that were going to try to exploit use some our people a little differently and see if we can generate some positive offense against this really quick defense
8828960 i think their defense impresses me up front it looks like they have a strong defensive line and pretty good linebackers the secondarys quick not real big but quick they have a fullback that has power and their quarterback can throw the ball real well
8828961 we were very similar in fact to broadway we were a tight i pro i type team with a little option in there like they do we were more like that but weve committed to the spread now thats kind of the soup du jour now our kids like it and we feel like weve got the personnel for it
8828962 i think theyve got about 25 seniors on the roster speaking with monroe coach tom hoffman i think that they only won two ballgames last year but hes really expecting them to be a lot better this year and they look like theyre much improved on film so were going to have our hands full well just worry about ourselves and take care of the football and see what happens
8828963 itll be a lot different from last saturday night when we had all of our fans there in the stands to look at and make a lot of noise
8828964 itll be a different atmosphere but i know william monroes going to be real fired up and excited and ive been telling my kids weve got to mach their intensity
8828965 i really do think they enjoy going up and playing on a saturday
8828966 its like a college atmosphere weve had a good time and for the past few years weve been fortunate to be able to win but theyve been very very close games
8828967 the main reason its happening now is because of barack himself
8828968 hes been able to reach out to a lot of people
8828969 it made me feel young again like i did in the 60s when i wanted to change the world
8828970 its the inspiration we expect from him maybe a little more hard hitting than people expected but rightfully so
8828971 we are adjusting our rates to reflect a general reduction in prices that has occurred in the energy markets
8828972 i have been with the mccain campaign for the past year
8828973 if you work that hard for a guy to get the nomination you want to see him get it
8828974 it will be a lot of fun to see what the convention is all about
8828975 his story is compelling hes a fearless legislator hes a leader
8828976 immigration of families with large numbers of children and low incomes would move the numbers in the direction we are seeing
8828977 i dont know any of you ever check out the forums on icanhazcheesburger theres the future
8828978 im sorry but what does this mean 250 gigs doesnt seem like much to me and i dont even really to

8828987 sono molto molto felice dice con un tono di voce quasi commosso in quella che la sua prima dichiarazione ufficiale dopo che di nuovo un giocatore del milan ci speravo da tanto tempo di potere tornare e pensavo speravo che questa trattativa potesse concludersi positivamente
8828988 tutti sapevano che il mio desiderio era tornare al milan non ne ho mai fatto mistero con le persone che mi sono state vicine ma non per questo volevo mancare di rispetto al chelsea alla sua dirigenza e al suo presidente speravo solo che alla fine le cose si mettessero per il meglio non solo per me ma per tutti
8828989 s ci sono state tante complicazioni ammette lex pallone doro in rossonero ma oggi mi sento come se avessi vinto la champions league sto bene molto bene e sono pronto a ricominciare immediatamente
8828990 i told our coaches dont worry about it just keep calling the game
8828991 i said lets just keep running the ball because we might not see the ball if we throw it
8828992 fredie gave us what we expected he was here all year last year it was also good to see the young guys step up its always a question mark when youve never been out here before on a friday night but handy did a great job
8828993 we wanted to set the tone and keep it going through the whole season this is a new oak ridge and a new stadium
8828994 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated
8828995 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8828996 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8828997 year after year the continued success of the mens final four demonstrates it is one of americas great events
8828998 the support from our corporate champions and corporate partners for the mens final four and all 88 ncaa championships is strong and growing
8828999 im really happy i know all the kids hopefully i can build on what weve started
8829000 shes had a very successful jv program shes taught the skills well and been a loyal member of our staff she has all the qualities to take over the program
8829001 just a great softball mind she teaches the game very well and i think shell make a good coach she did a good job for me i missed her when she left
8829002 i like small ball and i like situational stuff raines said
8829003 im big on defense and i think we have the potential to have a really good year like we did last year
8829004 four preseason games are one of those things you just have to deal with
8829005 for the players especially the ones that have played year in and year out its obviously more difficult for them we all know that its a necessary evil and we have no problem doing it
8829006 weve got some difficult decisions to make on about 10 players
8829007 for instance if we keep 10 defensive linemen we might keep nine defensive backs if we keep 10 defensive backs we might keep nine defensive linemen
8829008 depth at linebacker is a concern because of injuries two of them rookie xavier adibi and veteran chaun thompson were non existent in preseason
8829009 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8829010 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8829011 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8829012 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8829013 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8829014 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8829015 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8829016 one under was a good score today with the wind and the soft greens
8829017 this was ok one over is by no means out of this tournament
8829018 famous daddy blogger to be away from laptop for a decade
8829019 i cant see a single candidate in the whole of manasagangotri who can take the place of kuvempu we should tell our chancellor to enlarge the scope of our search
8829020 why cant we look around and shortlist some candidates from our neighboring states
8829021 we cant take anybody from tamil nadu they are against kannada getting classical language status and naturally we wont touch anybody from there moreover if rains fail next year and tamil nadu demands its pounds of flesh er its tmc of cauvery water a vc of tamil origin will be a security risk in our campus any professor from kerala will be a leftist and we cant have karl marx going about as vc andhra pradesh is a strict no no after the hungama created by the nomination of a telugu member during governors rule
8829022 why dont we zero in on somebody from industry somebody who has some prior teaching experience
8829023 we just cant sell off our ideals to a fellow who is always looking at the bottomline most of them are reverse engineers or body shoppers who serve western countries even if a starting software engineer gets 3 to 4 times our salary can there be any pride in that sort of work he might have been a teacher once but by now he would have thrown his principles out of the window industry is out
8829024 what about a professor from a foreign university who has made a name in his field somebody from mysore itself may want to come back
8829025 why should we fall back on someone who ran away years ago to earn a few dollars more clearly he had no interest to serve his country like the rest of us we will lose self respect if we now call him moreover he will be an insufferable snooty snob with a matching funny accent it will only harm our great university and put us back by several years
8829026 why dont we look at our own legislative assembly after all our prime minister himself taught at london school of economics who has done very well of late as prime minister we could ask our cm to suggest somebody suitable from vidhana soudha
8829027 we should do no such thing first our cm will think we are useless and will dissolve the committee i dont want to lose this job second he may suggest some brahmin which our senate is against third even if he suggests a non brahmin say somebody from the schedules castes and scheduled tribes most of our teaching staff will object to it even if the clerical staff will be delighted we will be opening a pandora s box of caste which we should avoid at any cost
8829028 even if we select someone meeting all the criteria our chancellor is sure to reject our choice so lets go slow on this and take our own sweet time a term is for five years we have an acting vc there is no fixed term for an acting vc we should let sleeping dogs lie no point in speeding up things unnecessarily
8829029 god save a university which cant find itself a vc
8829030 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify what could have been done to prevent this because we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8829031 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8829032 you never know they can find you wherever you are
8829033 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
8829034 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world
8829035 i am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things

8829041 we have guys here who are sophomores and juniors who havent caught a lot of balls
8829042 so when you talk about freshmen coming in some of those guys have eight fewer catches than guys who have been here a year or two
8829043 what we have been able to see of him is that he is a really great athlete
8829044 hes got great feet and has the ability to make plays
8829045 after redshirting his freshman season tarrant played in seven games last season where he gained 94 yards on 12 carries
8829046 i want to go out and compete and at the end of the year everything works itself out
8829047 im throwing the ball well but theres been a lot of games this year i thought i threw the ball well and came up empty obviously the last two games ive thrown the ball pretty good and kept them off balance
8829048 these last two starts have really been terrific and im hoping thats the real brandon backe we see
8829049 he did the same thing here last time out and attacked the zone with his fastball and went to his off speed stuff when he needed to he was really good
8829050 im looking at eight innings or a complete game going into the seventh inning
8829051 im not trying to get ahead of myself but its certainly possible to get two outs and have all the stuff happen a ball that goes halfway to third and i would have had to have made a great play it starts from there
8829052 they had a triple that gets in the nook of the crawford boxes and i walk a guy adam rosales who hasnt established himself in the league and here you go im more frustrated i didnt last longer than 62 3
8829053 if there is a difference its early on in the season i felt good and i busted up my thumb and it took a little bit to get my timing going since the middle to end of may thats when i started feeling comfortable at the plate
8829054 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8829055 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight
8829056 im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8829057 it is like at times they absolutely are thinking each others thoughts
8829058 if you would have told us four years ago that we could be the ncaa record holder for touchdowns by a duo i would have laughed at you
8829059 that just seems ridiculous it really has surprised me we just didnt think this is where wed be
8829060 we were completing so many passes that we were like hey coach maybe we should run this
8829061 right then i made some catches to where even i was saying wow and chase was throwing balls where he was thinking to himself wow from there the confidence started sinking in we saw that just playing scout team got us a closer bond
8829062 i know that when youre a young quarterback like clement was you tend to look for a particular guy a little bit more just like colt did early with us
8829063 i see that when i see clement scramble around he knows where to find his guy dillard
8829064 when we first got in the spread he was the only one i had thrown a lot of routes to so he was the only one i could really trust to know that hes going to be where i need him to be early on i knew who he was as a receiver and how he played so it was a lot easier for me to throw it to him and trust him
8829065 theyre a great example to people of when the underdogs come up and do something
8829066 for two guys from rice to come together and they can set the all time record thats something that i think will be a great inspiration to people in college and high school forever
8829067 with the win against guatemala we have put ourselves in a good situation at the start of the semifinal round i was very pleased with the way our team stuck together in a difficult environment
8829068 we need to have that same type of effort in the matches against cuba and trinidad andtobago
8829069 they brought in new guys and ive been here awhile
8829070 im not sure if they are getting tired of me or not but i just tried to let them know nah you cant be tired of me
8829071 im not surprised at the way petey has bounced back
8829072 i expect that from him he may not always play as well as he can but he doesnt let it get him down and he keeps working hard he took a lot of heat last year but it wasnt the first time id seen him bounce back before hes had a great camp and preseason and im so happy for him
8829073 he worked through some hard hard times that sent him the other way
8829074 and now hes battling back and playing his tail off

8829084 our family has been in montana forever five generations on my mothers side its one of the most open minded places we judge a person by who you are as a person
8829085 if youre decent and you treat people with respect youll get the same back nine times out of 10 and thats true of most places its true theres not a lot of african americans black people in montana but people judge you as a person not only if youre black but if youre different in one way or another
8829086 this could happen only in america you dont have to be a kennedy a bush or a clinton some people say he shoots too high shoots too far look at what hes already accomplished we are good people we are the land of opportunity
8829087 you take a step back and say look at this i think it has to excite you as an american if he can get out who he is get his story out he can win montana
8829088 this is a historic time for montana i cant remember a more critical time its deadly serious

8829093 im thinking about how powerful it feels to have all of these women the largest number of women in a national convention im a hillary supporter still with all of my heart im so proud of her shes a world class act and im ready to go home and work my heart out for obama
8829094 i think all week it was just building in enthusiasm to a crescendo

8829096 americans we can do everything if we put our minds to it

8829120 as long as the price is not creating a negative the bad guys can use dirty virtual money because sales of goods and services orchestrated by a spam campaign will clear their funds
8829121 unfortunately a solution for raising the cost of virtual mail can only work as long as normal law abiding players happily accept such a raise
8829122 they gave us a package of work that we would size spec analyse and then build
8829123 it made a difference in the tender process for a project of this scale to have a fixed price
8829124 we hear so much about these types of projects going over budget
8829125 we built in some costs so there has been an allowance for the additional cost of a more interative development style
8829126 we didnt dictate how the solution should be executed it was up to sydney waters discretion
8829127 if wed gone in and said x amount of work has to go offshore the working dynamic with sydney water might have been different
8829128 in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8829129 the ultimate benefits of solid state will require software management and systems capabilities
8829130 ibm is integrating this technology with systems and applications so that companies can achieve real business value from solid state disk quicksilver is a significant step forward in this comprehensive systems strategy
8829131 this is not about replacing todays hard disk drive with a new form factor this is about having a complete end to end systems approach
8829132 and thats not something emc hp or sun can match
8829133 in terms of an inspirational leader steve jobs is really the best ive ever met
8829134 hes got a belief in the excellence of products hes able to communicate that
8829135 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8829136 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8829137 clearly gdp positions have come down from six months ago
8829138 our statement has been cautionary in terms of economic change these economic conditions can signal potential problems going forward but we havent experienced any problems yet
8829139 weve won quite a few government panel contracts that have driven that growth and weve had quite a lot of general commercial business as well
8829140 in terms of aggressiveness i think weve taken quite a bold step in introducing these products
8829141 what were doing now as always when customers have cost concerns is stress the importance of scalability and i think thats why weve been so successful in the enterprise space
8829142 a few months back after we announced our upcoming release of sal or the 120 days of sodom we received a note from a viewer asking us which version of the film we would be releasing noting that a 2001 british film institute bfi release featured a brief scene not contained in the original criterion dvd dealing with various versions of a film is a common situation for us and as a producer its one of the first issues i address the scene in question occurs at the end of the wedding sequence approximately forty four minutes into the film in the criterion master the scene cuts just after the magistrate shuffles the wedding guests out the door and down the stairs in the 2001 bfi release this scene extends to include the magistrate reading a short poem
8829143 how much provocation can one speaker pack into just 54 minutes in this recording of a talk given at uc berkeley on april 26 1968 the then newly hired film critic for the new yorker pauline kael goes a great distance toward answering that question as she brutalizes underground cinema arthur penn and the institutional imperatives of mass market film criticism and those are but three of the targets upon which she opens fire
8829144 on frenzy everywhere i look theres a darkness alfred hitchcocks darkest joke is also one of his grandest an iconic wrong man thriller given a contemporary viciousness and pumped up to kafkaesque levels of persecution and jon finch is in his own way the perfect protagonist so beaten down by life that a murder rap is just another thing for him to impotently defy but heres the thing while a good deal of the film especially the ride in the potato truck is sick squirmy fun theres something that most people miss or at least dont feel like discussing hitchcock beats michael haneke to the punch a good 25 years prior to the latters ascendancy in indicting his audience for what theyre not walking out on
8829145 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8829146 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8829150 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8829151 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8829152 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8829153 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8829154 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8829155 what he should not do is what he will be criticized for not doing give a detailed policy speech this is not the place for that
8829156 its like being at a drive in movie the lights are dim the breezes cool considering this is a story told over and over again to the party faithful the rapt attention the audience is paying to the video is striking
8829157 the question that arose was how the procedure could be it seems as if the thai people are getting fed up with the corruption that is so rife in their government
8829158 if you dont want to get contacted if somebody wins then dont put your name in it that was just such a girl thing to do wimp
8829159 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8829160 an excellent example of a group blog a true community of like minded but highly individual writers topics range from the state of christian publishing to craft issues to lyrical meditations on writing as a spiritual discipline
8829161 ha sido muy frustrante porque s que puedo jugar mucho mejor
8829162 cre muchas opciones de ganar durante el partido y me siento frustrada por haberlas perdido pero quiero ser positiva porque esta vez ya no he sentido molestias por la lesi n y eso me motiva mucho para salir pronto a la cancha y seguir mejorando
8829163 nunca antes la hab a visto jugar y no sab a que esperar ella ha servido muy bien y muy fuerte y aunque me esforc no tuve opci n comet muchos errores en el partido y fue por falta de pr ctica ya que ltimamente he hechos muchos viajes
8829164 he hecho un partido correcto y estoy feliz de estar en tercera ronda en el primer set he jugado bien pegando buenos golpes de derecha en el segundo l ha entrado un poco m s en juego y en le tercero ha empezado a jugar mejor pero lo importante es que con el 3 0 en contra he sabido reaccionar a tiempo para ganarlo

8829168 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do
8829169 the leader of the pad sondhi limthongkul has told me that the entire political system needs to be changed and says that perhaps thailand isnt ready for full democracy because of the endemic corruption
8829170 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney

8829172 a land once divided by poverty and shame will now be united to praise gods name for these are the faces of the christ who died to now bring redemption to the lost in doubt with a heart of compassion and the purest flame our hearts will burn brighter through aids and pain for the lost and forgotten they surely will rise to awaken a nation to the sovereign sound we have seen we have heard we have felt a call thats greater than our yearn we reach out with gods touch to heal a land thats known no greater love if love is poor then you are with them if grace is shame then you are with them if faith breeds pain then you are with them and i will respond i will respond as the tears of the widow they fall to the ground she embraces the orphan who now is found for jesus has given his hands and feet to reach to this nation and to those in need

8829213 the 911 center does a very good job at dispatching the closest available unit thats often based on our technology
8829214 the wichita fire department w f d continues to be increasingly concerned about the dispatching issues associated with sedgwick countys new 911 system the problems are overwhelmingly the result of the cad system and software not the users the w f d initiated daily cad reports several months ago in an effort to promptly resolve the issue a fully operating 911 system is critical to helping the w f d meet public safety needs the fire department has been and will continue to work with sedgwick county for a quick resolution
8829215 incorrect apparatus being dispatched incorrect stations being alerted and correct stations not being alerted
8829216 again experiencing severe problems with cad recommendations for alarm response
8829217 no correction has been implemented for the problem of cad selecting the wrong apparatus to be dispatched so you will still see errors
8829218 to have a list of defects like that doesnt surprise me
8829219 we believe that the system is meeting the citys expectations
8829220 rededication of our efforts in resolving cad and 911 system issues
8829221 newton offers a lot of really fantastic festivals throughout the year and there are a great lot of people in this community we just dont have the hotel rooms to service everyone
8829222 youre always in competition with those cities and towns next to you
8829223 so yes we are in competition with the north end of wichita
8829224 we have no facility large enough to seat 500 people for a banquet
8829225 well i dont know if i like it so much because well you know its nice and peaceful around here and having all those people around here i dont know you know
8829226 we dont anticipate that this will be something that just city of newton residents will utilize
8829227 hace mucho no iba a un concierto donde la gente estuviera tan dispuesta a escuchar m sica diferente
8829228 the uk and ireland are highly attractive destinations for illegal immigrants and organised crime oc groups who facilitate illegal immigration
8829229 both countries are favourite destinations because of a flourishing economy and consequent demand for workers particularly in low skilled sectors and the image of easy access to health welfare and education systems
8829230 nigerian oc groups for generations present in amongst others the uk and the netherlands and responsible for various forms of fraud are now also discovered in ireland
8829231 this allows the use of genuine documents instead of falsified documents to apply for access to a school recently also bogus schools established by the oc group themselves help in obtaining the visa applications by providing the necessary documents
8829232 established irish oc groups are starting to bypass the criminal hubs and becoming active in the source countries
8829233 the incident was witnessed by several young children who were on their way to school at the time as you can imagine a number of them were very traumatised by what they saw we have been in contact with the hse and asked them to provide counselling to the children and a neighbour
8829234 we are currently assessing these results and any impact they may have on the airline
8829235 staff at aer lingus have delivered on substantial cost saving measures since 2001 and continue to play an instrumental role in the continuing success of the company
8829236 its fair to say the majority of doctors lack confidence in the change process and those who were willing to embrace it have been less than impressed at the speed at which results are being achieved
8829237 these findings indicate that properties inherent in normal cells are sufficient for negotiating a significant portion of the metastatic cascade
8829238 the finding that metastatic disease can arise from untransformed mammary cells in the circulation refines our conception of cancer progression and suggests that each step in the metastatic cascade should be examined to establish its functional requirements including those performed by normal cells
8829239 our view is that there is a strong underlying demand for housing the difficulty for consumers is in securing mortgage finance
8829240 it is not possible to anticipate accurately when this situation will reverse however there is little doubt that there continues to be a demand for a significantly higher level of homes in ireland than current production levels particularly in our target market of first time buyers of houses as opposed to apartments
8829241 in recent weeks several builders have reported land write downs and once off restructuring costs in response to the depressed trading environment
8829242 it was inevitable that mcinerney would have to respond in the same manner
8829243 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8829244 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8829245 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8829246 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8829247 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8829248 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8829249 increased visibility across both the pub and off trade has resulted in guinness increasing its market share of the long alcohol drink market on the island of ireland and one in four of all long alcohol drinks consumed in ireland is a guinness
8829250 we have written to 69 secondary schools in the mid west letting them know about our services and we only got responses from five of these schools in the 22 years we have been in the mid west we have been only asked once to go into a secondary school to do a workshop on our helplines and that school was in limerick i am not surprised at the lack of response from schools given their ethos around religion
8829251 teachers are still ill equipped to talk about gay and lesbian identity they can talk about inclusion and racism but not about sexuality it is time to open up now particularly when the safety of students is at risk

8829261 the referee reported that the player struck with the hand the referees have been instructed to report in the language of the rule book and not to use their own language in this case joe mcquillan did that but it seems as if it was decided the ruling for a four week suspension was too severe
8829262 we never enter into disciplinary decisions it is up to the disciplinary committees what they do the referee did his job in this instance and he cant do any more he reported correctly that the player struck with his hand but it does make things difficult in the future in terms of referees reports
8829263 in soccer if you raise your hand you are gone and everybody is quite clear on that he commented
8829264 it was silly of the cork player to slap omahony on the face i dont think we need to change we just need to get the message out that you dont raise your hand but having said that the chc has overruled it
8829265 i would hope that it wouldnt undermine referees especially young referees speaking for myself what happens in committee rooms has no bearing on how i referee a game i would always be telling young referees that its none of their business either their job is to do whats asked on the football pitch to the best of their ability and meet their responsibility
8829266 he understands the game and he has that demeanour thats required this decision wont affect him unduly

8829293 employees carrying out their job duties should have the full faith and protection of the city behind them however when an ethics violation occurs no matter how well intentioned the employee may have been the fine should not be passed along to taxpayers
8829294 our city has a strong reputation for transparency and openness in government we have extremely strong ethics and elections laws but i had no idea we had such a gaping loophole that would allow public officials to use taxpayer money to pay a penalty imposed by the ethics commission we will quickly close that loophole
8829295 the public should not have to pay the fines of public officials who violate our ethics laws we need to make it clear that all public officials will be responsible for their actions
8829296 the council takes its responsibility as stewards of the public trust very seriously and im pleased to make local government more accountable by closing this loophole this change is a clear demonstration of the city councils integrity and commitment to uphold that trust

8829358 but the weirdest thing was the fact that a statement in the journal was most of the time split
8829359 one half of the sentence would be on page 124 for example while the second half would be way back on page 7

8829461 de ninguna manera una ley se puede plagiar porque no tiene derecho de autor de nadie y yo te puedo asegurar que todas leyes que tiene el congreso del estado son leyes que se han bajado a nivel federal y que finalmente pueden servir de referencia de otros estados porque otros estados pueden ir m s adelantados en un marco jur dico de acuerdo a una realidad propia particular y nosotros podemos adoptar un marco jur dico

8829515 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8829516 this race was never about me it was about you and whats happening all across america change doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
8829517 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8829518 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8829519 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8829520 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so

8829563 he would have to have a dramatic setback right now every step weve taken has been good
8829564 he wanted to see how loose hed be after the wait in the locker room that type of thing
8829565 we had an exercise bike out there for him but i think hes pretty happy with how the routine went

8829578 no hay discusi n sobre la irracionalidad de esta matanza inenarrable pero qu significa la exigencia de tranquilidad y justicia sobre la violencia acrecentada de la delincuencia no hay duda debe frenarse con la acci n de la justicia que impida el narcotr fico los polic as involucrados los empresarios y pol ticos c mplices etc tera pero esto se ha dicho en demas a y ni modo no ha pasado nada por eso creo que uno de los pasos siguientes al lado de las acciones del poder judicial es un debate nacional de primer orden sobre la estructura de la impunidad y creo que al lado de la cumbre de seguridad debe darse de varias maneras la cumbre alternativa donde las sociedades discutan desde su experiencia sobre su porvenir inmediato

8829586 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
8829587 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
8829588 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
8829589 this wasnt a liberal speech at all it was a deeply centrist speech
8829590 hold the camera out in front of us and shoot
8829591 my understanding is their interpretation of scripture is that to immunize would be to show a lack of faith in gods ability to protect them and therefore they choose not to do that

8829594 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
8829595 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
8829596 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
8829597 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
8829598 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
8829599 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
8829600 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
8829601 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
8829602 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
8829603 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
8829604 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
8829605 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
8829606 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
8829607 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
8829608 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
8829609 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
8829610 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
8829611 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
8829612 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
8829613 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8829614 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
8829615 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
8829616 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
8829617 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
8829618 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
8829619 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
8829620 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
8829621 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
8829622 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
8829623 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
8829624 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
8829625 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
8829626 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
8829627 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
8829628 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
8829629 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
8829630 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
8829631 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
8829632 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
8829633 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
8829634 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
8829635 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
8829636 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
8829637 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
8829638 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
8829639 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
8829640 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
8829641 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
8829642 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
8829643 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
8829644 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
8829645 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
8829646 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
8829647 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice

8829863 lihat saja sampai kini kasus tebang liar masih meraja lela penyelundupan dan pencurian ikan masih marak terjadi
8829864 salah satu solusi yang paling masuk akal dalam mengatasi persoalan peratasan yakni segera membentuk provinsi kalimantan utara kaltara yang terpisah dari kaltim kalimantan timur untuk mengejar berbagai ketertinggal ekonomi dan pembangunan di kawasan perbatasan jadi pendekatanya bukan security approach namun prosperity approach
8829865 persoalan berat di perbatasan yakni penjarahan hutan penambangan tanpa izin pencurian ikan penyelundupan tki ilegal sampai ancaman kehilangan teritorial jadi masalah klasik yang tidak bisa dituntaskan oleh pemerintah
8829866 apabila kaltara yang sebagian wilayahnya berbatasan dengan malaysia timur itu dijadikan provinsi maka otomatis dibentuk sejumlah instansi badan dan kantor provinsi misalnya kejati korem dan polda sehingga penanganan berbagai tindakan merugikan negara lebih fokus dan intensif

8829890 although the idea that instrumental learning can occur subconsciously has been around for nearly a century it had not been unequivocally demonstrated now a new study published by cell press in the august 28 issue of the journal neuron used sophisticated perceptual masking computational modeling and neuroimaging to show that instrumental learning can occur in the human brain without conscious processing of contextual cues

8829898 i think we used him in the right spot tonight and dan offensive coordinator dan henning did a nice job of trying to get him the ball
8829899 but ernest did a nice job that exact route that little stutter post that he ran out there we worked on in practice and he ran it great in practice he ran it great out there tonight and we were able to put it in his body thats kind of what i was talking about during the week he made two catches today where he was kind of able to body the defender up a little bit and use his hands a little bit and that was nice to see
8829900 i never had no doubt im not worried about what the outside sources say the coaches know what they brought me in here for the coaches know what im capable of and today it just finally paid dividends
8829901 im starting to get my health and confidence up again and i think i can make a difference all over the field whether its third down or whether its me stretching the field im eager to show the coaches what i can do
8829902 i think we finally woke up i thought henne did a nice job of managing the thing here at the end
8829903 youve got to put those bad plays away and you cant let them hinder you or that will hinder your play
8829904 i have a short memory and once it goes in youre out of that play and move on to the next play last week i didnt feel i had a good performance and we started out slow but we got 14 points on the board and i was happy about that
8829905 i thought they put a lot of pressure on the passer and we didnt really do much in this game that way it was really just our edge rushers
8829906 but i thought they did a nice job getting up the field i noticed the pressure early in the game and we were able to get to the quarterback a few times force some balls out get some turnovers that way and that was really important for us
8829907 i felt pretty good coming into the game today and to get that run and just to be in the open field and just kind of see how i was going to react i think that was a good opportunity
8829908 i feel good i put everything i had out there on the field as best as i could
8829909 if they choose me to be on the team then i know it was good enough and if not then i know that i did my best out there and hopefully another team will say come join us but youve got to go out there and play as hard as you possibly can and lay it on the line and let them make the decisions they have to make
8829910 this defense is all about read and react and it gives me a chance to look at what the offense is doing and recognize their formations instead of making a call here or there when someones moving
8829911 it does make you fly around a little faster and as far as my spot on the roster i just knew either way it went it was never in my control the only thing that i could control was going out on the practice field each day and just hammering away at it getting better thats exactly what i wanted to do was go out there and get better each day
8829912 i believe this is going to be a tough race

8829966 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8829967 my message to them is first of all to open their minds they were born to muslim families this is how they got islam and this is just like any other religion like growing up in a christian family or growing up in a jewish family so my point is that i want those people to open their eyes their minds to start to understand and imagine that they werent born for a muslim family and use their minds why did god give them minds open their hearts read the bible study their religion i want to open the gate for them i want them to be free they will find a good life on earth just by following god and theyre also going to guarantee the other life

8829983 so by what the lord said in this verse do you think it would be profitable unto the devil if he could lie about and make people doubt gods word i believe the answer is yes

8829987 the christian practice of growing old the witness of scripture
8829988 concerning when life begins a particular aggregate of hereditary tendencies genes and chromosomes is first assembled at the moment of fertilization when an ovum egg is invaded by a sperm cell
8829989 by this definition a new composite individual is started at the moment of fertilization however to survive this individual needs a very specialized environment for nine months just as it requires sustained care for an indefinite period after birth but from the moment of union of the germ cells there is under normal development a living definite going concern to interrupt a pregnancy at any stage is like cutting the link of a chain the chain is broken no matter where the link is cut naturally the earlier a pregnancy is interrupted the easier it is technically the less the physical objective encounter to deny a truth should not be made a basis for legalizing abortion
8829990 to begin with scientifically something very radical occurs between the processes of gametogenesis and fertilization the change from a simple part of one human being i
8829991 this new single cell human being immediately produces specifically human proteins and enzymes not carrot or frog enzymes and proteins and genetically directs his her own growth and development in fact this genetic growth and development has been proven not to be directed by the mother finally this new human being the single cell human zygote is biologically an individual a living organism an individual member of the human species
8829992 w e begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes which will
8829993 that this definition when human life begins has been expounded since prior to roe vs
8829994 most scientific knowledge concerning human identity and human development prior to birth was based solely upon gross morphological observations and biochemical studies over the past twenty years there have been extraordinary scientific medical and technological advances and discoveries which expose the rather rudimentary level of knowledge and ignorance of science errors of fact and judgment concerning past scientific understanding of the childs existence as a human being the childs early development and ability to react to the childs environment and feel pain prior to birth the new techniques developed through the exploding revolution over the past twenty years permits scientists to observe human existence and development at a molecular level which is applicable in determining genetic uniqueness genetic diseases and related information through the analysis of human genes well in advance of the old gross anatomical observation
8829995 there can no longer any doubt that each human being is totally unique from the very beginning of his or her life at fertilization
8829996 a human being at an embryonic age and that human being at an adult age are naturally the same the biological differences are due only to the differences in maturity changes in methylation of cytosine demonstrate that the human being is fully programmed for human growth and development for his or her entire life at the one cell age
8829997 it is generally accepted in medical circles that a fetus or embryo is a separate human being because abortion is a unique procedure in that a physician is terminating the life of one of her patients the utmost care must be taken to make sure the woman deciding to proceed with such a termination is fully informed of this
8829998 most people who point to implantation as the beginning of an individual human life offer not the slightest bit of evidence to support their claim relying instead on an alleged intuition but since such intuitions can be matched by contrary intuitions and since the alleged intuitions contradict the evidence supplied by embryological science they have no evidential weight whatsoever
8829999 science has not solved every mystery of early human development but human embryology has advanced sufficiently to enable us to dismiss certain fallacies about when a new human life comes to be we do not doubt the good faith of those who believe that individual life begins at implantation or after the powers of twinning and fusion have passed but arguments advanced to support these beliefs collapse under scrutiny we must not let the desire to use human embryos in research obscure our grasp of what those embryos truly are from day 1 namely nascent members of the human species worthy of that fundamental respect and protection that justice demands for every member of the human family
