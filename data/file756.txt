7560000 for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire
7560001 the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
7560002 therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet i will not hear them
7560003 i will tread them in mine anger and will trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment
7560004 what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
7560005 and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites
7560006 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh
7560007 a disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
7560008 so have no fear of them for nothing is covered that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known
7560009 the god that holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire abhors you and is dreadfully provoked his wrath towards you burns like fire he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire he is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight you are ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes than the most hateful venomous serpent is in ours
7560010 this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins dear friends since god so loved us we also ought to love one another no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us we know that we live in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit and we have seen and testify that the father has sent his son to be the savior of the world if anyone acknowledges that jesus is the son of god god lives in him and he in god and so we know and rely on the love god has for us god is love whoever lives in love lives in god and god in him in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love
7560011 unless you believe i am he you will die in your sins
7560012 if you are going to come and comment please come with scripture or keep it to yourself
7560013 congratulations you know how to proof text should i clap now or later for you
7560014 ah christian you are a wonderful proof texter so i have one for you
7560015 what right have you to tell of my statutes and to take my covenant in your mouth
7560016 for you hate discipline and you cast my words behind you
7560017 when you see a thief you are pleased with him and you associate with adulterers
7560018 you let your mouth loose in evil and your tongue frames deceit
7560019 you sit and speak against your brother you slander your own mothers son
7560020 these things you have done and i kept silence you thought that i was just like you i will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes
7560021 now consider this you who forget god or i will tear you in pieces and there will be none to deliver
7560022 he who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me and to him who orders his way aright i shall show the salvation of god
7560023 mark this then you who forget god lest i tear you apart and there be none to deliver
7560024 the people sat down to eat and drink and stood up to play
7560025 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
7560026 mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals
7560027 speaks to everyone just that there are many of us who are not listening he does this through nature scripture other people other bodies of work and art it is important to be discerning and in prayer
7560028 sorry if you think my answers are dodgie perhaps this is because i am not sure what youre questions are am i to take every one of your scripture references and provide you with my interpretation
7560029 a disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
7560030 so have no fear of them for nothing is covered that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be known
7560031 i dont understand why god is so gracious to save a people who dont desire him who continually turn from him
7560032 then the lord your god will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you
7560033 not having received the faith once delivered to the saints
7560034 i sense pain and agony in your recent posts including this second one on the secret things of god

7560058 when were speaking with the government were speaking about everything from environmental issue that affect our business to energy supply within canada and abroad as well as capital and jobs and economic impact
7560059 when youre asking did we speak about the oil sands i think yes we would definitely have been speaking about the oil sands and our business
7560060 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7560061 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan
7560062 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7560063 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7560064 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7560065 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defence foreign affairs and oil revenues
7560066 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7560067 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7560068 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilisation against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centrepiece of their iraq strategy
7560069 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7560070 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7560071 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7560072 this guy might offer new hope for nicky and eleanor
7560073 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7560074 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7560075 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7560076 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7560077 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7560078 my one beef with law enforcement in general is i hate the top down approach that only people with rank can think
7560079 lanier wants to convert the department from a conventional military style hierarchical culture into one driven from the bottom up that means accountability and leadership need to come from all ranks particularly from those at the bottom who play the most important role for citizens

7560096 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7560097 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7560098 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7560101 conventional wisdom holds that boom times call for new ideas and recessions call for execution that wisdom is wrong in fact even more creativity is needed when times get rough
7560102 lets cut travel budgets impose a hiring freeze and lay off the bottom 10
7560103 your competitors are going to take those same actions and there is an iron clad rule in economics in a highly competitive market any savings that are common to most suppliers get passed along to the consumer thus although you may have to take obvious actions too the only gains you get to keep will be those from ideas your competitors dont think of recessions are the best time to step up your competitiveness studies have shown that companies have twice the opportunity to change their relative position in an industry during a recession compared to growth times
7560104 everyone can be creative but you have to prepare for it with routine its a practice and its a daily practice and its a commitment but it is available to everyone
7560105 theres no other way around it its an absolute mistake to think that art is not practical or that business cannot be creative
7560106 the old method of innovation is to breed thousand of ideas like rabbits and put them through a corporate process where they are grinded through various separate departments and bottlenecks and end up damaged and unhealthy more often than not as products that miss the mark with consumers

7560117 person a is a complete moron dont listen to them because they dont know what theyre talking about
7560118 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7560119 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7560120 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side

7560140 pero cuando lleg la novena noche ella dijo he llegado a saber oh rey afortunado que cuando la bruja cogi un poco de agua y pronunci unas palabras misteriosas los peces empezaron a agitarse irguiendo la cabeza y acabaron por convertirse en hijos de ad n y en la hora y en el instante se desat la magia que sujetaba a los habitantes de la ciudad y la ciudad se convirti en una poblaci n floreciente con magn ficos zocos bien construidos y cada habitante se puso a ejercer su oficio y las monta as volvieron a ser islas como en otro tiempo y hete aqu todo lo que hubo respecto a esto por lo que se refiere a la bruja sta volvi junto al rey y como le segu a tomando por el negro le dijo oh querido m o dame tu mano generosa para besarla y el rey le respondi en voz baja ac rcate m s a m y ella se aproxim y el rey cogi de pronto su buena espada y le atraves el pecho con tal fuerza que la punta le sali por la espalda despu s dando un tajo la parti en dos mitades hecho esto sali en busca del joven encantado que le esperaba de pie entonces le felicit por su desencantamiento y el joven le bes la mano y le dio efusivamente las gracias y le dijo el rey quieres marchar a tu ciudad o acompa arme a la m a y el joven contest oh rey de los tiempos sabes cu nta distancia hay de aqu a tu ciudad y dijo el rey dos d as y medio entonces le dijo el joven oh rey si est s durmiendo despierta para ir a tu capital emplear s con la voluntad de alah todo un a o si llegaste aqu en dos d as y medio fue porque esta poblaci n estaba encantada y cuenta oh rey que no he de apartarme de ti ni siquiera el instante que dura un parpadeo el rey se alegr al o rlo y dijo bendigamos a alah que ha dispuesto te encontrase en mi camino desde hoy ser s mi hijo ya que alah no me los ha querido dar hasta ahora y se echaron uno en brazos del otro y se alegraron hasta el l mite de la alegr a dirigi ronse entonces al palacio del rey que hab a estado encantado y el joven anunci a los notables de su reino que iba a partir para la santa peregrinaci n a la meca y hechos los preparativos necesarios partieron l y el rey cuyo coraz n anhelaba el regreso a su pa s del que estaba ausente hac a un a o marcharon pues llevando cincuenta mamalik mamelucos soldados esclavos cargados de regalos y no dejaron de viajar d a y noche durante un a o entero hasta que avistaron la ciudad el visir sali con los soldados al encuentro del rey muy satisfecho de su regreso pues hab a llegado a temer no verle m s y los soldados se acercaron y besaron la tierra entre sus manos y le dieron la bienvenida y entr en el palacio y se sent en su trono despu s llam al visir y le puso al corriente de cuanto le hab a ocurrido cuando el visir supo la historia del joven le dio la enhorabuena por su desencantamiento y su salvaci n mientras tanto el rey gratific a muchas personas y despu s dijo al visir que venga aquel pescador que en otro tiempo me trajo los peces y el visir mand llamar al pescador que hab a sido causa del desencantamiento de los habitantes de la ciudad y cuando se present le orden el rey que se acercase y le regal trajes de honor pregunt ndole acerca de su manera de vivir y si ten a hijos y el pescador dijo que ten a un hijo y dos hijas entonces el rey se cas con una de sus hijas y el joven se cas con la otra despu s el rey conserv al pescador a su lado y le nombr tesorero general en seguida envi a su visir a la ciudad del joven situada en las islas negras y le nombr sult n de aquellas islas escolt ndole los cincuenta mamalik con numerosos trajes de honor para todos aquellos emires el visir al despedirse bes ambas manos del sult n y sali para su destino y el rey y el joven siguieron juntos muy felices con sus esposas las dos hijas del pescador gozando una vida de venturosa tranquilidad y cordial esparcimiento en cuanto al pescador nombrado tesorero general se enriqueci mucho y lleg a ser el hombre m s rico de su tiempo y todos los d as ve a a sus hijas que eran esposas de reyes y en tal estado despu s de numerosos a os completos fue a visitarles la separadora de los amigos la inevitable la silenciosa la inexorable y ellos murieron pero no cre is que esta historia prosigui schehrazada sea m s maravillosa que la del mandadero historia del mandadero y las tres doncellas hab a en la ciudad de bagdad un hombre que era soltero y adem s mozo de cordel un d a entre los d as mientras estaba en el zoco indolentemente apoyado en su espuerta se par delante de l una mujer con un ancho manto de tela de mussul en seda sembrada de lentejuelas de oro y forro de brocato levant un poco el velillo de la cara y aparecieron por debajo dos ojos negros con largas pesta as y qu p rpados era esbelta sus manos y sus pies muy peque os y reun a en fin un conjunto de perfectas cualidades y dijo con su voz llena de dulzura oh mandadero coge la espuerta y s gueme y el mandadero sorprendid simo no supo si hab a o do bien pero cogi la espuerta y sigui a la joven hasta que se detuvo a la puerta de una casa llam y sali un nusran nazareno cristiano que por un dinar le dio una medida de aceitunas y ella las puso en la espuerta diciendo al mozo lleva eso y s gueme y el mandadero exclam por alah bendito d a y cogi otra vez la espuerta y sigui a la joven y he aqu que se par sta en la fruter a y compr manzanas de siria membrillos osmani melocotones de om n jazmines de alepo nen fares de damasco cohombros del nilo limones de egipto cidras sultan bayas de mirto flores de henn an monas rojas de color de sangre violetas flores de granado y narcisos y lo meti todo en la espuerta del mandadero y le dijo ll valo y l lo llev y la sigui hasta que llegaron a la carnicer a donde dijo la joven corta diez artal de carne 1 y el carnicero cort los diez artal y ella los envolvi en hojas de banano los meti en la espuerta y dijo ll valo oh mandadero y l lo llev as y la sigui hasta encontrar un vendedor de almendras al cual compr la joven toda clase de almendras diciendo al mozo ll valo y s gueme y carg otra vez con la espuerta y la sigui hasta llegar a la tienda de un confitero y all compr ella una bandeja y la cubri de cuanto hab a en la confiter a enrejados de az car con manteca pastas aterciopeladas perfumadas con almizcle y deliciosamente rellenas bizcochos llamados sabun pastelillos tortas de lim n confituras sabrosas dulces llamados muchabac bocadillos huecos llamados lucmet el kad otros cuyo nombre es assabihzeinab hechos con manteca miel y leche despu s coloc todas aquellas golosinas en la bandeja y la bandeja encima de la espuerta entonces el mandadero dijo si me hubieras avisado habr a alquilado una mula para cargar tanta cosa y la joven sonri al o rlo despu s se detuvo en casa de un destilador y compr diez clases de aguas de rosas de azahar y otras muchas y varias bebidas embriagadoras como asimismo un hisopo para aspersiones de agua de rosas almizclada granos de incienso macho palo de loe mbar gris y almizcle y finalmente velas de cera de alejandr a todo lo meti en la espuerta y dijo al mozo lleva la espuerta y s gueme y el mozo la sigui llevando siempre la espuerta hasta que la joven lleg a un palacio todo de m rmol con un gran patio que daba al jard n de atr s todo era muy lujoso y el p rtico ten a dos hojas de bano adornadas con chapas de oro rojo la joven llam y las dos hojas de la puerta se abrieron el mandadero vio entonces que hab a abierto la puerta otra joven cuyo talle elegante y gracioso era un verdadero modelo especialmente por sus pechos redondos y salientes su gentil apostura su belleza y todas las perfecciones de su talle y de todo lo dem s su frente era blanca como la primera luz de la luna nueva sus ojos como los ojos de las gacelas sus cejas como la luna creciente del ramad n sus mejillas como an monas su boca como el sello de soleim n su rostro como la luna llena al salir sus dos pechos como granadas gemelas en cuanto a su vientre juvenil el stico y flexible se ocultaba bajo la ropa como una carta preciada bajo el rollo que la envuelve por eso a su vista not el mozo que se le iba el juicio y que la espuerta se le ven a al suelo y dijo para s por alah en mi vida he tenido un d a tan bendito como el de hoy entonces esta joven tan admirable dijo a su hermana la proveedora y al mandadero entrad y que la acogida aqu sea para vosotros tan amplia como agradable y entraron y acabaron por llegar a una sala espaciosa que daba al patio adornada con brocados de seda y oro llena de lujosos muebles con incrustaciones de oro jarrones asientos esculpidos cortinas y unos roperos cuidadosamente cerrados en medio de la sala hab a un lecho de m rmol incrustado con perlas y esplendorosa pedrer a cubierto con un dosel de raso rojo sobre l estaba extendido un mosquitero de fina gasa tambi n rojo y en el lecho hab a una joven de maravillosa hermosura con ojos babil nicos un talle esbelto como la letra aleph y un rostro tan bello que pod a envidiarlo el sol luminoso era una estrella brillante una noble hermosura de arabia como dijo el poeta el que mida tu talle oh joven y lo compare por su esbeltez con la delicadeza de una rama flexible juzga con error a pesar de su talento porque tu talle no tiene igual ni tu cuerpo un hermano porque la rama s lo es linda en el rbol y estando desnuda mientras que t eres hermosa de todos modos y las ropas que te cubren son nicamente una delicia m s entonces la joven se levant y llegando junto a sus hermanas les dijo por qu permanec is quietas quitad la carga de la cabeza de ese hombre entonces entre las tres le aliviaron del peso vaciaron la espuerta pusieron cada cosa en su sitio y entregando dos dinares al mandadero le dijeron oh mandadero vuelve la cara y vete inmediatamente pero el mozo miraba a las j venes encantado de tanta belleza y tanta perfecci n y pensaba que en su vida hab a visto nada semejante sin embargo choc bale que no hubiese ning n hombre en la casa en seguida se fij en lo que all hab a de bebidas frutas flores olorosas y otras cosas buenas y admirado hasta el l mite de la admiraci n no ten a maldita la gana de marcharse entonces la mayor de las doncellas le dijo por qu no te vas es que te parece poco el salario y se volvi hacia su hermana la que hab a hecho las compras y le dijo dale otro dinar pero el mandadero replic por alah se oras m as mi salario suele ser la cent sima parte de un dinar por lo cual no me ha parecido escasa la paga pero mi coraz n est pendiente de vosotras y me pregunto cu l puede ser vuestra vida ya que viv s en esta soledad y no hay hombre que os haga compa a no sab is que un minarete s lo vale algo con la condici n de ser uno de los cuatro de la mezquita pero oh se oras m as no sois m s que tres y os falta el cuarto ya sab is que la dicha de las mujeres nunca es perfecta si no se unen con los hombres y como dice el poeta un acorde no ser jam s armonioso como no re nan cuatro instrumentos el arpa el la d la c tara y la flauta vosotras oh se oras m as s lo sois tres y os falta el cuarto instrumento la flauta yo ser la flauta y me conducir como hombre prudente lleno de sagacidad e inteligencia artista h bil que sabe guardar un secreto y las j venes le dijeron oh mandadero no sabes t que somos v rgenes por eso tenemos miedo de fiarnos de algo porque hemos le do lo que dicen los poetas desconf a de toda confidencia pues un secreto revelado es secreto perdido pero el mandadero exclam juro por vuestra vida oh se oras m as que yo soy un hombre prudente seguro y leal he le do libros y he estudiado cr nicas s lo cuento cosas agradables call ndome cuidadosamente las cosas tristes obro en toda ocasi n seg n dice el poeta s lo el hombre bien dotado sabe callar el secreto s lo los mejores entre los hombres saben cumplir sus promesas yo encierro los secretos en una casa de s lidos candados donde la llave se ha perdido y la puerta est sellada y escuchando los versos del mandadero muchas otras estrofas que recit y sus improvisaciones rimadas las tres j venes se tranquilizaron pero para no ceder en seguida le dijeron sabe oh mandadero que en este palacio hemos gastado el dinero en enormes cantidades llevas t encima con qu indemnizarnos s lo te podremos invitar con la condici n de que gastes mucho oro acaso no es tu deseo permanecer con nosotras acompa arnos a beber y singularmente hacernos velar toda la noche hasta que la aurora ba e nuestros rostros y la mayor de las doncellas a adi amor sin dinero no puede servir de buen contrapeso en el platillo de la balanza y la que hab a abierto la puerta dijo si no tienes nada vete sin nada pero en aquel momento intervino la proveedora y dijo oh hermanas m as dejemos eso por alah pues este muchacho en nada ha de amenguarnos el d a adem s cualquier otro hombre no habr a tenido con nosotras tanto comedimiento y cuanto le toque pagar a l yo lo abonar en su lugar entonces el mandadero se regocij en extremo y dijo a la que le hab a defendido por alah a ti te debo la primera ganancia del d a y dijeron las tres qu date oh buen mandadero y te tendremos sobre nuestras cabezas y nuestros ojos y en seguida la proveedora se levant y se ajust el cintur n luego dispuso los frascos clasific el vino por decantaci n prepar el lugar en que hab an de reunirse cerca del estanque y llev all cuanto pod an necesitar despu s ofreci el vino y todo el mundo se sent y el mandadero en medio de ellas en el v rtigo pues se figuraba estar so ando y he aqu que la proveedora ofreci la vasija del vino y llenaron la copa y la bebieron y as por segunda y por tercera vez despu s la proveedora la llen de nuevo y la present a sus hermanas y luego al mandadero y el mandadero extasiado improvis esta composici n rimada bebe este vino l es la causa de toda nuestra alegr a el da al que lo bebe fuerzas y salud l es el nico remedio que cura todos los males nadie bebe el vino origen de toda alegr a sin sentir las emociones m s gratas la embriaguez es lo nico que puede saturarnos de voluptuosidad despu s bes las manos de las tres doncellas y vaci la copa en seguida aproxim ndose a la mayor dijo oh se ora m a soy tu esclavo tu cosa y tu propiedad y recit estas estrofas en honor suyo a tu puerta espera de pie un esclavo de tus ojos acaso el m s humilde de tus esclavos pero conoce a su due a l sabe cu nta es su generosidad y sus beneficios y sobre todo sabe c mo se lo ha de agradecer entonces ella le dijo ofreci ndole la copa bebe oh amigo m o y que la bebida te aproveche y la digieras bien que ella te d fuerzas para el camino de la verdadera salud y el mandadero cogi la copa bes la mano a la joven y con una voz dulce y modulada cant quedamente estos versos yo ofrezco a mi amiga 2 un vino resplandeciente como sus mejillas mejillas tan luminosas que s lo la caridad de una llama podr a compararse con su espl ndida vida ella se digna aceptarlo pero me dice muy risue a c mo quieres que beba mis propias mejillas y yo le digo bebe oh llama de mi coraz n este licor son mis l grimas su color rojo mi sangre y su mezcla en la copa es toda mi alma entonces la joven cogi la copa de manos del mandadero se la llev a los labios y despu s fue a sentarse junto a sus hermanas y todos empezaron a cantar a danzar y a jugar con las flores exquisitas y mientras tanto el mozo las abrazaba y las besaba y una le dirig a chanzas otra lo atra a hacia ella y la otra le golpeaba con las flores y siguieron bebiendo hasta que el vino se les subi a la cabeza cuando el vino rein por completo la joven que hab a abierto la puerta se levant se quit toda la ropa y se qued desnuda y de un salto ech su alma 3 en el estanque y se puso a jugar con el agua se llen de ella la boca y roci ruidosamente al mandadero esto no le estorbaba para que el agua corriese por todos sus miembros y por entre sus muslos juveniles despu s sali del estanque se ech sobre el pecho del mandadero y extendi ndose luego boca arriba dijo se alando a la cosa situada entre sus muslos oh mi querido sabes c mo se llama esto y contest el mozo ah ah ordinariamente suele llamarse la casa de la misericordia pero ella exclam yu yu no te da verg enza tu ignorancia y le cogi del pescuezo y empez a darle golpes entonces dijo l basta basta se llama la vulva y repiti ella tampoco es as y el mandadero dijo pues tu pedazo de atr s y ella repiti otra cosa y dijo l es tu z ngano pero ella al o rlo golpe al joven con tal fuerza que le ara la piel y entonces l dijo pues dime c mo se llama y ella contest la albahaca de los puentes y exclam el mozo ya era hora alabado sea alah y l te guarde oh mi albahaca de los puentes despu s volvi a circular la copa y la subcopa en seguida la segunda joven se desnud y se meti en el estanque e hizo lo mismo que su hermana sali despu s se ech en el regazo del mozo y se alando con el dedo hacia sus muslos y a la cosa situada entre los muslos pregunt cu l es el nombre de esto luz de mis ojos y l dijo tu grieta pero ella exclam qu palabras tan abominables dice este hombre y le abofete con tal furia que retembl toda la sala y despu s dijo l entonces ser la albahaca de los puentes pero ella replic no es eso no es eso y volvi a darle golpes entonces pregunt el mozo pues cu l es su nombre y contest ella el s samo descortezado y l exclam para ti sean oh el m s descortezado entre los s samos las mejores bendiciones despu s se levant la tercera joven se desnud y se meti en el estanque donde hizo como sus hermanas y luego se visti y fue a tenderse entre las piernas del mandadero y le dijo se alando hacia sus partes delicadas adivina su nombre entonces l le dijo se llama esto se llama lo otro y numerando con los dedos dec a el estornino mudo el conejo sin orejas el polluelo sin voz el padre de la blancura la fuente de las gracias y por fin en vista de sus protestas acab preguntando para que no le pegara m s pues cu l es su nombre y ella contest el khan la posada de aby mansur entonces el mandadero se levant se despoj de sus vestiduras y se meti en el agua y su espalda sobrenadaba majestuosa en la superficie se lav todo el cuerpo como se hab an lavado las doncellas y despu s sali del ba o y fue a echarse en el regazo de la m s joven apoy los pies en el regazo de la otra hermana y se alando a su virilidad pregunt a la mayor de todas sabes oh soberana m a cu l es su nombre al o r estas palabras las tres se echaron a re r tan a gusto que cayeron sobre sus posaderas y exclamaron tu zib y l dijo no es eso no es eso y les dio a cada una un mordisco entonces dijeron tu herramienta y l contest tampoco es eso y a cada una les dio un pellizco en un seno y ellas asombradas replicaron s que es tu herramienta porque est ardiente s que es tu zib porque se mueve y el mozo segu a negando con un movimiento de cabeza y luego las besaba las mord a las pellizcaba y las abrazaba y ellas re an a m s no poder hasta que acabaron por decirle c mo se llama pues entonces l medit un momento se mir entre los muslos gui los ojos y se alando a su zib dijo oh se oras m as vais a o r lo que acaba de decirme este ni o me llaman el macho poderoso y sin castrar que pace la albahaca de los puentes se deleita con raciones de s samo descortezado y se alberga en la posada de aby mansur y se rieron las tres tan descompasadamente al o rle que de nuevo doblaron sobre sus partes traseras despu s siguieron bebiendo en la misma copa hasta que comenz a anochecer las j venes dijeron al mandadero ahora vuelve la cara y vete y as veremos la anchura de tus hombros pero el mozo exclam por alah se oras m as m s f cil ser a a mi alma salir del cuerpo que a m dejar esta casa juntemos esta noche con el d a y ma ana podr cada uno ir en busca de su destino por el camino de alah entonces intervino nuevamente la joven proveedora hermanas por vuestra vida invit mosle a pasar la noche con nosotras y nos reiremos mucho con l porque es una mala persona sin pudor y adem s muy gracioso y dijeron entonces al mandadero puedes pasar aqu la noche con la condici n de estar bajo nuestro dominio y no pedir ninguna explicaci n sobre lo que veas ni sobre cuanto ocurra y l respondi as sea oh se oras m as y ellas a adieron lev ntate y lee lo que est escrito encima de las puertas y l se levant y encima de la puerta vio las siguientes palabras escritas con letras de oro no hables nunca de lo que no te importe si no oir s cosas que no te gusten y el mandadero dijo oh se

7560151 companies that can combine the computing power and connectivity of laptops with the obvious limitations of indoor gps will see a lot of success a good example of suitable design is csrs software gps bluetooth combo chip with e gps assistance of course oems arent the only route to market here skyhook wireless is seeing increased interest in its wi fi solution from web browsers with a view to including small location aware plug ins
7560152 i think we will see this eventually being adopted across the whole camera market from holiday makers to professionals new compact cameras such as the nikon p6000 have gps inbuilt whilst slr cameras have had external gps devices since 2006 however cameras have limited space size and cost margins while ttffs must be almost instantaneous for geotagging looking beyond existing gps designs innovative approaches from geotate software gps and air semi dynamic continuous gps are purpose built

7560160 what young women do not understand is that the interest of many of their suitors may not be because of their hotness it might be that these boys are both lonely and desperate
7560161 to correct this situation women need to deflate their perceived hotness by the proportion by which single men outnumber single women
7560162 rural australia is littered with towns where there is an oversupply of single men
7560163 women have changed their priorities thirty years ago they may have married straight out of school to the farmer next door but now they are saying they want education and training and job opportunities and they gravitate to the cities
7560164 it upsets the gender balance in rural areas and the cities so you have concepts like they reflect that because all these single women gravitate to the city for jobs thats the divide that has opened up and you get these quite remarkable figures like at glenden

7560173 it doesnt have to be messy however when couples take advantage of divorce mediation services they can iron out many of their differences in advance of court hearings saving themselves time money and heartache in the process
7560174 we are very pleased that we will soon be able to offer our services to couples in the scottsdale region
7560175 when it is at all feasible mediation simply makes sense to save families the misery a long drawn out court based divorce can produce
7560176 when mediation is used divorcing couples do not have to surrender control of their lives to an attorney or judge

7560211 el f tbol es el deporte m s popular en toda am rica latina
7560212 saladino cielo y robles y sus disciplinas no son tan populares como cristiano ronaldo y el f tbol
7560213 ni hay conocimiento de todo lo que ofrecen las olimpiadas ni hay inter s en disciplinas que en nuestros pa ses no se practican de manera sobresaliente
7560214 no hay pol ticas p blicas que fomenten la diversidad deportiva que existe en una justa ol mpica mientras que en los pa ses desarrollados s existe esa variedad y esa promoci n
7560215 latinoam rica exceptuando a cuba no ha hecho del deporte algo de la vida cotidiana no hay una valoraci n social del deporte
7560216 los que sobresalen en alguna disciplina es porque lo lograron con sus esfuerzos sus sacrificios y hasta porque se tuvieron que pelear con el gobierno en vez de recibir su apoyo se dificulta que un deportista pueda dedicarse a su disciplina a tiempo completo
7560217 una vez descubiertos intervienen el gobierno y la iniciativa privada para impulsarlos pero todo el camino para llegar a ser h roes deportivos lo recorrieron sin apoyo
7560218 es duro ser un deportista de alto rendimiento en am rica latina muchos de ellos trabajan adem s de entrenar unos deben enfrentar dificultades econ micas y otros no cuentan con los elementos o las tecnolog as para practicar
7560219 se necesitan dos ciclos para tener a un deportista bien preparado hacia el logro son requeridos ocho a os de formaci n pues las primeras olimpiadas son m s de adaptaci n y de conocimiento el atleta busca bajar su marca lo cual alimenta su nivel de confianza y su posibilidad de tener un patrocinante y de ser reconocido a nivel nacional
7560220 en el deporte las im genes son fomentadas desde los medios de comunicaci n estos dolos que se crean son una estrategia medi tica
7560221 aunque tengamos deportistas muy destacados en otras disciplinas no son fomentados como figuras porque son fen menos muy puntuales que cuando aparecen en los medios ya pasaron de moda ya no son figuras de actualidad la mayor parte de los deportistas latinoamericanos tienen un paso ef mero por la fama
7560222 hay una especie de desencanto y de frustraci n al ver los medalleros al ver que los pa ses latinoamericanos dejando a un lado a cuba no ocupan lugares sobresalientes en los medalleros
7560223 saben que sus competidores no llegan a las olimpiadas y si llegan quedan excluidos de los primeros lugares es una especie de rechazo nacionalista localista porque no son sus contendientes los que est n disputando las medallas
7560224 lamentablemente el espectador siempre est ligado al triunfalismo el segundo o el tercer puesto no son reconocidos por el espectador pese a que el proceso que llev al deportista a ese logro fue intens simo

7560251 my friends money is not all it is not money that will mend a broken heart or reassemble the fragments of a dream money cannot brighten the hearth nor repair the portals of a shattered home i refer of course to confederate money
7560252 actually i have no regard for money aside from its purchasing power its completely useless as far as i am concerned
7560253 its obvious from the players reactions and the success of the event that we certainly would like to come back here
7560254 its just a matter of how soon the club would be willing to host this again
7560255 if they would like to come we would like to have them
7560256 when that depends on so many things we have to see how much the support stays with the membership

7560433 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7560434 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7560435 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7560436 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7560437 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7560438 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny

7560449 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7560450 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it

7560468 it was about 2pm when danny rang me and he sounded fine he didnt sound panicked its just not like him to vanish without trace
7560469 ive kind of accepted im never going to see him again but someone must have seen something someone must know something
7560470 dannys very sociable makes friends easily and is highly intelligent hes also very non confrontational
7560471 when i got to koh pha ngan the police knew very little about the case they hadnt even searched the area where danny was last seen its a bit of a disgrace really
7560472 he had been in regular contact with us the whole time so when we didnt hear from him for a couple of days i thought it was pretty strange i started trying to find him and asking around
7560473 there was nothing to suggest he was depressed i really cant fathom what happened to him
7560474 its very very strange the bar isnt near a beach but i suppose its possible he could have wandered down to the sea gone swimming and got into difficulty
7560475 but a body would usually get washed up if someone drowned if hed fallen or had an accident near the bar he would have been found by now
7560476 there can be the occasional fight in the backyard bar but no one saw any argument taking place that day as far as i know

7560508 if a woman chooses abortion shes entitled to a dead body no matter what
7560509 you need to know that barack obama is a monster and a liar who would be very much at home in communist china where killing babies is an industry
7560510 believes so firmly in abortion he is so radical in his support for abortion and infanticide that he believes that if a woman chooses abortion shes entitled to a dead body no matter what
7560511 if a woman chooses abortion shes entitled to a dead body no matter what
7560512 then pennsylvanias governor was blocked from speaking at the 1992 convention because of his anti abortion views
7560513 sen barack obama has invited senator bob casey of pennsylvania an abortion rights opponent to give a convention speech
7560514 mr caseys father then pennsylvanias governor was blocked from speaking at the 1992 convention because of his anti abortion views
7560515 have always said that had casey not declined to endorse mr
7560516 according to those who actually doled out the 1992 convention speaking slots casey was denied a turn for one simple reason his refusal to endorse the clinton gore ticket
7560517 sixteen years ago the democratic party refused to allow robert p casey sr then the governor of pennsylvania to speak at its national convention because his anti abortion views stemming from his roman catholic faith clashed with the partys platform and powerful constituencies

7560519 i thought baby fat was one of the chinese volleyball players
7560520 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7560521 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7560525 dining facilities on campuses take up five times more water five times more energy five times more waste per square foot than the dorm
7560526 without the tray it just doesnt give you that i need to go everywhere and fill up my tray and then sit down option
7560527 instead youre saying i like this item on the menu today
7560528 thats how we get to as close to 0 waste as possible
7560529 fundamentally i think consumers have to understand that some of the responsibility lies with them to create less waste
7560530 if we create less waste we dont even have to consider a need for back end technologies
7560531 it is only a fairly recent phenomenon that the 200 meter typically yields a faster average speed than the 100 meter sprint
7560532 one of the amazing things about johnson s 1996 world record in the 200 meters is that his pace or average speed for the 200 meter record was faster than the average speed for the fastest 100 meters johnson covering twice the distance and running the curve was able to sustain an average speed of 9 66 seconds per 100 meters at the time donovan bailey s world record in the 100 meters was 9 84 seconds
7560533 it is only a fairly recent phenomenon that the 200 meter typically yields a faster average speed than the 100 meter sprint

7560537 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7560538 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7560539 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it

7560541 my plea to you is lets get this family together and win
7560542 we believe that this investigation of the irs is completely unfounded and politically motivated
7560543 there is a very clear effort national in scale to discredit defame and intimidate ministries and preachers of what has come to be called the
7560544 those behind these attacks we will for the moment only identify as enemies of the gospel often politically motivated they are fearful not only of the moral imperative communicated by these ministries but the growing wealth and influence of those constituencies in the natural world money is power and influence so a wealthy church individually and collectively is without question going to gain increasing visibility and influence in its city state and nation the opponents of christian ideology rightly understand that to limit our influence they must limit our growing wealth and to accomplish this goal they must undermine and corrupt the commitment of the donor base
7560545 the media allegations mean little or nothing if you keep the larger context in mind our individual level of wealth according to god eph 3 20 can potentially exceed what we can even ask or think limited only by the power of faith that works in us
7560546 i refuse to ever be embarrassed or apologetic for the level of gods blessing upon my life and believe every day that my preaching will have the same effect upon your life
7560547 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7560548 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7560549 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7560550 based on this analysis we can say that there is a 94 percent probability of imminent global cooling and the beginning of the coming ice age
7560551 most of these major natural processes that we are witnessing now are interdependent and occur at the end of each interglacial period ultimately causing sudden long term cooling
7560552 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7560553 i did say that and at the time i meant it but having now spent a great deal of time with obama i am convinced that hes ready for the job ahead hes a quick study and he has immersed himself in the details of foreign policy hes already shown far better judgment on these issues than john mccain has shown
7560554 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7560555 im voting for candidate x not because i like him or her but because i like the other candidate even less
7560556 for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction
7560557 democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried
7560558 obviously businesspeople are concerned and are closely monitoring events but business activity goes on as usual
7560559 these things have happened before and you just take them in stride
7560560 the benefits you stand to gain from doing business in mindanao still far exceed the risks you factor into locating here
7560561 since participants have committed themselves to attending the minbizcon and the pnp philippine national police and afp armed forces of the philippines have guaranteed security there is no reason not to push through with the event
7560562 canneries are still working and new foreign buyers are still coming in others will be attending the 10th national tuna congress they still want to do business here
7560563 they want to get harvests in before ramadan begins next week
7560564 this has been a good year for the entry of locators in service industries related to agribusiness such as cold storage plants and container terminals for both international and domestic destinations
7560565 we strongly feel we have to show the rest of the world we are not fazed by recent events
7560566 here in cagayan de oro theres a lot of tolerance different groups live and work side by side peacefully
7560567 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7560568 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7560569 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7560570 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7560571 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7560572 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7560573 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support
7560574 wird man f r die nationalmannschaft ausgesucht ist der zug in richtung allgemeinbildung f r einen im grunde schon abgefahren
7560575 in der vergangenheit haben wir viel zu gro es gewicht auf das heranziehen von nationalen champions gelegt was aber macht jemand der es nicht zur goldmedallie schafft der steht dann mit enormen wissensl cken und einem sehr niedrigen ausbildungsstand da und kann in der gesellschaft kaum fu fassen
7560576 in china stehen die sportler vor besonders gro en herausforderungen wenn sich ihre karriere dem ende zuneigt
7560577 alle probleme mit denen chinesische ex sportler in der gesellschaft konfrontiert werden haben li ning und andere vorstandsmitglieder die fr her ebenfalls olympioniken waren selbst hautnah erlebt
7560578 wir sehen englisch als wichtigstes sprungbrett f r jede art von karriere es bildet die grundlage in unternehmen arbeiten zu k nnen im ausland zu studieren internationalen sportorganisationen beizutreten und man ist in der lage mit der fremdsprachlichen kompetenz internationale kontakte kn pfen

7560586 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements that currently oppose the interests of the russian federation
7560587 we dont feel or see any advantages from membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden
7560588 judging by the rhetoric of the last few days it seems things are moving toward a sharp confrontation between russia and practically the whole of the rest of the world
7560589 that has every chance of spilling out into real action from both sides perhaps the halting of the wto accession process could be the first real step a real consequence of the war
7560590 its another reason for investors to question the governments commitment to not just the reform agenda but the whole economic program that was set out as part of the political transition
7560591 the main concern for investors from all these recent events is that the program could be materially changing i e perhaps less emphasis on the diversification and the openness

7560593 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright

7560595 what are stars doing with these baby names so many of them are crazy
7560596 i heard two reports one saying the baby was a boy and one saying it was a girl either way zuma reminds me too much of the malt beverage zima so i think of beer
7560597 i have no idea what they were thinking with zuma i think the first middle name was some sort of shout out to bob marley as was kingston jamaica but i have no idea what zuma is other than a video game
7560598 maybe it has some significance for her was she ever in nigeria zuma rock is a large monolith located in niger state just north of abuja along the main road from abuja the capital of nigeria to kaduna
7560599 i kind of like the name but then i liked it when my grandmother named her chihuahua zuma as well
7560600 the only good thing about all these crazy names is at least theyll be the only one in their class with that name i doubt theres gonna be zuma r zuma s zuma w

7560605 its not dark outside anymore i ready to go downstairs
7560606 i like the office i dont like the person who is in there now id like to get someone in there who i thought would make a sound solid vice president of the united states and mr obama picked him the other day joe biden
7560607 has fought all the disgraceful efforts to undermine the state of law in our own government
7560608 the first big choice that a presidential candidate makes that is not ambiguous that gives us a real clue about what kind of president he will be is the selection he makes as his running mate and he picked joe biden and joe biden is the best

7560617 slipknots all hope is gone another step in a new direction
7560618 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7560619 we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7560620 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7560621 we have to recognize however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7560622 at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7560623 successive decisions have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos
7560624 these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project

7560629 we have all been so looking forward to coming home and it is amazing just fantastic
7560630 you live in a bubble in the village and really have no idea what is happening at home it is only when you land and arrive here that you see how many people have turned up
7560631 it is just incredible the nation has got behind us it is fantastic
7560632 both me and chris came out here to just try our best to get a medal anything else that comes our way is an added bonus
7560633 team gb have provided us with just the most extraordinary platform one we could not possibly imagine before we came here
7560634 its the opportunity to drive the project for us but take nothing from any of those guys whove performed i think way beyond what i think any of us were expecting

7560637 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7560638 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7560639 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7560640 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7560641 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7560642 the council or its agents to make inquiries to corroborate this claim
7560643 councils will naturally wish to ensure council tax discounts and benefits are not wrongly claimed but i am concerned that innocent citizens will be spied on through heavy handed and disproportionate use of town hall snoopers
7560644 there are far less intrusive and more cost effective ways of vetting council tax than paying town hall officials to camp overnight outside peoples homes
7560645 the intrusiveness of the surveillance is kept to a minimum only doing the least amount necessary to obtain the information required
7560646 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7560647 we already pay so much to use the roads congestion charge road tax petrol duty so i cant believe the government are even thinking of doing that
7560648 i think were looking to see how the democrats behave
7560649 theyre coming into this all of them on the same page but with varying levels of enthusiasm
7560650 were all waiting to see what they have to say and how they say it
7560651 this thing feels like its gone off like a rocket

7560669 the closeness of the relationship that we developed in prison is hard to adequately describe
7560670 and the senior officers especially recognized that many of us were weak and sometimes didnt do too well under the pressure of our interrogators as perhaps we would have liked to they displayed compassion by encouraging us even if we had failed to go back again and do better next time
7560671 recognition of my own failures had the obvious result of making me a lot more tolerant of the failings of others
7560672 there are individual vietnamese who if i saw them again i am sure i would attempt to inflict some physical punishment
7560673 but the south vietnamese were our allies and friends and they are now part of overall vietnam
7560674 and my job was to help the healing and reconciliation process so we could give help to those vietnam veterans who had not come all the way home to continue that journey

7560677 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7560678 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7560679 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7560683 the closer women get to achieving power the more conversation there is about that and the more concern there is among some women about how men may react
7560684 we are at the end of a time when you only look at advocacy and victimization
7560685 we know darn well were not there yet but these young women are deeply thoughtful and to go about getting power we have to be united

7560875 the free thought movement has never been stronger in this country
7560876 i dont have a problem with people expressing their points of view in public
7560877 i would prefer that there was serious tolerant dialogue that might emerge from this publicity campaign because it is much needed
7560878 the ffrf fails to acknowledge history which recognized the strong christian commitment of those who attended the constitutional convention
7560879 since evolutionists are liars and most do not really believe evolution we could employ truth serum or water boarding to obtain confessions of evolution rejection
7560880 the violent expulsion of all evolutionist from civilised society as i say another pol pot hitler
7560881 largely unproductive leaches on the productive members of society else they are totally destructive
7560882 evolution tends to attract people whose intellects are sub par
7560883 gravitate to employment positions where knowledge truth character logic etc are not needed typically education and the media
7560884 evolutionists are manifestly the most dangerous and destructive people on this planet
7560885 the only slavers that evolutionists will admit that ever existed are southern u s
7560886 i am quite serious that their evolutionists danger to society is so great that in any sane society they would at a minimum be denied a vote as well as any job where they might influence immature people

7560890 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
7560891 biden camp pressed hard for a slot on the ticket
7560892 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7560893 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage
7560894 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7560895 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7560896 like president bush sen mccain is presenting the american people with a false choice national security or civil liberties we need a president who understands that we can have both
7560897 help carry out obamas agenda of change in a broken washington
7560898 he wanted to see how the decision sat with him
7560899 after having a president for eight years who cant go beyond talking points its a good thing that biden can dig into the issues even if he occasionally goes overboard
7560900 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7560901 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7560902 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7560903 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7560904 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7560905 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7560906 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7560907 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7560908 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7560909 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7560910 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7560911 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7560912 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7560913 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7560914 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7560915 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7560916 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7560917 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7560918 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7560919 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7560920 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7560921 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7560929 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7560930 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7560931 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7560932 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7560933 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7560934 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7560935 this is my kind of guy girl its as if he she knows me
7560936 hi i heard you talking about that persons topic of interest and i was wondering what you think about something related to the topic im interested to know your opinion

7560950 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7560951 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7560952 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7560953 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7560954 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7560955 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7560956 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7560957 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7560958 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7560959 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7560960 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7560961 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7560962 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7560963 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7560969 advanced technologies such as aaa mobile make access to aaas trusted route guidance restaurant and lodging information and member roadside services now more convenient than ever

7560975 going through tax reform was a tough thing to do
7560976 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
7560977 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
7560978 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
7560979 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term

7560981 we spent significant time and resources this summer developing the best possible review products for the students of texas were excited to be able to help them on these tests
7560982 our focus has always been the students how we can make the site easier for them to use and what will help them most on their upcoming test this is why we have developed features like diagnostic tests and fun interactive games that are all based on the state specific standards
7560983 soon after the state releases the eoc curriculum and blueprints
7560984 we believe we see a trend developing among large institutional investors in the direction of setting up smaller funds earmarked for special purposes
7560985 environmental issues are one possible option for a special mandate
7560986 we have special characteristics to our role as investor which might lead to finding more long term approaches in our assessment of what investment may be seen as commercially interesting
7560987 we can also explore if there are any other opportunities in such investments by moving into new asset classes which the larger main fund is not allowed to invest in or in regions that fallout outside the scope of its investment universe
7560988 the time has come by making itself the broker of the peace deal the eu has the responsibility to ensure it is followed through otherwise it could lose face
7560989 but there are still big divisions and they are not going to go away
7560990 well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7560991 an esdp european security and defence policy mission is one option but the question is what form at the moment it seems it would be more about monitoring than peacekeeping
7560992 russia seeks only a vague document while the eu wants a legally binding treaty that includes trade and energy
7560993 a threat to the success of those games would be taken seriously by the russians
7560994 now that the markets are starting to realize the magnitude of supply growth investors are starting to focus on just how low prices can go
7560995 there had been anticipation of some weather catalyst either hot weather or hurricanes and both have been a no show
7560996 this system should track northwestward and potentially track over southwestern or western haiti late tuesday night or early wednesday morning as a 60 mph tropical storm this system may then track into the southeastern and central bahamas during thursday by friday this system may be tracking slowly northwestward across the central and northwestern bahamas as a strong tropical storm or category 1 hurricane
7560997 this system needs to be watched very closely as it poses a threat to hispaniola jamaica eastern cuba and the southeastern bahamas this system also will need to be watched closely along the entire u s coastline as its exact forecast track is uncertain at this point
7560998 development if any is expected to be slow to occur

7561006 she nicked my old guitar teacher off me his names monte

7561011 la ltima vez tuvimos un partido de liga el mi rcoles y otro el lunes esta vez lo intentaremos todo por ganar todos quieren tener la supercopa en su palmar s es un entorno diferente un encuentro especial que quieres ganar es el campe n de europa ante los ganadores de la copa de la uefa y puede que no sea algo tan grande como lo vivido en mosc donde el united se hizo con la corona europea a expensas del chelsea fc pero igualmente es algo que queremos tener
7561012 queremos ganar trofeos todo el tiempo y eso te da confianza en el comienzo de la temporada para poder ganar t tulos adem s es una oportunidad de sumar minutos para los jugadores que quiz s no est n en plena forma
7561013 es un nico partido e intentaremos jugar lo mejor posible y ganar es una oportunidad muy importante ya que se puede ganar un t tulo en 90 minutos no fue un partido tan importante para m en 2001 como ahora lo es en esta ocasi n con suerte ser mi primer partido de la temporada vamos a ver como van los entrenamientos porque arrastr este problema f sico desde hace 16 meses
7561014 tiene potencial para dominar el f tbol los pr ximos cinco a os
7561015 la pasada temporada acab de una forma incre ble para m y para el equipo por suerte he podido formar parte de esto los jugadores que s lo llevan un a o en el club no pueden nada m s que mejorar
7561016 hay que afrontar el partido con la debida seriedad para poder estar tranquilos y asegurarnos la clasificaci n para la champions el resultado de ida es lo suficientemente bueno pero no nos tenemos que confiar acabamos de comenzar y la imagen del equipo y las sensaciones son buenas y hay que mantenerlas hay que buscar un buen resultado no s lo para asegurar la clasificaci n sino para continuar con el buen nivel demostrado hasta ahora
7561017 decidir la alineaci n y la t ctica para este partido va a ser un dolor de cabeza
7561018 este partido es como una prueba para ver de lo que es capaz el equipo el manchester es muy fuerte y habr que tratarlo con mucho respeto
7561019 nuestro calendario de liga est muy apretado pero hemos tenido tiempo para preparar este encuentro de m naco ser psicol gicamente m s f cil que otros porque en liga nuestro aficionados s lo esperan victorias y eso significa mucha presi n
7561020 esa comparaci n puede ser cierta pero con una peque a diferencia el manchester united es m s fuerte que el bayern
7561021 muchas cosas han cambiado desde la final tras la euro 2008 los internacionales rusos volvieron muy cansados adem s hemos tenido un calendario muy duro en la liga los rumores sobre la posible salida de andrei arshavin tambi n est n durando demasiado por otra parte la temporada pasada los rivales no nos conoc an pero ahora las cosas son m s dif ciles para nosotros
7561022 esta historia ya ha durado seis semanas y no voy a negar que ha tenido un impacto negativo en el equipo y en nuestros resultados espero que en los pr ximos d as se defina el tema en un sentido u otro
7561023 para participar con un calendario tan complicado necesitamos m s jugadores desgraciadamente son pocos los buenos jugadores que aceptan trasladarse a rusia no tiene que ver con el nivel de la liga porque el nivel es alto tiene m s que ver con la infraestructura y los largos viajes en los partidos fuera de casa

7561078 i think the government is probably scrambling because they realise they havent taken the action thats needed and they are trying to figure out a way to put their mark on the inquiry

7561116 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7561117 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7561118 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7561119 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7561120 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7561121 i think its quite right that the judge made the type of decision that he would make in any other case and that mr hutton shouldnt be prejudiced by his celebrity

7561156 surgical and medical management has reduced the mortality rate for congenital heart defects but hypoplastic left heart syndrome remains a problem
7561157 it has been thought for some time that genetic factors play a major role in heart defects but it has been difficult to apply standard genetic techniques to the problem
7561158 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes

7561163 mark steven johnson who brought daredevil and ghost rider to the big screen told the continuum that his attempts to bring garth ennis preacher to hbo as a series were close but ultimately unsuccessful
7561164 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
7561165 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
7561166 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
7561167 ive heard someone is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film i hope that happens but i hope it happens as a series of movies as one movie couldnt do it justice i really love that story and i dedicated a lot of my time to honor garths work but it wasnt meant to be

7561199 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7561200 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7561201 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7561202 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7561203 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7561204 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7561205 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7561206 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7561207 got something youve seen in midtown that youre afraid to try
7561208 link to search results for obama and mccain so you dont have to type in their names on your phone each time you want information

7561224 clinton ha dicho repetidas veces que barack obama y ella comparten el compromiso de cambiar el rumbo del pa s de sacar a eeuu de irak y de ampliar el acceso a la asistencia m dica

7561232 the convention isnt that important but it becomes important because so many people show up and no one wants to seem unimportant by staying home
7561233 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7561234 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
7561235 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7561236 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7561237 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7561238 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7561239 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7561240 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7561241 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

7561258 esto parece un paso atr s para obama quien el mes pasado ten a una ventaja del 51 por ciento al 44 por ciento
7561259 incluso la semana pasada justo antes de que eligiera a biden como su candidato a vicepresidente la mayor a de las encuestas mostraba a obama con una ventaja de un d gito sobre mccain
7561260 ive been watching for seven straight hours and there hasnt been a damn thing on
7561261 auf den ersten blick k nnte es scheinen als w rden die alten diskussionen um chancen und risiken von youtube oder myspace fortgef hrt das music on demand modell verfeinert noch einmal das illegale downloaden torpediert und abermals die erotik der nische entdeckt aber es hat sich in der branche etwas ge ndert und zwar fundamental man erkennt endlich den de facto zustand an was nicht unbedingt zu resignation f hrt sondern auch zu pragmatik
7561262 those amazing mormons the medias construction of latter day saints as a model minority
7561263 asian americans as the model minority an analysis of the popular press image in the 1960s and 1980s in

7561271 i was shocked by the news and obviously caught off guard having initially heard through one of my assistants his intent on friday night and then having it confirmed over the last 36 hours
7561272 he had a great summer in workouts and did well academically having said that we want people here who are completely committed to being part of our program our institution and our family we all wish trevor the best of luck
7561273 david is a tremendous young man who is extremely excited about becoming a ucf knight
7561274 he is a great addition to our program and we are pleased that he is now on board
7561275 one of the biggest frustrations i have is in site selection for some of these school projects
7561276 as architects we will spend up to two years locating a site that conforms to various initiatives and policies throughout the state not to mention the politics of working through site alternatives at the local level
7561277 with school consolidation there will be a tug of war as to where new facilities and expanded facilities will take place
7561278 if we can reduce the amount of time for some of these projects to come to fruition then we have a chance of lessening the impact of inflation and cost overruns
7561279 billions of dollars are being spent each year to retrofit renovate and build schools in america and yet these new designs are often based on outmoded concepts ignore special ecological principles and fail to include substantive client input
7561280 all stakeholders from students to community members must be involved in the planning and design of learning environments
7561281 if we can provide tifs and pre approved sites for creating jobs and business development why shouldnt we consider the same for our schools which are some of the largest construction projects in the state
7561282 that makes much more sense to me than stock school plans
7561283 these missile systems are intended to be used for testing and training purposes to simulate threats that may come from countries with ex soviet systems in their inventories
7561284 the missile systems were not purchased to be launched against perceived enemies and they will not be included in the inventory of the turkish armed forces tsk they will be tested at the konya range with ehts systems their radars and fire control systems are to be bought separately
7561285 mr challacombe singled out the clarence river for special attention
7561286 i believe our river is the focus of our valley
7561287 support greater efforts to reduce the amount of eastern water lost to the ocean and campaign for more in depth investigations into finding ways to turn this water inland
7561288 usually only one side will be anxious to isolate the determinative issue in the case and have that decided quickly the other side will have powerful reasons to avoid that being done
7561289 is to facilitate the just quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings
7561290 seems unlikely without a much more fundamental reform such as moving away from the adversarial system
7561291 550w powersupply with a 12v current rating of 40a based on a pc configured with an intel core2 extreme processor qx9650
7561292 theyre all really lucky to get out of there i think there was somebody on their side
7561293 they could smell the fuel so they didnt waste any time getting out
7561294 presentations are a glance media more closely related to billboards than other media ask yourself whether your message can be processed effectively within three seconds the audience should be able to quickly ascertain the meaning before turning their attention back to the presenter
7561295 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
7561296 im undefeated i told them i can retire now from international ball but lebron james threw out something i didnt like he said he wont play in 2012 unless im there
7561297 j kidd is going to become a player coach now
7561298 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7561299 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7561300 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7561301 having printer dots secretly scattered on everything you print which indelibly connect your print out to the printer it came from and even the time and date it was printed is a major privacy violation wherever you are
7561302 its even worse when those printers are being used by dissidents living under authoritarian regimes wasnt the printing press supposed to spread freedom not automatically finger enemies of the state
7561303 for as long as there has been currency there have been counterfeiters
7561304 many customers seek the protection of counterfeit detection particularly banking and financial institutions
7561305 weve reached a point where so much customer information is sold to third parties that most people have resigned themselves to this fact of life personally and professionally
7561306 i do wonder if the dots can be removed when hard drive erase on an imaging printing device is invoked
7561307 sorry but for security reasons i cannot discuss the details of the technology
7561308 such processing may give rise to the violation of fundamental human rights namely the right to privacy and private life
7561309 it also might violate the right to protection of personal data
7561310 printer manufacturers have voluntarily complied and voluntarily withheld information from their own customers
7561311 meaning that customers were voting that they would rather go some place and have their photos printed rather than trying to print them at home
7561312 you dont have to have absolutely perfect quality on the first version of the technology if you are aiming at the home and office
7561313 we print more are less conscientious about doing so and spend more time and money on reprinting documents seemingly lost in the piles of printed pages in print rooms or stowed away somewhere out of sight
7561314 however competitive pressures and the ever increasing complexity of operations are driving the need to streamline information organisation encompassing a range of processes and workflows
7561315 actively managing office printing can reduce spending by 10 per cent to 30 per cent while reaping environmental benefits
7561316 although most enterprises now recognise the problem few have the necessary information leadership funding and strategy to fully succeed
7561317 we need to find ways to integrate with these types of applications both to bring information into them and get it out again when needed
7561318 it is a matter of working closely with companies to understand how they work and then matching devices to those requirements remembering that requirements can vary from department to department and office to office
7561319 in the same way that you dont need to be a telecoms engineer to make a phone call we want to make it that simple to put data into applications and get it out
7561320 we can make it a one step process by using the touchscreen on an mfp
7561321 there is always going to be room for the printed page but we need to look at the whole challenge of managing information
7561322 its a matter of working with customers to ensure we provide them with the equipment they require
7561323 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7561324 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7561325 sen barack obama launched a four day tour of battleground states sunday to coincide with mondays opening of the democratic convention and its ambitious agenda of selling obama to a national audience presenting a forceful case against republican rival john mccain and unifying a party still recovering from a bruising primary

7561334 los angeles county has more homeless people estimated at roughly 73 000 on any given night than any other metropolis in the country it also has a topography in which dense urban areas frequently brush up against tiny pockets of wilderness for those without houses this landscape offers many opportunities for ingenious solutions aeries beneath bridges riverbed encampments ad hoc tree houses with million dollar views to the problem of where to sleep
7561335 inviting the world for a big party also shined an international spotlight on chinas dark corners and its lingering concerns about its surprisingly fragile political structure when the afterglow fades china will be faced with a host of problems that it has put off addressing
7561336 the world will remember chinas marvelous facilities the birds nest one of the most visually tantalizing stadiums in history the incredible water cube a building whose walls danced like our northern lights every evening and a passel of stadiums that were wonderfully built and unlike in athens nearly full every night and day but what of the people displaced by the chinese government forced to relocate to make room for all of these beautiful buildings where did they go
7561337 everyone agrees that the games were a technical success the venues beautiful and the competition exciting but debate continued as the games ended about whether the international olympic committee had honored the olympic spirit by awarding the games to a country led by an authoritarian government with little taste for dissent or transparency
7561338 former pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif says his pml n party is pulling out of the countrys multi party governing coalition

7561341 russias parliament voted unanimously to recognise the independence of georgias two breakaway regions today in a direct challenge to the west

7561343 israel has released 198 palestinian prisoners in what it calls a goodwill gesture to bolster palestinian leader mahmoud abbas
7561344 us secretary of state condoleezza rice acknowledged monday that it will be difficult to reach a year end target for an israeli palestinian peace deal but said the two sides and the united states remain committed to that goal

7561351 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7561352 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7561353 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7561354 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7561355 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7561356 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7561357 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7561358 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7561359 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7561360 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7561361 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7561362 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7561363 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7561364 some customers are saying they want to work with us to have a printer fleet managed by our software tools
7561365 others are saying they want us to take care of the whole thing and just give them a report at the end of each period the common thing across both groups is that they want more control
7561366 some staff will need to move from having personal devices to having utility rooms with a few larger machines
7561367 people can get a little territorial and it takes some time to explain the benefits of moving to this type of approach
7561368 they know they will only be paying for what they actually print
7561369 a lot of people just dont think about how much their printing is costing
7561370 research shows the total cost of printing and output can be about 5 per cent of a companys total turnover
7561371 in some cases this can be as much as the rent
7561372 it comes down to focus and putting your printing in the hands of someone who has that function as their core business
7561373 managed services allow specialised skills to come in look at all the printing inside a company and find the best way to get it under control
7561374 a lot of companies do the first step but then just sit around the table not sure what to do next
7561375 traditionally you would sign a customer on a contract for four or five years and then renegotiate at the end of that period
7561376 however with services you sit down with them at the end of each quarter to track progress and see what can be done to improve performance
7561377 rather than purchasing a printer or signing a long term lease equipment can be changed as requirements change
7561378 printing resources can grow as a companys demand for them grows
7561379 many times documents are printed when they could really be dealt with in digital form
7561380 we can work with customers to show them how to build systems that actually reduce the volume of paper in their organisation
7561381 the savings that can be made in organisations is significant
7561382 youll never get rid of paper totally but through efficient planning you can reduce the volume
7561383 the same approach can work for things like letterhead documents and forms
7561384 printing these things as needed means that lots of pre printed sheets wont go out of date and have to be thrown away
7561385 it might sound counter intuitive coming from a printing company but the more you reduce physical output the more benefits you get in cost and reducing the environmental impact
7561386 its true that you can always refill or recycle cartridges but not having anything to recycle is even better
7561387 there is little doubt that placing the responsibility on manufacturers for the collection and cost of recycling e waste will give them a strong incentive to design products that are easier to de manufacture consume fewer materials and reduce harmful content
7561388 xerox and hp have seen there is a need for tools for people who want to get a quick idea of their carbon footprint
7561389 where some would view this as a potential negative our experience has actually been that users welcome the opportunity to access new devices that are of higher quality offer more features and provide additional functionality even if the machines are a few steps away from their former device location
7561390 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7561391 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7561392 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7561393 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7561394 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7561395 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7561396 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7561397 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7561398 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7561399 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7561400 overall the business case for us was a no brainer
7561401 we knew we were spending a lot on printing but had no way of monitoring exactly how much and where it was being spent
7561402 we took the view that we should be replacing two devices with one and so opted for installing multifunction devices
7561403 these can handle faxing printing copying and even scanning in one device
7561404 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7561405 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7561406 weve been very keen to bring janos to the club he will provide valuable competition
7561407 i was thinking that if i played well against rangers i would have a chance to come here
7561408 this is a big opportunity for me and of course we want to get back into europe
7561409 as for economic spin offs from the new wfcu centre lescanec said anything which creates activity is beneficial
7561410 any time you can get 4 000 or 5 000 people to come down to an event that has to help
7561411 of course the colosseum has been a major change as well and theres clearly been a spike in attendance with the influx of 5 000 people on concert nights
7561412 i would say the majority are u s visitors but there has been an increase in our canadian clientele as well
7561413 it just makes me so angry that were missing such a huge opportunity if you want to revitalize your downtown you build things downtown
7561414 what marketing studies have been done wheres the business plan to show us this is even viable show us the goods
7561415 he confirmed in a phone interview that hes finalizing plans to tear down the sprawling 43 year old factory with demolition beginning as early as october and is working on long term development plans for the 60 acre site that could over the long haul exceed 500 000 square feet and would benefit from close proximity to the citys wfcu arena complex
7561416 it would complement the great work the city has done
7561417 i see mixed use commercial anything and everything we can build there we can do whatever i have to see what we can place next to it the arena if someone were to indicate an interest in buying a piece of that 60 acres farhi said he would consider it
7561418 theyre good people a great family i hope theyre going to take a good part of that looking forward
7561419 corporate space needs study and site condition assessment study for 350 city hall square to review the opportunity for consolidating various off site satellite administrative operations within a centralized campus environment with a view of creating a long term spatial program that is both efficient and effective while taking advantage of available corporate synergies
7561420 hes certainly not talking short term because theres no demand and it will not develop without demand

7561471 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7561472 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7561473 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7561474 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7561510 we built a brand new network because the network in place at the pepsi center could not handle the demand
7561511 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7561512 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure

7561518 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7561519 i am happy with senator biden joining our team i am not happy with the way team obama handled making this announcement
7561520 i did receive my text at 3 am while i was sleeping this morning all week i worked with the cell phone out on my desk how disappointing is this to go to sleep and have my boyfriend who did not sign up for the text call me at 5 30 with the news in full blast on the tv
7561521 the text messaging gimmick has me miffed the campaign gets this one free pass but dont use your supporters again to control the news cycle a message in the wee hours of saturday morning lame i expect better going forward
7561522 help me with the text message thing lets hear the first person lets call him oscar oscar tomorrow morning at ten after six gets a text message why doesnt he just call cnn and tell them who the vice presidential nominee is
7561523 well because you know he wont need to because all of us have signed up for the text message
7561524 i did get confirmation that i would be sent the message after i submitted my text initially
7561525 and i received another text in between asking me to sign up for notices about local events so i was definitely on their list the biden text just never arrived
7561526 barackobama i did not get a text message re joe biden i had to find out on cnn com so much for circumventing mainstream media barry
7561527 verizon wireless never sent me the vp text message from the obama campaign this morning
7561528 this disappointed me of course because im a political junkie and signed up for delivery within minutes of the campaigns first announcement of the event
7561529 i am a full time artist who wants to do something good before i die if my art doesnt have a big impact on the world which given the odds is more likely to happen at least i want my children to remember me as someone who was happy to spend some time on planet earth
7561530 but he is in the situation where he cant hit back which jackie robinson could not do he had to be able to run the bases even though the crowd was jeering the first african american on the field
7561531 he has to keep smiling because no one wants an angry african american in the white house
7561532 when they have a camera put in their faces they will have an opportunity to put their arm around our guy so that he can run the bases
7561533 hillary clinton will have a pee wee reese moment bill clinton will have a pee wee reese moment ed rendell will have a pee wee reese moment
7561534 got to show hes able to hit hes got to show hes capable of running the bases thats whether the rubber meets the road
7561535 he doesnt know where he is at any given moment
7561536 what does barack obama have to do to convince clinton supporters that hes capable of being president of the united states
7561537 you want to speak fine you want to speak bill fine you want to be vice president no beyond that what else can i do what do you want me to do
7561538 provide a new era for america to assert its leadership in the world
7561539 even jesus christ himself might not be able to respond
7561540 i think we have really missed the boat in this campaign on covering race
7561541 i look at how quick we were to jump on the language of post racial the language of race transcendence thats not possible yet in america
7561542 will be a redefinition of politics in america it will be a redefinition of the democratic party
7561543 to the extent that he continues to meet with people let them look him in the eye shake hands let them ask him a question answer that question
7561544 there is no connection between receiving gods forgiveness and the doing of good deeds
7561545 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
7561546 moreover brethren i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you which also you received and in which you stand by which also you are saved if you hold fast that word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen by cephas then by the twelve

7561554 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7561555 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7561556 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7561557 michelle wrote her own stump speech and you know shes refining it now i think as were going into the general election
7561558 we have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver so shes really working on it as we speak
7561559 some people will see confidence and others might see cockiness i think some people will see strength others might see arrogance
7561560 she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with

7561562 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7561563 what i was clearly talking about is that i am proud in how americans are engaging in the political process

7561565 i am proud of my country i dont know about you if you heard those words earlier i am very proud of my country
7561566 good preview of how republicans will attack michelle suggesting that she does not share american values mining a subtext of race
7561567 considering there are so many issues legitimate issues that you can use on barack obama to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidity of the highest level
7561568 mr obama is going to come to his wifes defense and its going to humanize both of them
7561569 there is less information about him to temper her comments against so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record
7561570 were trusting that the american voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making peoples lives better
7561571 i also think these folks should lay off my wife
7561572 as school starts up again its time to acknowledge that the lure of visual media isnt the only thing pushing our kids away from the page and toward the screen weve shied away from discussing a most unfortunate culprit in the saga of diminishing teen reading the high school english classroom ill never forget what one parent bemoaning his daughters aversion to great books after she took ap english literature wrote to me what ive seen teachers do is take living breathing works of art and transform them into dessicated lab specimens fit for dissection when students have to produce an essay on a book they care nothing for it becomes a nightmare for both the student think all nighter and the teacher wholl spend precious weekend hours reading papers devoid of content the upshot of this empty drill teens increasingly resistant to great books

7561581 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
7561582 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

7561638 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7561639 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7561640 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time

7561642 theres no evidence of listeria contamination in our products beyond the production lines originally under investigation

7561646 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7561647 but once we were aware of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7561648 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7561683 the constitutive theory is merely a theoretical construct as it has neither been codified by treaty nor widely recognized in international law most modern authorities reject the constitutive theory of statehood citing among other reasons that it leads to subjectivity in the notion of the state another problem is that recognition even majority recognition is not binding on third states in international law

7561708 i would like to make it clear that springbok coach peter de villiers his management team and playing squad have my unequivocal backing and that of the south african rugby union presidents council and of the board of sa rugby pty ltd
7561709 although we share and understand the frustration and disappointment of supporters speculation about the coachs future is pointless
7561710 the two most disappointed people in south africa today are in fact peter de villiers and captain victor matfield and we know they will be doing everything in their power to achieve victory at coca cola park in johannesburg on saturday
7561711 and let me put an end to speculation that the post tri nations review will in some way be pivotal to the future of the coach that is not the case it is an entirely normal quarterly review such as every springbok coach has undergone
7561712 learn a lot quicker than you are at the moment or you will have a short term job
7561713 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way
7561714 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7561715 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally an d this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7561716 what they do demand is that you must be fitter and play better from un structured ball
7561717 but you dont need to go to a harum scarum type of game
7561718 but south africa have gone to the other extreme theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7561719 they could turn it around even in 7 days 20it will be tough but they are a resilient bunch of players some of the toughest footballers i have ever been involved with
7561720 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesn t fit these players its not credible you have got to give players a framework to work under peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7561721 michelle obama one on one i am absolutely proud of my country
7561722 i have said and will continue to say that i am absolutely proud of my country and in no other place in this country could my story be possible i mean thats you know i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had um you know we are who americans were supposed to be

7561732 bidens foreign policy expertise fills some holes in obamas resume
7561733 no one is for partition unless of course youre an iranian backed political party because theyd love to have a self governing zone in the south that effectively would become an extension of iran
7561734 will lend a certain credibility to the democratic tickets discussion of the war
7561735 sixty five years old biden is a familiar face in washington he served in the senate for three decades amassing deep foreign policy experience as chairman of the foreign relations committee as a catholic and a native of scranton pennsylvania his political appeal extends to the working class voters obama has struggled to attract
7561736 bidens foreign policy expertise fills some holes in obamas resume and hes scrappy
7561737 in mr biden mr obama selected a six term senator from delaware best known for his expertise on foreign affairs mr biden spent last weekend in georgia as that nation engaged in a tense confrontation with russia but also for his skills at political combat

7561761 i had spent a wonderful day wandering paris a sunday so i greatly enjoyed seeing and hearing buskers from a man who seemed able to play several instruments at once to a group who played folk tunes and danced with bystanders i was a little lost in st germaine in a narrow lane when i heard the most beautiful music i looked around to see which window it was coming from only to realise it was two girls busking at the end of the alley their voices intertwined and soared i felt unable to move as i stood there listening gradually a crowd gathered and started applauding each song the singing was so beautiful and moving that even though i couldnt understand the french lyrics i stood there with tears running down my face the twenty minutes i stood listening to these girls was the highlight of my six days in paris
7561762 so now if joe biden goes on the attack against john mccain isnt he going to come off sounding like just another politician who will do and say anything to get elected
7561763 can you take me through that warning who had the talk with joe biden
7561764 well but as communications director its your job to manage the message now coming out of both of these candidates so wouldnt you have been involved in that discussion
7561765 will take his central message of change you can believe in to more than 70 000 at invesco field
7561766 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7561767 i had spent a wonderful day wandering paris a sunday so i greatly enjoyed seeing and hearing buskers from a man who seemed able to play several instruments at once to a group who played folk tunes and danced with bystanders i was a little lost in st germaine in a narrow lane when i heard the most beautiful music i looked around to see which window it was coming from only to realise it was two girls busking at the end of the alley their voices intertwined and soared i felt unable to move as i stood there listening gradually a crowd gathered and started applauding each song the singing was so beautiful and moving that even though i couldnt understand the french lyrics i stood there with tears running down my face the twenty minutes i stood listening to these girls was the highlight of my six days in paris
7561768 our results offer a new strategy for classifying stem cells by their molecular machinery
7561769 we show that pluripotence and self renewal are under tight control by specific molecular networks
7561770 we use these tools every day and recognize that technology is one of the keys to maximizing our opportunity to grow
7561771 microsoft is proud that our technology can help technoserve realize its potential
7561772 we believe that technology is an enabler and that organizations like technoserve are demonstrating that it can be applied in innovative ways across wide networks to drive positive social change
7561773 im totally for getting behind grass roots reform but whats the reform and how is it going to work
7561774 it felt like to me it wasnt a partnership it was a takeover
7561775 frankly our job was to make sure people know what this was about we expected people to leave
7561776 the thing about the partnership is its an unknown theres no track record
7561777 even though its called a partnership how can you call it a partnership and exclude the administrators
7561778 sure i made the decision to leave but what else am i going to do
7561779 you have to have a good working relationship with your supervisor
7561780 what is important in school reform is that leadership is in sync with one another from the superintendent to the principals to the teachers
7561781 as long as senior management and the principals are in sync you have a much better chance for real change to benefit students thats the bottom line
7561782 what were trying to create is a completely new model and yes the role of administrators is different because they no longer make the ultimate decision
7561783 we dont want teachers who are not going to buy into this to be forced into anything
7561784 i cant imagine any organization that would just give itself over to the employees and say go do it
7561785 this is my 18th year in education and will be one of the more exciting years in my career
7561786 i think the concern ought to be are people ready to take over leadership roles at those institutions
7561787 its not just an issue of if theyre new its about what experience they have
7561788 we would essentially double the progress we have made over the past five years
7561789 the goals are ambitious but they are still a concept we can wrap our arms around
7561790 the federal government is still going to hold us to the 89 percent standard by 2013
7561791 but we cant meet that just by saying we are going to we have to have a goal that we believe in
7561792 the better the scores the more difficult it is to make those gains
7561793 when the top kids scores go up the bottom kids go up much faster
7561794 students possessing or threatening others with any weapon dangerous instrument or imitation firearm are subject to suspension and or expulsion in accordance with law board policy and administrative regulations
7561795 the good news is that in chico its not a cookie cutter approach
7561796 do students know if they bring a squirt gun to school they could be expelled
7561797 we think the resolution of assurances is pretty much a non starter for us
7561798 if this is a set of demands that are not acceptable to the district and theres no room to negotiate its going to be very hard to forge a solution here
7561799 its a little shady to me how that can even be possible
7561800 but there are not a lot of specific numbers because diabetes among children is not always reported
7561801 i always called the school to check and see how things were going
7561802 omg why on earth did i buy the freaking juicy
7561803 right now you want people to be spending not cutting back
7561804 crunch why do i feel so squeezed and other unsolved economic mysteries
7561805 even if they had the latest software the students were still resistant to use the dinosaur
7561806 this is a brand new computer lab just for us and we are going to use it every day
7561807 if we didnt have these computers we would be in a standstill
7561808 one of the challenges our schools faced was we didnt have the speed and capacity to allow much data to move through the system
7561809 now when a fourth grade teacher is going over the california gold rush the teacher can go online and show a clip on gold mining
7561810 this was a huge undertaking for the district and we approached it in a two pronged way
7561811 we have a cyclical allocation system to replace equipment for the next 20 years so about every five years we will have money for the upgrades
7561812 sadly that position was wiped out but we are hoping to restructure
7561813 we struggle with updating our computer systems and we are usually a platform behind
7561814 we need to reach out to the community and call attention to businesses to help fill those funding gaps
7561815 the community needs to be true partners in the education of students
7561816 we need more current computers but the issue is having the resources to do what we need to do you have to come up with the money somehow and finding that in the budget is the age old problem
7561817 one of the things we want to emphasize is that this the technology plan is not a static document
7561818 technology changes so quickly and we have to go back and re examine our resources its such a huge budget drain and you really need everyone including parents teachers and students involved in the conversation
7561819 el agua de los piletones se est evaporando y esto deja las tortugas al descubierto que son atacadas por los chicos por eso ante la falta de respuestas de organismos que se hab an comprometido con su rescate decidimos con mi novia y otra chica que nos ayud encarar esta tarea por nuestra cuenta

7561832 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste

7561834 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7561835 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something

7561857 gambari siempre aprovech la oportunidad de tomarse una foto con suu kyi para dar la impresi n de que el proceso de di logo pol tico que lidera en nombre de la onu est funcionando

7561860 a diferencia gambari aun san suu kyi se niega a ser un t tere en el juego de la junta esto confirma que perdi la confianza en gambari ella ha dicho esto a trav s de la nica forma de resistencia pac fica que tiene disponible

7561939 n o se trata de um procedimento cosm tico mas do tratamento para um transtorno o que justifica o comprometimento do sus o modo de fazer com que essas pessoas se situem melhor na sociedade e tenham enfim uma sensa o de pertencimento
7561940 o que chamamos de transtorno de identidade de sexo est relacionado com a forma como a pessoa se percebe
7561941 n o se reconhece no corpo no universo relacionado com seu g nero de nascen a
7561942 e isso n o tem nada a ver por exemplo com o homossexualismo que uma quest o de orienta o sexual
7561943 the means to get more players in is there that has been established we have a number of situations that could be resolved in the next few days
7561944 we want to bring in good players to complement those already here that is what we are trying to do in the remaining part of the window
7561945 when you are a young striker with great talent you will always be judged by goals i congratulated him on playing well in the first 45 minutes but i said he needed to make his mark in the game
7561946 thankfully that is what he did i thought it was a great strike and he was a handful all afternoon for the opposition he was up against players with a lot more experience than him but still had an impact on the game
7561947 all strikers want to score their first goal and he has been able to do that we are delighted for him
7561948 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 per cent advantage last month
7561949 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7561950 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7561951 the number of clinton democrats who say they would votefor mccain has gone up 11points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7561959 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled mr sharif said in islamabad
7561960 potentially political masterstroke saying there was every chance that he could defeat mr zardari
7561961 hes finally called zardaris bluff hes nominated someone who is highly regarded and theres every chance now that zardari assuming he maintains his candidacy will be defeated
7561962 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand mr zardari said in his first statement since being nominated for the presidency by the ppp

7561998 there remains a limit to the available talent that can be hired to pursue the rapid increase in interactive marketing communications programs that customers are demanding

7562004 i dont think so ive come into a different cycle since i decided not to do any more films
7562005 ive a feeling there is something cooking i dont know what it is yet
7562006 i realised after 70 years that my first big break was when i was five i learned to read and write so that for me was the break
7562007 its a bit blurred now it depends on the deal i cant answer that question ive never thought about it
7562008 our fans and concertgoers are incredibly digitally savvy but theyre also incredibly socially active they want a place to bring the two together this is the perfect synthesis of music online networking and face to face fun
7562009 i want the performance to go from one to many to many to many
7562010 young people online are sharing content and issues that are important to their lives

7562018 we moeten wel de realiteit onder ogen blijven zien ik denk dat iedereen het rekensommetje wel kan maken resultaten zoals vorig kwartaal kunnen we niet te lang volhouden we hebben wel iets langer dan een paar kwartalen maar daar wil ik het niet op aan laten komen
7562019 hoewel intel het doet voorkomen dat het een fundamenteel betere benadering heeft is dat niet het geval zij zeggen niet welke aannames zij hebben gedaan zij praten over schaalbaarheid maar gaan daarbij voorbij aan de bandbreedte voor geheugen zoals intel het voorstelt ziet het er erg goed uit maar de firma heeft een half dozijn zaken over het hoofd gezien
7562020 theres always a bit of fire when theres smoke around for sure
7562021 but to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it a tad too far
7562022 to send him out half busted when the game wasnt on the line would be an unintelligent thing to do as a coach you guys sometimes make up some stuff thats just rubbish honestly
7562023 you need to stop chasing controversy and watch the games and enjoy the games
7562024 theres a lot of good teams in the competition so if we start believing that we aint going to be doing what we need to do
7562025 im not quite sure where thats come from manly have been a really consistent side all year and we only got them by six points two weeks ago
7562026 we arent thinking along those lines we never have and we never will
7562027 every side i suppose apart from manly is looking and asking how do we get up there above them
7562028 the game has evolved from year to year and melbourne has been one of those sides that has taken it to another level
7562029 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7562030 we delayed his entry obviously and referred to the blokes who had a background in test rugby with the initial replacement option
7562031 but when timana got into the game he did well that was my first instinct he did really well
7562032 well have a look at the footage and pore over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7562033 theres no doubt he tahu can start a test he is perfectly capable of that as are all of them
7562034 hopefully if i get a spot we can get another good win
7562035 as long as i get a spot in the 22 and we are winning games its all great fun
7562036 i see myself as a 13 but stirling is the captain and he had a great game last saturday
7562037 when i train i learn a lot of roles i trained for fullback this week but i didnt play there i got on the wing i feel comfortable in a lot of positions
7562038 if i can slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline its a bonus for me
7562039 i was pretty happy obviously a bit surprised to get on that early
7562040 i felt i was ready and i got in the game straight away
7562041 ive always enjoyed playing over here i think ive only lost one game in my two years at the force and now australia
7562042 i love playing here ive had nothing but good experiences that win against the springboks was one of the best experiences ive had since i came across to rugby
7562043 theyre what we would call a dead end host because if a cat becomes infected theres a good chance it would die
7562044 dogs are a possibility as well nothing can be ruled in or out at this stage
7562045 bats are the natural reservoir of hendra virus theres no doubt about it
7562046 but it doesnt make sense to control the population because they are so widespread what we really need to do is develop strategies to prevent the virus spreading from bats to horses
7562047 no one left without a very firm idea about what a great bloke ben was
7562048 one of the things horse owners need to be doing is disinfecting everything around the horses including all surfaces where liquid may settle
7562049 it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7562050 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said theyd be strongly defending the allegations its a slightly different situation
7562051 certainly if theres a full admission then clubs are able to act more quickly than otherwise
7562052 if the allegations are proven then of course his future in the club and in the game will come into question
7562053 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and id say its highly unlikely hed be playing again this year
7562054 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do before any further action is determined
7562055 theyre very disappointed but were basically at the 30km mark of a marathon and were not going back to the starting blocks

7562179 after seeing obama defend infanticide with the glib excuse that the question of when life begins is above his

7562236 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7562237 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7562238 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7562239 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7562240 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7562241 en las relaciones entre rusia y la alianza atl ntica se deber considerar las consecuencias de la operaci n militar que rusia llev a cabo en georgia pero estamos convencidos de que ser a un error suspender contactos entre rusia y la otan en un momento en que existe tanta necesidad de mantenerlos
7562242 dan tidaklah seseorang mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan suatu amalan yang lebih aku cintai daripada amalan amalan yang ku wajibkan
7562243 barang siapa yang shalat karena allah selama empat puluh hari dengan berjamaah dan selalu mendapatkan takbiratul ihram imam akan dituliskan baginya dua jaminan surat kebebasan bebas dari api neraka dan dari nifaq
7562244 carilah lailatul qadar pada malam malam ganjil dari sepuluh hari terakhir bulan ramadhan
7562245 demi allah aku mengetahuinya lailatul qadar perkiraan saya yang paling kuat dia jatuh pada malam yang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memerintahkan kami untuk bangun malam di dalamnya yaitu malam dua puluh tujuh
7562246 barang siapa yang ingin mencarinya lailatul qadar hendaklah ia mencarinya pada tujuh malam terakhir dari bulan ramadhan
7562247 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam jika memasuki sepuluh terakhir ramadhan beliau mengencangkan ikat pinggangnya menghidupkan malamnya dan membangunkan keluarganya
7562248 sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan batas akhir bagi amal seorang mukmin melainkan ajalnya
7562249 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam merupakan orang yang paling dermawan dan beliau lebih dermawan sekali di bulan ramadhan
7562250 alangkah buruknya tingkah mereka mereka tidak mengenal allah melainkan hanya di bulan ramadhan
7562251 barang siapa yang berpuasa ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan mengharapkan pahala maka akan dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampuni
7562252 betapa banyak orang berpuasa yang hanya memetik lapar dan dahaga
7562253 dalam menyambut kedatangan musim musim ibadah seorang hamba sangat membutuhkan bimbingan bantuan dan taufik dari allah taala cara meraih itu semua adalah dengan bertawakal kepada nya
7562254 padahal mereka tidaklah diperintahkan melainkan supaya beribadah kepada allah dengan mengikhlaskan ketaatan kepada nya
7562255 barang siapa yang mengamalkan suatu amalan yang tidak ada perintahnya dari kami maka amalan itu akan tertolak
7562256 hai fulan kau telah berbuat begini dan begitu kau telah berpuasa ramadhan kau telah shalat malam di bulan suci kau telah menunaikan amalan ini dan itu dengan sempurna
7562257 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka para manusia dari jalan mu yang lurus kemudian saya akan mendatangi mereka dari muka dan dari belakang mereka dari kanan dan dari kiri mereka
7562258 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaubatlah kepada allah dengan taubat yang semurni murninya mudah mudahan rabb kamu akan menghapuskan kesalahan kesalahanmu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam surga yang mengalir di bawahnya sungai sungai
7562259 setiap keturunan adam itu banyak melakukan dosa dan sebaik baik orang yang berdosa adalah yang bertaubat
7562260 barang siapa yang tidak meninggalkan kata kata dusta dan perbuatannya maka niscaya allah tidak akan membutuhkan penahanan dirinya dari makanan dan minuman tidak membutuhkan puasanya
7562261 seandainya kamu berpuasa maka hendaknya pendengaranmu penglihatanmu dan lisanmu turut berpuasa dari dusta dan hal hal haram dan janganlah kamu menyakiti tetangga bersikap tenang dan berwibawalah di hari puasamu janganlah kamu jadikan hari puasamu dan hari tidak berpuasamu sama
7562262 inilah ketakwaan yang sejati adapun mencampur adukkan antara ketaatan dan kemaksiatan maka ini tidak masuk dalam bingkai takwa meski dibarengi dengan amalan amalan sunnah
7562263 kewajiban orang yang berpuasa adalah menahan diri dari hal hal mubah dan hal hal yang terlarang mengekang diri dari makanan minuman dan jima hubungan suami istri ini sebenarnya hanya sekedar menahan diri dari hal hal mubah yang diperbolehkan sementara itu ada hal hal terlarang yang tidak boleh kita langgar baik di bulan ramadhan maupun di bulan lainnya di bulan suci ini tentunya larangan tersebut menjadi lebih tegas maka sungguh sangat mengherankan kondisi orang yang berpuasa menahan diri dari hal hal yang pada dasarnya diperbolehkan seperti makan dan minum kemudian dia tidak berpuasa menahan diri dan tidak berpaling dari perbuatan perbuatan yang diharamkan di sepanjang zaman seperti ghibah mengadu domba mencaci mencela mengumpat dan lain lain semua ini merontokkan ganjaran puasa
7562264 por lo que le pas a lafita desgraciadamente se abri una oportunidad para m y la estoy afrontando con la ilusi n de ganarme la titularidad poco a poco todos somos conscientes de que la competencia est m s fuerte este a o que el pasado y nadie se quiere quedar fuera
7562265 desde m punto de vista aqu no hay once mejores todos tenemos calidad es una plantilla muy buena y no se puede hablar de un s lo once
7562266 nos jugamos mucho en estos dos partidos igual no tanto en el de liga porque es el inicio y todav a faltar a mucho pero s por el rival al que nos enfrentamos de todas formas estamos pensando en el jueves en el pase a la uefa todos estamos muy ilusionados y queremos seguir con ese sue o europeo del que tanto hablamos
7562267 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7562268 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s al f tbol europeo so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos en mi segundo a o aqu estoy a un pasito de jugar en europa y todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7562269 escuchaba que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7562270 ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal pueda darse un partido bueno para nosotros con m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7562271 no es nada nuevo ni sorprendente que un equipo como el real madrid haya sacado adelante un partido como el de la supercopa porque tiene grandes figuras somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor
7562272 they didnt have anyone else who was knocking at their door
7562273 should be known by what the founder teaches stands for
7562274 not everybody is very interested in spiritual practices and becoming very staunch some are interested in culture others food
7562275 it is a relief because usually in these situations it comes down to the players at the last minute to make the decision
7562276 however in this case the ecb and the icc have come up with the sensible decision a lot can happen between now and then but at the moment the concerns were the security there
7562277 but a lot can happen in a year and we can then take it from there
7562278 playing for arsenal would be the biggest achievement in my life
7562279 there are lots of young footballers but amongst the best european clubs only one work like they do i love it
7562280 djibril will be one of the top scorers in the premier league i know it
7562281 it is great for him to be at sunderland and great for the premier league to have him
7562282 this is the worlds best league and he can show everyone now how good he is
7562283 this is the new sunderland and we know what we can achieve
7562284 i think our performances have shown why we can believe in having a great season
7562285 i am happy to be part of the committee especially being an east end boy as i am
7562286 i am looking forward to the regeneration of excitement back into sport in east london i know how passionate the area is for football
7562287 2012 is not about the opening ceremony or whether london can better beijings i dont think that it should be about whether we can better the opening ceremony
7562288 we will see what is going to happen but having another winger would permit us to play with three guys up front which would be good for the balance of the team
7562289 i have been trying to talk about the positives but some people are more concerned about the negative aspects if there are any
7562290 the means to get more players in is there that has been established we have a number of situations that could be resolved in the next few days
7562291 we want to bring in good players to complement those already here that is what we are trying to do in the remaining part of the window
7562292 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7562293 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7562294 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7562295 because itll broaden your mind and make you think more critically
7562296 you know that every time theres an interruption to the democratic system the au automatically condemns it
7562297 what we hope is that we can quickly find a way out of the crisis thats what were here for
7562298 you dont just seek a solution through threats do you understand that
7562299 going back to a situation where the constitution plays a role
7562300 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7562301 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7562302 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7562303 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7562304 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7562305 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7562306 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7562307 the books will be launched on sept 22 weve asked the national education ministry to help publicize the event
7562308 for the kindergarten level we emphasize on using children stories fables and even child games such as puzzles and the snake and ladder board game in teaching anti corruption values
7562309 it is our hope that students can do a research on how public services are being carried out in their neighborhood and to discuss it in classes
7562310 weve so far only focused our attention on officials caught for graft when education and the cultivation of an anti corruption culture is part and parcel of corruption erradication
7562311 and they tore their hair put on sack cloth and sprinkled ashes on their heads
7562312 catastrophe over one million are cut off from food supplies and from the other modes and mechanisms of daily life
7562313 oh dear the french and soiux have declared war on eachother

7562317 the majority of those internal migrants went to urban areas the consequence is that gauteng has 639 informal settlements it is followed by kwazulu natal 618 and the eastern cape 416
7562318 a study commissioned by the department of housing has revealed that between 1996 and 2001 5 5 million people migrated across south africa
7562319 both cross border and internal migrants establish themselves in informal settlements most of them have no jobs and live in squalor while others are drawn into crime to make a living
7562320 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
7562321 under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits
7562322 it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
7562323 around eight ships have been seized but we believe there were no fatalities
7562324 there was a shoot out at one of the ships but it was a quarrel between the gunmen
7562325 these pirates are not afraid to use significant firepower in attempts to bring vessels under their control
7562326 very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7562327 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet he has written a text book on cyber law in new zealand
7562328 we are all people and thats what happens to people
7562329 they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7562330 during my days off i have to drive him around in this little golf cart which he calls a tractor its really funny
7562331 deacon wants to be a pizza delivery boy not that there is anything wrong with that but its hard to see how it could be a career as such
7562332 my eight year old daughter ava wants to be a scientist but they are both at the stage where it changes from one week to the next
7562333 lo encontr en el parking de sir pizza se lo ve a muy nervioso pas para encargar pizza para sus hijas
7562334 dejando de lado que el t rmino testigo protegido no es atribuido al gobierno de estados unidos lo que hace dif cil cumplir una eventual obligaci n el t rmino testigo protegido fue utilizado por el abogado de dur n citando a funcionarios argentinos el juez va demasiado lejos
7562335 es impugnar el testimonio de antonini afirmando que estados unidos a cambio de la asistencia posterg su extradici n a la argentina
7562336 estados unidos no hace comentarios sobre la existencia o no de un pedido de extradici n
7562337 entre otras cosas hablar n de las mujeres que ten a en uruguay y en buenos aires y de c mo antonini conspir con otros de sus socios y piloto de los aviones vladimir abad para sacar a dur n de los negocios que ten an en miami

7562339 mtv has just launched a groundbreaking competition called untold stories with a chance to not only get on mtv but also win a trip to india
7562340 the stories each convey a specific awareness message and have been purposely left unfinished leaving you to decide how they end
7562341 the winner will also win a trip to india to present their finished film
7562342 there are over 33 million people living with hiv around the world 90 of whom dont know theyre infected
7562343 today the parliament was doing the paperwork on what has happened de facto russia has formally acknowledged that it is a protector of south ossetia and abkhazia
7562344 the parliament is so dependent on the kremlin that i am sure it was ordered by medvedevs administration to back the independence bids
7562345 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7562346 i am positive that europe and the u s will respond in a reasonable manner the u s economic situation is not good russia is on the rise
7562347 it created a competition between the two sides with one side trying to deal with these conflicts and the other wanting to blow them up
7562348 we have to state once again that russia has never given its consent to a replacement of russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone with
7562349 it was a vote of strategic significance for modern history
7562350 russia has shown that it feels responsible for the security in the region and adopted a role of the guardian of contemporary international law
7562351 what theyre doing is annexing parts of an emerging european democracy
7562352 this will only increase russias international isolation the russians are shooting themselves in the foot
7562353 we have managed to shift the burning of bodies on a mound that is still above the water level
7562354 if it rains again we will have no choice but to start cremation of dead bodies on embankments and on the road
7562355 we had made safety arrangements in areas more prone to flooding but floods hit other places
7562356 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7562357 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7562358 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7562359 the department of state urges u s citizens in georgia to exercise caution while traveling
7562360 our husbands decided to stay in the village with the children
7562361 after harvest we sold the produce in the market and bought cattle
7562362 we came to addis ababa expecting to get a better life
7562363 sometimes the residents give us some food but sometimes we sleep hungry
7562364 one reason for the urban food crisis is the huge gap between demand and supply
7562365 the demand is increasing beyond expectation while the supply is less
7562366 increases in staple food prices are coming at a time of already high and extreme levels of food insecurity in some regions
7562367 at the same time livestock prices and labour rates have increased only minimally further reducing the overall purchasing power of poor and very poor households
7562368 when local production fails to feed the people one looks at global markets
7562369 but despite ethiopias move to import food from the international market the prices are still not affordable to urban dwellers
7562370 the global situation has affected the response not the problem
7562371 the problem remains the increasing population and poor farming methods there has to be emphasis on helping people to recover
7562372 previously farmers brought their products and sold to wholesalers without prefixed price
7562373 now unless they get a buyer at their price they wait for a good offer
7562374 i came to freedom park in 1990 from vosloorus a township east of johannesburg because my brother is working here at the mine
7562375 here we are mixed weve got legal and illegal peoples from mozambique swaziland lesotho and those without south african ids identity documents cant get rdp houses or disability grants
7562376 i think the others they havent got family at home to support them so they find a friend and they say lets go to rustenberg were going to work
7562377 others dont have money to buy stock so they can sell something so they get four to five boyfriends to get money to buy water paraffin and clothes and to go back to home in the rural areas for big days holidays
7562378 the main problem is that when youve got a boyfriend that boyfriend is not your husband because he has a wife at home so when you get ill he just runs away and leaves you in the shack
7562379 i found out i was positive in 1998 when i had tb tuberculosis
7562380 tapologo a community centred hiv aids programme run by the catholic church was wanting some caregivers so i joined because i wanted knowledge about hiv and aids and i saw most people here in freedom park were dying alone in the shacks
7562381 our patients are afraid to disclose to their boyfriends because theyre afraid the boyfriend will run away so they continue to spread the virus
7562382 when we find a patient is living alone we bathe the patient we cook porridge for them if they cant do it and we clean the house
7562383 if the patient has a family we teach the family how to give the patient treatment and we educate them about reactions to the medication most of my patients recover and say no more rustenberg we are going home
7562384 that time eish it was so dangerous we slept outside and when it rained we slept under plastic
7562385 there was no job i was selling cold drinks and liquor to people at the mines
7562386 they come here thinking that theyre going to get a job but theres no jobs
7562387 if they dont have money to buy stock so as to sell something they get four to five boyfriends to get money to buy water paraffin and clothes
7562388 so when you get ill he just runs away and leaves you in the shack
7562389 there were many people suffering in this place no money to go to hospital and if its raining no car could get in and take them so people were dying inside the houses
7562390 the stigma and the discrimination were dreadful the caregivers were in danger and women were getting beaten up on their way to the clinic we had to close down for six months at one time because lives were being threatened
7562391 but that team of home carers they kept at it and its very different now
7562392 theres only one government place in the whole of this area rustenberg hospital that provides art and the extremely poor cant afford to go there
7562393 so a community programme like ours which is in the settlements so that the people can reach it thats our idea
7562394 if youre a contractor they dont help you at the mine
7562395 i knew this clinic tapologo because everyone who comes to it is alive
7562396 they focused on the mine workers and financially empowered tapologo to reach out to the communities
7562397 theres no way women are going to be saved from a certain death in this area unless theyre economically empowered
7562398 i just slept with women without condoms so thats why i got this disease
7562399 transnet does not own the land within those boundaries we do not own the land from blouberg strand to robben island and from robben island to the green point lighthouse and under the sea
7562400 and if we dont own the land we cannot possibly have sold it to anyone foreign or local and thats just the basic reality of life
7562401 the sale agreement does not contain any warranties or undertakings in favour of lexshell in relation to the reclamation of land nor does it contain any warranties or undertakings in relations to the anticipated development of the v amp a waterfront
7562402 so where this r20 billion number comes from in the sunday times i suppose only the sunday times and its journalists would know
7562403 the story is definitely true and transnet knows that the story is true
7562404 if they intend to sue well be ready the facts are there
7562405 we wouldnt have sold it to anybody but the highest bidder
7562406 no one had a second chance you put in your bid and that was it
7562407 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 percent over the last four years in comparison with the aids related deaths we had in 2003 2004 because of increased free treatment
7562408 she tried her best to get to it to the point of actually pulling and breaking chains
7562409 principalmente porque con la figura de comodato todos los bienes y accesorios que se realicen en el bien finalmente van a seguir siendo propiedad del ayuntamiento
7562410 que es muy importante porque tendr voz y voto para la toma de decisiones respecto al estadio
7562411 no podemos dejar de lado aquellos gloriosos tiempos en donde el equipo de los leones negros de la udeg eran reconocidos a nivel nacional y que con su desaparici n de la primera divisi n aficionados a oran su regreso
7562412 y si se va chivas queda en una situaci n financiera dif cil
7562413 el voto es igualito para todos y si chivas se retira y se pone sobre la mesa la venta renta o demolici n del estadio podremos decir un no
7562414 es mejor licitar y es lo que la ley dice no digo no a la universidad sino que compita como cualquier otra figura jur dica o persona moral en la licitaci n sobre todo porque no veo el beneficio de la ciudad y la ciudad est por encima de la universidad por eso creo que est mal y de hecho el planteamiento que se hace de origen est mal est viciado
7562415 de esto no sabemos nada el dictamen del presidente de la comisi n de planeaci n no lo indica
7562416 legalmente conveniente que la concesi n del estacionamiento se realice de manera abierta a todos los posibles interesados para que el municipio reciba una contraprestaci n o beneficio pues de lo contrario estar amos regalando el usufructo de un bien municipal
7562417 no sabemos ni cu nto va a invertir lo nico que s sabemos es que se har un hotel pero lo de la ludoteca y biblioteca no es seguro
7562418 in any case its the best phone ive ever had and im loving it
7562419 i will step in and defend when a teacher or school is being unfairly sued
7562420 there will be an administrative process that will make sure a teachers action is supported by the school board and once the board backs a teacher we will defend that teacher in court
7562421 by avoiding the cost of litigation schools can best focus on the appropriate disciplinary actions so that teachers can restore order in the classroom
7562422 vorrei cogliere questa occasione per scusarmi per il disturbo causato siamo davvero scioccati per quanto accaduto
7562423 make peoples lives a little bit better by putting clothes on dogs
7562424 visions of what will happen when human and dog styling become one
7562425 although we share and understand the frustration and disappointment of supporters speculation about the coachs future is pointless
7562426 the two most disappointed people in south africa today are in fact peter de villiers and captain
7562427 and let me put an end to speculation that the post vodacom tri nations review will in some way be pivotal to the future of the coach that is not the case it is an entirely normal quarterly review such as every springbok coach has undergone
7562428 thats it the cycle just continues and or gets worse
7562429 well at least there is some sort of normal love for them

7562440 aan het begin van de avond waren we eindelijk bij ons huisje op 20 meter van het strand en het was er gelukkig rustig op een uurtje karaoke van de plaatselijke jeugd na
7562441 rafa has played great you know so he deserves the no 1 position i mean hes in a way the favorite now all of a sudden even on hardcourt because hes played so so well
7562442 we wanted it to be inspirational but we didnt want it to be we wanted to give it a little bit of funk you know so we put in the frickin because it made people realize that it was very minimal actually and that if you pull together you can actually get a lot of stuff done
7562443 we figured out that for somebody who makes 30 000 a year you make about 82 a day
7562444 its the first of a series of solar projects taking place throughout africa
7562445 i was raised kind of at a conservation center down in florida
7562446 with endangered species and animals and a lot of zoologists and so a lot of my youth memories are at this place and kind of playing with baby gazelles and baby cheetahs
7562447 i met him at a party in london at a big event about a year and a half ago
7562448 and he was moving to new york and i was like oh well give me a buzz and he didnt which was a total bummer and then i actually took the wrong subway one day which i never do and the doors opened and james was standing right in the door i think we went out for drinks later that week and weve been together almost a year
7562449 i applied thinking i would never get in but i got in so i was like dammit now i have to go
7562450 maybe one day when this whole modeling fantasy world ends ill go work for the u s government and work on like agricultural reform and making farms more sustainable
7562451 i just read this amazing book by barbara kingsolver called animal vegetable miracle
7562452 and it kind of opened my eyes to how horrible ive been with my food habits
7562453 you havent seen these you can look them up online theyre for the sundance channel its not like shes in
7562454 when i was in iraq i might as well have been circling the earth from a space capsule circling in farthest orbit like laika in sputnik a dog in space sending signals back to base unmoored and weightless and no longer marking time
7562455 on a foundation of small medium sized and extra large falsehoods
7562456 the obama nation erects a superstructure of innuendo guilt by often nonexistent association baseless speculation and sinister sounding but irrelevant digression
7562457 sole raison d tre is the promulgation of hard right politics
7562458 because obamas popularity is declining right now and they might have something to do with it
7562459 the day hillary conceded no no i mean suspended a deer crossed in front of my path on a four lane highway in rural new hampshire and i was thrown from the harley davidson
7562460 we will vote for mccain and it is going to break my heart
7562461 i won the james f hornback ethical humanist of the year in 2007
7562462 i think its more about the ride than the outcome theyre having a good time
7562463 el reglamento dice que la primera votaci n debe ser por consenso pero en la segunda votaci n se puede decidir en la forma que se decidi freddy ehlers ha cumplido fielmente con la normativa andina
7562464 por tanto no hay motivo alguno para que ehlers pueda ser separado y as lo han manifestado los gobiernos de per ecuador y colombia
7562465 no se ha desatendido la resoluci n 486 sino que se ha fortalecido el asunto est en que debemos tener una actitud positiva hacia la integraci n y no debemos ideologizar la pol tica exterior all est el error
7562466 and just to make sure youre imagining harrison ford ripping the hair off of his nuts
7562467 coldplays chris martin for instance planted 10 000 mango trees in india to offset whatever emissions were made during the release of a rush of blood to the head from their coal fired guitars or whatever
7562468 none of the ossetians is even thinking of reconciliation with georgia now
7562469 in 1991 our children turned into refugees now they have grown up to defend their homeland
7562470 i thought baby fat was one of the chinese volleyball players
7562471 courtesy of wbap news talk out of texas a tribute a musical tribute to the chinese olympic team
7562472 t hey said that you were too young i thought that was your name
7562473 how do you hide your baby fat you can fake a passport or do the twist but you dont seem to know how to drive
7562474 i thought baby fat was one of the chinese volleyball players
7562475 are those girls 16 jeez they look little tiny little tiny girls
7562476 if a woman chooses abortion shes entitled to a dead body no matter what
7562477 i thought baby fat was one of the chinese volleyball players
7562478 ela falou que ia tomar rem dio para dormir porque n o queria ver o v o
7562479 the right of abortion was not secured by the constitution
7562480 well i was 29 years old when i came to the us senate and i have learned a lot
7562481 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7562482 the inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a
7562483 i have been an author for twenty years and an ass for fifty five
7562484 im just really looking forward to going home to come off such a massive high you really want to just get home and relax
7562485 its been a pretty long 24 hours drowning our sorrows and i cant wait to get on that plane and head home
7562486 its really nice to get home but there really are some mixed emotions
7562487 there were a lot of emotional moments for the team members with all of the volunteers in our section of the village farewelling them
7562488 youve got to have a good break and see where the passion is
7562489 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country
7562490 i cant think of another instance where the country so universally gets behind an event and shares it like they have with beijing not with the widespread fragmentation we see today
7562491 nbc did some extremely smart things with live events but they also had a little luck
7562492 nbc did everything they could to give themselves the best shot at capitalizing on the premiere events and they clearly benefited from that all the way around
7562493 when you can look at single source data when you can measure a single persons use of all three platforms thats when you can start talking about currency
7562494 the olympics have been a part of the fabric of nbc since 1988
7562495 we will be at the table and well do a prudent deal if there is one to be had
7562496 it really falls in line with online video across the board
7562497 i dont think its a tipping point clearly users have voted with their tvs
7562498 from a business bottom line standpoint yes they were successful
7562499 did they miss learning things about 2010 and 2012 maybe
7562500 i dont think one can question whether it was programmed correctly
7562501 we knew it was going to be an uphill battle
7562502 i dont approach this as though we are entering into some competition
7562503 we call it a video wallscape video vinyl or led mesh
7562504 its infinitely scalable we can take any vertical or horizontal surface and turn it into a video billboard
7562505 we wanted to do this demonstration to show what you can do with these screens beyond just advertising
7562506 every pixel is intelligent but hopefully our screen wont become self aware
7562507 some people weve talked to are looking at signs 100 by 300 feet
7562508 we call it a video wallscape video vinyl or led mesh
7562509 its infinitely scalable we can take any vertical or horizontal surface and turn it into a video billboard

7562526 a lei do jeito que est mentirosa n o fact vel
7562527 n o temos sequer pessoas qualificadas para acompanhar esse processo menos ainda para dar as aulas
7562528 seria muito mais coerente criarmos um est gio intermedi rio onde a obriga o seria de cada cidade ter um conservat rio aberto aos alunos com profissionais bem preparados
7562529 sou totalmente favor vel ao ensino de m sica sempre achei uma pena ele ter sa do das escolas mas uma coisa que precisa ser muito bem pensada para que funcione
7562530 n o existe material dispon vel para o professor e isso precisar ser criado porque sem forma o e sem material did tico n o h possibilidade de dar certo
7562531 i will be coach while the club wants me and while i want to be here as soon as one of us doesnt think im the right man for the job it is time to move on
7562532 if the club wanted me to leave this year id leave
7562533 the win loss ratio is the only thing a coach can be judged on
7562534 people can have judgment calls and they might be right but most people think the coach has more control on a game of football than he actually does and i say that whether we have won or lost i think the coaching contribution is over rated
7562535 one of the things you do take note of attitude is a very hard thing to evaluate but the thing we have seen is group training has been energetic lively and enthusiastic
7562536 it was a where are we session we asked where are we now and what are we about in the next phase
7562537 its no different to five years ago it the age gap is two generations whichever way you look at it
7562538 i feel we are probably one of the teams that could have finished anywhere up to fourth and we are going to finish 10th or 11th so that is a failure
7562539 but i also think we have got more upside in our players than weve got logical downside so i still think we are on the up
7562540 marcus has written a book hasnt he well good luck like i say thats in the past right now were looking forward to playing the deshis up in darwin
7562541 well get our chance in the next 15 months to play against the poms back in england
7562542 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldnt recommend anything like that
7562543 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game
7562544 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going
7562545 its a tournament title australia currently holds and next year whenever they put it on well look forward to retaining that trophy
7562546 right now all the guys are rapt the icc has made a decision
7562547 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7562548 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7562549 icards http www icardentertainment com are a classy and inexpensive way for up and coming entertainers to quickly and easily reach the world with their music
7562550 theyre a great profit center for entertainers they can sell their music and participate in a revenue share because the bottom of each icard allows for sponsorship ads
7562551 most sites have just too much information for someone to read and navigate from a mobile device people do not want to read a book from their cell they just want to easily access specific information and get connected
7562552 why is it free we believe customers will love our product and will consider upgrading http www icardme com hitech and listing their company in our business directory our goal is to be the best mobile search company in the world one customer at a time
7562553 but i knew i only had one shot at this
7562554 we figured that if we can keep consumers captivated for a few minutes we can do something more than just run ads on a tv screen
7562555 i like the idea that this provides a service to the consumer rather than just bombarding them with ads

7562572 papers going up the cost of fuels going up postage is going up
7562573 theres not a lick of cost thats eroding from our company
7562574 now theyre demanding better rates without a sense of how much business theyre going to get
7562575 in years past it was flat cpms for flat business
7562576 now its i want to keep the same page rate but i dont need the same 50 pages
7562577 ive never seen anything like that in my 20 years of doing business
7562578 it says to me theres a great deal of speculation among advertisers about the fragile state of mind of magazine people and they need money
7562579 if publishers want share theyre going to have to bend on rates
7562580 papers going up the cost of fuels going up postage is going up

7562588 homeowners must weigh the up front costs of converting which range from 5 000 to upward of 10 000 against how many years it would take to recoup the money through lower heating bills
7562589 5 000 10 000 is pretty inexact i wouldve preferred three or four real life examples and maybe one using a condo building

7562593 im not even sure if it was in the box
7562594 if we eliminate the mistakes tonight then probably no different
7562595 ross assured me there was absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever ross is aware of his obligations
7562596 if its going to help put paid to rumours i will get him ocallaghan to look at the horse after he works
7562597 we took a total of 1000 on him on saturday
7562598 they are still taking him in doubles but no one wants to back him straight out
7562599 last season 33 trainers were notified and this season three trainers have been issued warnings
7562600 up to now there has been no change to that policy we will revisit these policies
7562601 we call it a video wallscape video vinyl or led mesh
7562602 its infinitely scalable we can take any vertical or horizontal surface and turn it into a video billboard

7562617 they see what their older siblings have and they want that same functionality the texting and the video
7562618 thats why nickelodeon is such a good fit for us kids are early adopters and icarly really connects with them on that level
7562619 they see what their older siblings have and they want that same functionality the texting and the video
7562620 thats why nickelodeon is such a good fit for us kids are early adopters and icarly really connects with them on that level

7562624 thats why nickelodeon is such a good fit for us kids are early adopters and icarly really connects with them on that level
7562625 its an area in which weve put a lot of investment and time its going to make more and more sense as digital evolves to connect from signage into point of sale or into coupons
7562626 we think a lot of newspaper dollars can come to us because were right at point of purchase
7562627 were starting to get past the point where the internet was circa 1995 where we had a new set of technologies introduced to the marketplace
7562628 we have technology now that engages a consumer in a way that allows that last impression that last line of offense to be as persuasive if not even more so than other kinds of media
7562629 i think advertisers are going to get smart about what they want to do in the environment creating perhaps specific advertising that works best in a particular venue whether its malls health clubs or movie theaters
7562630 with digital you flip the switch get it all up its distributed across the country also you can do more creatively and have a little more fun
7562631 theyre making those decisions a lot more last minute so for them just to quickly e mail and upload a creative and turnkey it in a couple days has been a positive thing
7562632 its creating for it making it work well and understanding how the audience reacts to it
7562633 those kinds of things are still open questions and once we figure them out i think the move to digital will start to happen more quickly i think this is the future i just dont know what the future is
7562634 theyre not there to watch television theyre there for some other reason and it doesnt involve entertainment
7562635 lends itself to a mall environment its easy to deploy and its not that expensive
7562636 our advertising is being used for applications in the mall environment that didnt exist a year or two ago

7562689 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7562690 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7562691 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7562692 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7562693 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7562694 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country

7562697 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis

7562701 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource

7562762 that while barack obamas had soaring rhetoric he has yet to put his stamp on the liberal tradition
7562763 obama needs to fulfill the glamorous and more difficult task of explaining specifically where he wants to move the country and how he proposes to move it above and beyond reciting his policy positions
7562764 largely abdicat ing their responsibility to provide unblinking and rigorous analysis instead of paeans to obamas image

7562821 safety is important i hope everybody has safety in their life
7562822 were feeling positive about these guys getting caught or at least we can make them have second thoughts about doing it again everybodys got to keep supporting each other and not letting these thugs get the upper hand its a major urban city you know crime happens we cant let it stop us from pursuing our livelihoods and make us live in fear thats no way to live im not willing to live that way
7562823 they were pretty uncertain about where to stand where to go what to do
7562824 they werent extremely confident in their actions the impression was that they had this idea maybe saw the news on tv and they thought about it a little bit but havent been at this very long
7562825 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7562826 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7562827 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7562828 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it

7562832 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
7562833 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available

7562838 no one wants an angry african american man in the
7562839 got to be able to hit and hes got to be able to run the bases
7562840 were going to come together we need to come together
7562841 im tried of war im tired of an economy thats on the shelf im tired of an that caters to oil companies
7562842 now with biden running for vice president it will defuse some of the racial issues some not completely
7562843 my sense is over the next four days well see a pretty stark contrast
7562844 we have been working closely with the city and county of denver
7562845 in the hours leading to the keynote address by the candidates wife michelle obama
7562846 well learn about obamas values from the people who know him best
7562847 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7562848 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7562849 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7562850 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house
7562851 if i were barack obama right now i would be hoping against hope that the celebrities would just keep quiet about me
7562852 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
7562853 the mccain people decided to take the things that are obamas assets hes charismatic hes likeable the press adore him all that stuff and turn that into a liability
7562854 obamas people should respond by saying this is a really good thing obama has gotten people to forget about
7562855 being popular should be a good thing if youre running for president
7562856 if could draw 250 000 people in berlin he would do it if he could fill up a football stadium at his convention he would do it
7562857 i think obama could very easily say whats wrong with being popular theres nothing wrong with being a talented
7562858 somehow they think that if you take the high road its going to appeal to people that people dont like negative ads
7562859 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7562860 to scare the heck out of you about the democratic nominee
7562861 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7562862 but ultimately this election is not about me its about you and whether we are going to allow ourselves to watch this country get run into the ground
7562863 whether we are going to do the same old things over and over and over again and somehow expect a different result or whether we are finally going to decide not this time this time were going to try something different
7562864 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7562865 it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the american people are going to face in november
7562866 i have respect for john mccains service i dont have respect for john mccains policies because they represent four more years of the same
7562867 the same attitude and the same out of touch policies
7562868 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair
7562869 so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well
7562870 no one wants an angry african american man in the white house

7562878 in contrast to chees acts of civil disobedience singaporeans and myanmar nationals in singapore have organised themselves to express their sentiments and concerns for the myanmar situation in a lawful manner
7562879 even the obp demonstrators yesterday previously said they did not wish to break the law
7562880 chosen to conduct their activities in open and persistent defiance of our laws
7562881 programs that fail to maintain safe environments will have contracts terminated
7562882 was an assessment to look at safety not a child placing assessment nor was it a child abuse investigation
7562883 well begin next week visiting with them going through assessment work with them to get them to quality we need or we will terminate contracts
7562884 since ephraim has multiplied altars for sin they have become altars of sinning for him though i wrote for him ten thousand precepts of my law they are regarded as a strange thing
7562885 i have not departed from the command of his lips i have treasured the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
7562886 though i wrote for him ten thousand precepts of my law they are regarded as a strange thing
7562887 your words were found and i ate them and your words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart for i have been called by your name o lord god of hosts
7562888 i will tell you that i did get a little preview of the video they did of her and she was extraordinary
7562889 still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people are going to face in november
7562890 people are trying to fit her somewhere in their minds and in this array of images we have in our culture about african american women as the vixen or the mammy or the angry black woman
7562891 but she doesnt fit any of the molds so she is kind of unsettling to a lot of people she is something new
7562892 for some people she is supposed to represent a woman who is more traditional in her approach to the office of first lady and be somebody to do the requisite entertaining and look after her husband
7562893 but some feel like the first lady should be more of an activist in the model of eleanor roosevelt or hillary clinton

7562896 weve fleshed out the details of what was announced in the budget and the details are the exciting part
7562897 it means hundreds of thousands of dollars in new support for students from low and middle income families
7562898 step into a career and ultimately a very successful life
7562899 hes very sick as people may remember he has brain cancer but if he actually makes it to the podium and can say a few words to this gathering the rafters are going to be blown off this place
7562900 when you look at those polls that say 30 per cent of clinton supporters are now going to vote for john mccain he desperately needs to keep them on his side of the ledger
7562901 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7562902 i think she will just be herself she is a personable wonderful woman and will be a terrific first lady
7562903 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7562904 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7562905 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7562906 look how f cking awesome we are dont you just want to buy our brand of america

7562911 paypal has been working through the process of identifying its customers that have recently been affected by the collapse of ebs international in liquidation operating on ebay com au as ebusiness supplies and running the website at www bestbargains com au
7562912 customers who have been directly impacted by ebusiness collapse have now all been credited by paypal to either their paypal account or credit card
7562913 early on we provide a very rough estimate in figures
7562914 the matter has now been finalised and as a business we will not be disclosing the numbers publicly
7562915 were dealing with a large number of people both on and off ebay and we had to have some confidence that payments were being made to the right people
7562916 hopefully therell be some manufacturers that will take that step
7562917 said bill marler a seattle attorney who represents food contamination victims
7562918 hopefully the public will be less concerned about it all the evidence suggests that theres not a risk
7562919 the government has a live commercial selection process under way for the national broadband network and it is therefore inappropriate to speculate on the potential outcome of the request for proposals
7562920 it has always been the governments position that the provision of appropriate network information to proponents is important for the success of the national broadband network process and that this should be done as soon as possible
7562921 if telstra win the bid it will switch it on straight away in april
7562922 that is of course if the government goes for a quick fix instead of an innovative and open access solution
7562923 in 2009 with or without the network telstra will still deliver 12mbps to all metro areas if the government decides to go with telstra there will be no competition and under serviced areas will suffer
7562924 telstra is not interested in pursuing the spirit of the network which is about open access and broadband for under serviced areas
7562925 it would be much better if the government stuck to its election promises and picked a network based on open access even though this may mean australia wont see services for some months it will be worth it
7562926 it all depends on who the successful bidder is how quickly they can mobilise whether they have contractors lined up and if they have already pre purchased fibre equipment
7562927 if the proponent hasnt selected a vendor we can expect more delays
7562928 weve been sitting on selecting a vendor until we get the network information and the clock starts ticking we are making a short list because we may need multiple types of technology from different vendors
7562929 these discussions in the shops were more like public debating societies or what we call these days labor forums
7562930 what they power stations were looking for was a solution where they could repair the blades in situ
7562931 the rotor is taken out of the turbine and put in a cradle we dont remove the blades but use laser technology to put a new coating on them
7562932 we are also looking at robotic technology for the profiling of the blades
7562933 currently there are a lot of infrared imaging systems out there for night vision and other surveillance and reconnaissance work but the image is just like black and white it only measures the intensity of infrared that falls on the detector
7562934 we have come up with technology whereby on that infrared imaging chip you can place essentially another filtering element which allows you to select the wavelengths you want to hit the detector
7562935 that wavelength information can tell you a lot about what it is you are looking at
7562936 for example every tank has an infrared imaging system for night vision you can look a few kilometres away and see another tank but it is a black and white image so you cant tell if it is a friendly tank or not
7562937 the idea with our technology is you can go into a mode where you actually detect the spectrum from the tank allowing you to identify what kind of tank it is because the spectrum has information about the paint that is used and the material it is made from and all sorts of stuff

7562961 i did a quick google search on the cheshire motor inn in atlanta and came up with the following customer comments
7562962 if cruising is your thing then this is the place for you there are 3 buildings but theyve never offered to put me up in the cottages and its just as well if you are looking for discretion and privacy then choose the back building
7562963 this place is the worst hotel or whatever it is the drawers were filled with roaches the closet was filled with urine smell which reek throughout disgusting and despicable no one should enter i would not let my dog lay on this floor
7562964 no the cheshire is not the ritz but it is not marketed as the ritz it is also not a place to take children furthermore this area of atlanta has nothing that is geared toward children to me this is a good thing
7562965 small roaches in the bathroom but i could have lived with that
7562966 i stayed there the weekend of february 20 2004 two friends both male were in the room adjacent that saturday morning a heavily tattooed man with multiple earrings and a nosering walked right into their open door first he asked to borrow a pen then he asked if they would like some southern hospitality his words when they politely declined he repeated the offer

7563018 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7563019 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7563020 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7563021 inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns

7563194 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

7563213 the awarding of these bursaries do not only benefit individual students his her family and community but is importantly part of the governments accelerated skill development programme and development of our youth so that they may escape many social ills confronting our society

7563216 this weeks democratic national convention in denver colorado and the republican convention in minneapolis st
7563217 weve been preparing for 15 months and we feel very confident
7563218 todays pre convention events here in denver included a heavy dose of what has since before 9 11 become a staple of coneventioneering cops paramilitaries and other displays of state power
7563219 i dont care what denver does to enforce order at the democratic national convention or for that matter what minneapolis st paul does at the republican convention but i wonder why more democratic leaders arent complaining about

7563228 its not surprising after these incidents that some people may be concerned we have taken our eye off the ball
7563229 qantas is the worldwide launch airline for the system and as with any new it system especially one of this scale there were some minor teething problems but these were limited in their nature and impact
7563230 were very pleased with the programs implementation and believe given the projects scale we have handled the transition extremely well

7563233 you have to avoid being tempted to move into an area that looks interesting or has money to spend but where youre not going to add value
7563234 in 10 years or maybe even five years from now we might want to add a fifth or sixth or eighth vertical but not in the short term
7563235 india has a fairly high rate of inflation at the moment especially in the technology space
7563236 these vendors will increasingly be considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors in this space
7563237 such a shift in the it service landscape is a key trend that application development and sourcing managers need to understand and prepare for
7563238 our analysis indicates that the top five india based it companies have raised combined market share from 33 per cent in the 2004 financial year to 40 per cent in the 2008 financial year
7563239 these companies took a 51 per cent share of incremental revenue in 2008
7563240 we believe this trend will continue in 2009 as vendor consolidation gathers momentum we expect the indian it industry to grow at 20 per cent in us terms in 2009 despite the us slowdown
7563241 its the kind of structure you would see in large private companies its the kind of structure you would see if perhaps there was more than one shareholder bearing in mind that at the moment simon hackett is the only shareholder we could expand the shareholdings and you cant do this when youre configured as a single director private company

7563260 this may also be connected with governments decision that polytechnics will award
7563261 i had to move them to the institute of development management idm
7563262 we have noticed some frivolous moves by the council to downgrade our institution in the name of non provision of required facilities by the university
7563263 we have provided laboratories teaching hospital qualified teachers including four professors and enough classrooms to accommodate our staff
7563264 though professional accreditation is important we will not succumb to any politics or lobbying
7563265 our concern is to train veterinary doctors for the benefit of the country
7563266 the students are not exposed to clinicals which is the major component of veterinary studies as they are now using temporary facilities
7563267 the universitys facilities does not conform with the required minimum standard
7563268 it is the future of the students that is important to the council
7563269 having denied the programme accreditation the institution should close the faculty and transfer the students to other relevant programmes or veterinary colleges approved by the council
7563270 by law the nuc works jointly with the national manpower board to determine the manpower needs of the state and we didnt need to consult vcn to grant approval to university of abuja to run the veterinary medicine programme
7563271 but if a professional body gives notice of a moratorium for instance if graduates from such a course dont have jobs or for other genuine reasons it could be considered
7563272 djibril will be one of the top scorers in the premier league i know it
7563273 it is great for him to be at sunderland and great for the premier league to have him
7563274 this is the worlds best league and he can show everyone now how good he is
7563275 this is the new sunderland and we know what we can achieve
7563276 i think our performances have shown why we can believe in having a great season
7563277 playing for arsenal would be the biggest achievement in my life
7563278 there are lots of young footballers but amongst the best european clubs only one work like they do i love it
7563279 our display this time will be much much better of that i am confident
7563280 our performance in liege was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7563281 it is a relief because usually in these situations it comes down to the players at the last minute to make the decision
7563282 however in this case the ecb and the icc have come up with the sensible decision a lot can happen between now and then but at the moment the concerns were the security there
7563283 but a lot can happen in a year and we can then take it from there
7563284 i have been trying to talk about the positives but some people are more concerned about the negative aspects if there are any
7563285 the means to get more players in is there that has been established we have a number of situations that could be resolved in the next few days
7563286 we want to bring in good players to complement those already here that is what we are trying to do in the remaining part of the window
7563287 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7563288 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7563289 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7563290 i am happy to be part of the committee especially being an east end boy as i am
7563291 i am looking forward to the regeneration of excitement back into sport in east london i know how passionate the area is for football
7563292 2012 is not about the opening ceremony or whether london can better beijings i dont think that it should be about whether we can better the opening ceremony
7563293 we will see what is going to happen but having another winger would permit us to play with three guys up front which would be good for the balance of the team
7563294 i was speaking with some of my classmates who were becoming doctors and lawyers and other people who could have an impact on the world and i started to wonder how i might be able to do that fixing typos was what i came up with ive always been aware of typos wherever i go and i figured that it was a national problem

7563339 nachdem der wochenstart sehr ruhig verlaufen ist richtet sich die aufmerksamkeit des marktes nun auf den am morgigen dienstag anstehenden ifo index
7563340 aktien und rentenmarkt spekulieren zunehmend auf eine zinssenkung durch die ezb im ersten quartal n chsten jahres angesichts der j ngsten preisdaten aus der eurozone scheint uns diese spekulation etwas zu fr h einzusetzen
7563341 wir w rden eine bernahme der dresdner bank durch die commerzbank positiv beurteilen
7563342 wirklich neu ist das nicht die spekulationen sind schon seit wochen wieder hochgekocht

7563347 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7563348 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7563349 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7563350 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
7563351 whether theyre market based or not we shouldnt understate the role that they play in having a counter cyclical effect on the credit markets
7563352 im increasingly skeptical of the viability of a privatized fannie and freddie
7563353 im not hearing anything about exactly how it would work in this kind of environment
7563354 if the federal government is going to put money into it then they should certainly share in the profits as well as the losses
7563355 it would be a lot better politically not happening in the final months of the second term of a president but this is what weve got
7563356 fannie and freddie have taken a reasonable mission and basically worked the system in a way so that the profits go to the private sector and the losses or the risk goes to the public sector
7563357 the ability of the new regulator to approve new products for fannie and freddie is potentially powerful
7563358 theres an opportunity here to refocus on that public purpose
7563359 what we have seen in the securitization process is a moral hazard that emerges from the standpoint of passing on credit risk
7563360 i think theres a growing sense that credit risk should remain with the lender and shouldnt be passed off through complex securitization processes
7563361 the issue is not the privatization of fannie and freddie because that implies the perpetuation of that type of institution
7563362 we should transition to a new model for housing finance in this country i think covered bonds represent the funding side of that model
7563363 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going
7563364 i think all the guys are happy now we know now that the icc cricket australia and aca australian cricketers association would make a decision and theyve finally done that
7563365 its a tournament title australian currently holds and next year whenever they put it on well look forward to retaining that trophy
7563366 right now all the guys are rapt the icc has made a decision
7563367 well good luck like i say thats in the past
7563368 at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough but you cannot really do anything about it your concentration level has to be up all the time it is very draining but that is what international cricket is all about

7563371 you remember about 6 weeks a go the usual suspect wizards were projecting a disaster with the u s corn crop corn futures reached 7 50 per bushel and the wizards were talking ten dollars about 4 weeks ago we took a 3000 mile midwest road trip and reported to you we saw an excellent crop the usda came out with a revised corn production estimate lo and behold the corn crop estimate is up 570 million bushels from julys estimate is it any wonder corn is two dollar a bushel less then a few weeks ago a two dollar a bushel decrease has lowered the cost of production 20 00 plus per head
7563372 i never expected this to happen the prices for cull cows and bulls have shot up significantly at the grunthal auction mart over the last three months
7563373 ive not seen prices like this since before the bse crisis hit in may of 2003 well it is about time
7563374 if producers age verify their animals and are young enough to go to the usa they will bring higher dollars for the producers
7563375 it is positive news the price of corn and the canadian dollar is declining this should mean more money to cattle producers selling calves this fall
7563376 its disappointing to have to postpone the tournament but in the end it was a rigorous process that was followed and in the end the security advice around pakistan has just been too tough to overcome
7563377 we wanted to see the process run its course and in the end we didnt have to make a call
7563378 the weight of opinion from around the world meant that it was an obvious choice
7563379 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment the right decision has been made and everyones pretty comfortable with it
7563380 the decision was due to a circumstance in that country that was out of the control of the local cricket board

7563389 we are caught in the moment in the changes in the communications industry and the general downturn of the economy at the same time
7563390 a slowing economy means people are choosing wireless phones over landlines resulting in increased access line losses
7563391 that in turn is reducing the number of people the phone companies can convince to switch to their higher speed networks and video services cables triple play bundles which include higher speeds and voice are starting to resonate with the residential customers leading to further landline losses phone companies own higher speed services are starting to cannibalize their installed base instead of luring customers away from cable companies

7563407 ministers are often able to handle difficult questions simply by reading information from a prepared brief rather than being tested on the detail of a particular issue
7563408 there is no opportunity in the house of representatives for any supplementary questions to be asked in order to elicit further information in the senate only one supplementary is allowed
7563409 the house has noticed the prime ministers remarkable transformation in the past few weeks from stalin to mr bean

7563411 catalog management and supplier enablement continue to be major inhibitors for success with e procurement when implementations involve more than twenty suppliers
7563412 innovative software based approaches that apply consumer market internet technologies to b2b collaboration should be considered as valid alternatives to leveraging supplier portals and business process hubs
7563413 vinimayas revenues for the first half of 2008 have already exceeded total annual revenues for the previous year
7563414 our ability to consumerize the e procurement experience is the key to our customer growth more and more buyers and suppliers are realizing the benefits of this approach to supplier enablement and catalog management and working with channel partners and oems is helping us engage the marketplace across multiple industry verticals erp and e procurement platforms
7563415 its exciting to see that the official chinese olympics site was built in a variety of languages so as to attract visitors from across the globe
7563416 once again the internet like the olympic games itself shows that we are truly becoming a world without borders
7563417 the selection was a terrible misstep and demonstrates how seeking to balance a ticket actually only serves to emphasize the negatives of both the candidate and his running mate lets take a look at some of the reasoning going on in the obama camp and why little of it holds water

7563424 i think its really close to miraculous when you think about what the structure was to begin with and the amount of work thats happened over the last eight months to really transform it for use
7563425 this is clearly a slip form utilitarian structure using mid 20th century technology
7563426 the design intent was to respect that simple character and the exterior accommodations to allow light to get into the structure have been done in the simplest manner to keep it as close as they could to its original appearance
7563427 it was built in 1939 and theres no deterioration to the concrete whatsoever a lot of interior had to be removed
7563428 was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7563429 taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
7563430 is insufficient to allow them to engage in such discrimination
7563431 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
7563432 will deny physicians and other professionals the ability to freely exercise their religious convictions
7563433 by forcing healthcare professional to choose between conscience and career we will lose doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals who are already in short supply
7563434 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience
7563435 freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
7563436 the bush administration and the department of health and human services are to be applauded for taking important steps to protect the freedom of conscience of physicians and other health care providers in the united states who find the wholesale termination of the lives of our preborn citizens to be unconscionable and reprehensible
7563437 as a society we should be encouraging conscience in our nations health care providers not seeking to coerce consciences against their wills
7563438 desperately needed to protect first amendment rights and implement federal law in what is becoming a jungle of coercion in health care
7563439 as one of the leading womens health care providers and advocates planned parenthood will not stand by and watch the bush administration deny quality affordable health care and accurate information to women
7563440 prohibit discrimination on the basis of ones objection to participation in or refusal to participate in specific medical procedures including abortion or sterilization
7563441 sometimes the discrimination and coercion because of life affirming views is subtle such as denying admission to medical students training privileges to residents or promotions to graduate physicians
7563442 other times a line is clearly and overtly drawn between either participating in unethical actions or losing their position or career
7563443 refrain from organizing and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from

7563445 i think it displays the blatant hypocrisy of the chinese government who is telling the world on one hand that theyre tolerating religious freedom while at the same time they are severely persecuting house church christians
7563446 all the house church wants to do is worship in freedom without fear of being persecuted
7563447 n o state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

7563453 if you look at the history of wilson high school it was established as a freedmans bureau school
7563454 this school has survived world wars and segregation and throughout it all it has kept its identity from my perspective how could all that happen if god didnt have his hands on it theres no way we still pray before games its strictly an option with every player
7563455 the world has gone too long without a cardinal ratzinger
7563456 after all wasnt it mostly out of affection that john paul ii had the then msgr dziwisz ordained an archbishop
7563457 the goal is to bring down the walls of the convention and invite in an audience thats as large as possible
7563458 credentialing more bloggers opens up all sorts of new audiences
7563459 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7563460 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7563461 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come
7563462 my authority as archbishop in the archdiocese of brisbane is scarcely recognised by the parish of st marys this is not unusual considering that criticism at st marys has been directed against pope john paul ii

7563468 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7563469 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand

7563475 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7563476 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7563477 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7563478 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7563479 i like turning my back to the audience when i play but its a lot harder when there are people behind me

7563490 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back

7563497 we are going to create a social problem to solve another social problem and at the expense of those who are least able to articulate their predicament
7563498 the social engineers will come in and tinker with it to save a few quid which they are always willing to do at the bottom end of the scale they are not that keen on doing it at the top end
7563499 of course the best answer to making sure that you keep your welfare payments is to make sure your children go to school

7563514 there are more people going to venues and more events held at the mcg
7563515 if it is due to anything it would be due to the increased patronage
7563516 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7563517 even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie

7563520 we have the best surgeons you can get and they just cant do what they are supposed to be doing
7563521 urgent and emergency cases are having to take precedence on our elective
7563522 we are trying to milk every ounce out of this system at the moment to ensure there is no one left behind and there is no child at risk
7563523 it is not about waiting for the new hospital it is past critical point now
7563524 we need at least 10 more icu beds immediately with trained nurses
7563525 following discussions with the royal childrens hospital and monash medical centre we have been asked to convey to ceos the significant pressure that picu services are experiencing
7563526 as such your health service may be asked to care for a patient under 16 years of age in your adult intensive care unit
7563527 with an international shortage of pediatric icu nurses there are sometimes limits on the number of icu beds that can be safely opened
7563528 however the brumby government has significantly increased the states neonatal and pediatric icu capacity from 52 beds in 2000 to 72 beds in 2008
7563529 we are building a brand new 1 billion state of the art childrens hospital with the capacity to treat an extra 35 000 patients every year
7563530 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7563531 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7563532 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7563533 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7563534 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7563535 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial
7563536 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7563537 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7563538 i tried to hang onto a life i had known and grown accustomed to
7563539 i finally just decided that it came down to that i wanted to live it was that basic
7563540 most of us are taught it in elementary school three meals a day a little bit of snacking here and there
7563541 i make sure to walk every single day exercise is the key factor in weight loss i did it every day no excuses
7563542 before it was always a vanity issue i want to look this way i want to wear this size clothes
7563543 it had to finally come down to this is my health i dont feel well and something has to change you just have to find the power within yourself because when you say i cant do that youve already defeated yourself
7563544 sat down and examined what i was doing it was at that point i gave up night eating i was a night eater you save all your fruits at 7 30 8 30 9 30 that you should have eaten during the day so i cut myself off i stopped eating at night and i never do that anymore
7563545 when you feel these negative thoughts coming you have to catch them in the midst and say i can do this and maybe not even think about how far you have to go just take it one step at a time
7563546 i finally realized i had to change my life and my style of living
7563547 we were out with each other last night and never once in the course of four hours did we ever talk about food or what we eat
7563548 it was all about your heads and our life people are missing that picture and they just get too possessed by numbers and scales and following this and following that for us it was making a change

7563557 omdat onze verzoeken aan de georgische en de russische autoriteiten tot dusver onvoldoende informatie hebben opgeleverd zullen we zelf een team afvaardigen dat op korte termijn ter plaatse feitenonderzoek kan uitvoeren
7563558 its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7563559 he spun me out so i just you know got into him a little bit and let him know that i didnt appreciate the way he passed me and he retaliated and ended up spinning me out
7563560 he is a complete player he comes to play every shift he works hard he has good skill he skates well he shows good strength for his age his work ethic is good there are other players who maybe do some of those things well but he is a complete player thats the best way to describe him
7563561 he is definitely a very talented player and he has to rank among the top players that ive seen over the last 20 years
7563562 if i play in washington ill give this team my heart i just want to play in the nhl jeff schultz d calgary hitmen whl
7563563 when youre 17 years old and youre 6 foot 6 youre still growing into your body youre probably a little more awkward at that age compared to someone who is 5 foot 11 and weighs 200 pounds and is already matured physically we expect jeff to put on another 30 pounds over the next three or four years right now what jeff needs to do is work on his core strength and work on his leg strength i think working on his leg strength will also improve his skating a little bit
7563564 last year as a 16 year old i didnt get much playing time i came into this year wanting to be on the power play and the penalty kill and wanting to be one of those go to guys for tough times i came into each practice and worked real hard and the coaches had a lot of confidence in me and they put me into those situations that i wasnt in last year
7563565 i think wade redden he is real poised with the puck makes the smart play with the puck all the time he likes the offensive and defensive sides of the game and i try to play like him
7563566 the one hockey player i probably like the most would be scott niedermayer i think hes a great player and i try to idolize him as much as possible
7563567 chris bourque skates very well hes got great hands and he is very competitive some people might say hes on the smaller side but were talking about strength here and chris is very strong on his skates
7563568 not too many people are going to live up to the name bourque if i have just half the career he had thatll still be a great career im not looking to be my dad im my own person im chris bourque im going to do my best
7563569 i dont look at a guy as big just someone i have to get past if you come watch me play you will see that
7563570 he is a player who plays with a good edge he is not big in stature in terms of height but he is solidly built he has good hands he sees the ice really well he makes good plays and he has a knack for scoring goals he goes after it pretty good
7563571 i do consider myself a playmaking center but i also consider myself a defensive center i dont get to watch the nhl that much but during an interview in toronto the phoenix coyotes said that i resembled ron francis in my style
7563572 junkov is a real solid two way guy he was the kind of player that you might be watching his wingers because they had been given a little more of a buildup before the season started but as you kept watching he kept catching your eye because he was very good on faceoffs he played really well defensively and he made some real nice plays with the puck he turned out to be a good fit with those high scoring wingers he does a lot of the work that makes people successful in the nhl its nice to have a player like that where you dont have to spend as much time teaching him that side of the game
7563573 sami is a bit of a late bloomer he had a very good year this year he played in the elite league in finland which is an excellent league and he also performed very well in the world juniors this year were very pleased that we had a chance to draft him
7563574 barack obama i mean you got sorta the first articulate and bright and clean african american who is good looking i mean thats a storybook man
7563575 cant even go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts in my state without a slight indian accent im not joking
7563576 the cia already conducts operations in partnership with the pakistanis
7563577 nato would like to have the same relationship with pakistan
7563578 they are the first thing we ask for when we plan an operation
7563579 the big thing is that they help us at the lowest tactical level they find information that which allows us to make decisions
7563580 we were all worried about oh my god my sisters never going to get married because each guy shes meet shes gonna chew him up spit him out he has said so i was thinking barack says one wrong thing and shes going to jettison him
7563581 she said hey take him to play a game of basketball and tell me what you think
7563582 extremely confident but not cocky with a good sense of team
7563583 brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents
7563584 werbefuzzis trinken einen latte macchiato nach dem anderen und warten auf eine tolle idee
7563585 nicox and pfizer are in active discussions regarding the worldwide rights to pf 03187207 which we believe has a certain commercial potential which should be realized said michele garufi chairman and ceo of nicox
7563586 we are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year
7563587 im disappointed that it happened id like to continue to move forward in the campaign and make sure that we get back on track talking about the issues
7563588 but i think were focusing on the issues and have been all along in this campaign but we just simply couldnt allow the signs to continually be stolen
7563589 i was so tired today that i passed out for a nap at 4 oclock
7563590 the good news is almost all the key milestones that we talked about the company did a great job of meeting
7563591 this is one of those unusual cases where everything went right drug development is high risk youre dealing with a lot of unknowns but to date all of the clinical trials have been very successful
7563592 the rest of the world has its eyes on talent like british cycling performance director dave brailsford
7563593 other countries are trying to steal our coaches and its not going to be surprising if the phone rings
7563594 i will be able to dance i will make it
7563595 if you saw my room it looked like a murder scene i did hurt myself but im fine i wish this didnt happen i have to wear heels all day
7563596 its a book its a non volatile storage medium its very rare you should have one
7563597 dude we should like you know go to denver and protest the way the mans keeping us down
7563598 dont bogart the bong dude thats be totally righteous we could get some cool banners and some buckets to bang on
7563599 we dont want to be instrumental in overthrowing any government we dont have any such intentions
7563600 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7563601 i think at the moment they definitely have the upper hand and we need to do something better
7563602 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7563603 we have briefed the family of the missing person inspector lefevre said
7563604 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7563605 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7563606 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7563607 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7563608 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7563609 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7563610 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support
7563611 al eliminar las contratistas todos salimos perjudicados hasta los chavistas vamos a quedar por fuera
7563612 hay que eliminar las contratistas eso es capitalismo salvaje vienen unos se ores crean una empresa van y contratan a los trabajadores les pagan una miseria ni siquiera salario m nimo no tienen seguridad social los explotan como si fueran esclavos y ellos se llevan la gran tajada
7563613 im not gonna teach your boyfriend how to dance with you
7563614 proponemos informar a los socios sobre la necesidad de salir de algunos acuerdos que actualmente contradicen los intereses de rusia
7563615 al mismo tiempo nuestra econom a y algunos de sus sectores entre ellos la agricultura tienen una carga bastante pesada
7563616 esto hace que no veamos y no sintamos ninguna ventaja en pertenecer a la omc suponiendo que la haya y nos implica una carga
7563617 esto no significa que debamos renunciar a nuestra aspiraci n estrat gica en la omc pero hay que aclarar la cuesti n
7563618 everyone was needed by everyone else in one capacity or another
7563619 people who customarily refer to themselves as taxpayers are not even remotely related to democratic citizens
7563620 what taxpayers do not do and what people who call themselves taxpayers long since stopped even imaging themselves doing is governing
7563621 this time we do have things to say in the european market we have the music service and were doing great things on singstar and theres more to come these are global announcements
7563622 they recognize that the games convention in europe whether its in leipzig cologne or london we can do the announcements wherever
7563623 emerged as the kind of track that pop and underground music fans of all stripes could rally behind
7563624 i dont get it every time mom says that she cant take anymore and is worn out and is exhausted i get sent to my room for a nap
7563625 just what we needed i sit in it every afternoon and ready and the kids cant get to me
7563626 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
7563627 we are very pleased with the level of professionalism demonstrated by standard amp poors as well as blueskymls in assisting us with our us exemption process
7563628 though our conventional oil potential is of great interest it gives me significant satisfaction to see fractured oil shale project command the attention of one of the worlds largest financial publication and news portals north american unconventional fractured shale projects have received great attention within the energy industry resulting in significant value increases to shareholders trans orient is excited to be one of the first movers in unconventional exploration internationally
7563629 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7563630 the development of this site will enable us to continue expansion of our silicon business in the most cost efficient manner and will consequently support recs further growth downstream as well as our ambitious long term cost target

7563632 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
7563633 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
7563634 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
7563635 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
7563636 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
7563637 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
7563638 while southern baptist pastors are united in their view of the inerrancy of scripture they must be aware that 1 out of 4 people who attend their churches each month consider the bible less than totally accurate or authoritative
7563639 das ist eine sendung der die themen nie ausgehen und die immer wieder eine gro e herausforderung bedeutet

7563658 the hardness was in their hearts and not in the saying
7563659 at this also my heart trembles and leaps from its place
7563660 that at these things my heart trembles and skips a beat
7563661 by taking a long and thoughtful look at what god has created people have always been able to see what their eyes as such cant see eternal power for instance and the mystery of his divine being so nobody has a good excuse
7563662 what good thing must i do to get eternal life
7563663 i tell you the truth unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you 54 whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day 55 for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink john 6 53 55 niv
7563664 what if you see the son of man ascend to where he was before
7563665 dont grumble at my teaching about eating my flesh and drinking my blood im not speaking literally for you will not even be able to see my body anymore much less feed on it
7563666 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen v 2 for by it the elders obtained a good report v 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear v 4 by faith abel offered god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh v 5 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god v 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god nust believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him v 7 by faith n oah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
7563667 two and two makes four that is mathematics hydrogen and oxygen form water that is chemistry christ crucified is the power of god unto salvation that is revelation but how do you know put two and two together and you have four count and see put hydrogen and oxygen together and you have water test and you will prove it believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved believe and you will know each demonstration is unanswerable in its own sphere
7563668 a real christian is an odd number anyway he feels supreme love for one whom he or she has never seen talks familiarly every day to someone he or she cannot see expects to go to heaven on the virtue of another empties himself or herself in order to be full admits he or she is wrong so he or she can be declared right goes down in order to get up is strongest when he or she is weakest richest when he or she isw poorest and happiest when he or she feels worst he or she dies so he or she can live forsakes in order to have gives away so he or she can keep sees the invisible hears the inaudible and knows that which passeth knowledge
7563669 you mean that i dont have to go home with you
7563670 you mean that i dont have to do what you tell me to do or say what you tell me to say
7563671 you mean i dont have to be your slave i dont have to put up with your whims and your fancies
7563672 no you dont i paid the price for you and so i can now set you free
7563673 for john the baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine and you say he has a demon
7563674 the son of man has come eating and drinking and you say behold a gluttonous man and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners
7563675 the son of man came eating and drinking a friend of sinners

7563763 superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
7563764 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
7563765 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
7563766 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
7563767 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled both ships are flying greek flags and are in international waters we are the victims of electronic piracy we are currently in gms p area a2 and we are relying on our satellite communications equipment to make a distress call if needed we are civilians from 17 nations and are on this project to break the siege of gaza we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board such an emergency develop we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
7563768 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
7563769 your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up
7563770 defense officials favor forcefully blocking two boats which a group of u
7563771 israel may use force to halt boat trying to break gaza siege
7563772 weve been waiting a long time to unify our group which has been split between cyprus and crete we are excited to combine both groups who have worked so hard on this project and are so enthusiastic about setting out for gaza on the way in today we had the cypriot authorities escorting us now its time for the world to escort us to gaza
7563773 it was exhilarating to watch the boats come in after waiting so patiently over the past two weeks
7563774 said a delighted fathi jaouadi one of the passengers on board
7563775 on the 14th of august 2008 an anonymous man called my home in france as my daughters played hide and seek in the garden this stranger spoke to my husband warning him that your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up my husband asked how it was this person had obtained our private home number no response was forthcoming but the illicit threats carried on
7563776 the illegal exploitation of family members who in most instances are not suspects themselves has on many occasions caused severe psychological suffering to interrogees and to their innocent relatives in more extreme cases this method takes the form of psychological torture of a detainee rendering him a victim of a cruel psychological manipulation via the illegal exploitation of a close relative
7563777 defense officials favor forcefully blocking two boats which a group of u s based activists plan to sail to gaza a position paper by the foreign ministrys legal department says israel has the right to use force against the demonstrators as part of the oslo accords the foreign ministrys paper means that security forces could detain the vessels upon entry to gazas territorial waters arrest the passengers and haul the ship to israel where the detainees could be interrogated
7563778 hey man its an emergency i made a huge mistake
7563779 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7563780 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7563781 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7563782 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7563783 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7563784 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7563785 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7563786 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7563787 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7563788 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7563789 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7563790 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7563791 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7563792 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7563793 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7563794 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7563795 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7563796 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7563797 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7563798 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7563799 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7563800 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7563801 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7563802 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7563803 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7563804 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7563805 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that

7563811 maybe its because weve been told our whole lives the things we cant do rather than what we can do
7563812 there were negotiations going on between israelis and palestinians back in 2000 then prime minister barak ehud barak offered to the palestinians who of course were demanding appropriately that their capital of their palestinian state should be in the palestinian city of east jerusalem and instead barak said of course we cant allow that to happen but well let you have your capital in abu dis well even let you call it al quds which is arabic for jerusalem
7563813 while i have to admit throwing out a number like 100 000 seemed pretty overzealous after seeing how hard digital titles are to sell i still hoped we could reach that lofty goal boy did i miss the mark 7 days over 130 000 units holy fiddlesticks that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut consumers voted with their dollars they basically have sent the message loud and clear we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy

7563824 ive been a fan of rubbing sticks together since i learned how to do it several million years ago and i dont see why anyone would do anything differently i cant imagine how anyone could come up with a more flexible or powerful method of starting fires
7563825 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7563826 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7563827 for the first time china has won more gold medals than them
7563828 nuking massive cities to cut off their supply of men being the only strategy that could actually defeat that country
7563829 its true amazing how communist countries think its total brainwash

7563831 the anticipation of the olympic games intensified world scrutiny of korea during a time of political crisis as political demonstrations emerged in june 1987 the possibility of jeopardizing hosting the olympic games contributed to the june 29 declaration which issued president chun out of power and led to direct elections in december 1987 citation needed the desire not to taint the olympic games with military dictatorship and riots served as an impetus for koreas transition to democracy

7563837 under a reign of terror and siege because of hamas
7563838 they hamas prevented people against the geneva convention from receiving medical attention they came to israel for medical treatment we left gaza in 2005
7563839 people are starving because of hamas not because of us israelis
7563840 there is no restriction on humanitarian relief into gaza they dont need to come through the sea they can come through our passage
7563841 we are the only country today that supplies palestinians with aid it is hamas that prevents people from working living a normal life

7563844 theres a much larger population in the east and most of the rain is in the north and west

7563846 carbon taxes are part of the programme for government the sooner we grasp the nettle and comply the better because we need to send out a message that energy use has a cost for the environment
7563847 clean water will become a dwindling resource with more demand in that situation it will have a pricing component similar to that of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

7563853 informal economy hiv aids workplace policy and dissemination of international labour organisation ilo code of practice
7563854 we cannot be complacent about it as it can spread to the general population from the high risk groups
7563855 we could lose productive workforce to hiv aids and also face an adverse effect and deterioration of the business climate
7563856 programmes and policies for the informal sector is a must if hiv aids implementers are to succeed in contributing to a reduction in the spread of the disease in developing economies

7563893 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
7563894 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
7563895 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity
7563896 the elements the nepali people overthrew are again issuing challenges to bring down the maoist led government earlier than the first hundred days however they will not succeed

7563898 we are not afraid at all even if some elements boast their numbers of seats in the constituent assembly we will prove that we can sustain the government by mobilising the people
7563899 that is why one should not worry about the sustainability of the maoist led government

7563928 it is common knowledge that among all the scriptures even those of the new testament the gospels have a special preeminence and rightly so for they are the principal witness for the life and teaching of the incarnate word our savior
7563929 the church has always and everywhere held and continues to hold that the four gospels are of apostolic origin
7563930 holy mother church has firmly and with absolute constancy held and continues to hold that the four gospels just named whose historical character the church unhesitatingly asserts faithfully hand on what jesus christ while living among men really did and taught for their eternal salvation until the day he was taken up into heaven see acts 1 1

7563984 while the democrats are still gathering here in denver by all accounts their planned convention has been a complete failure meanwhile john mccain will be speaking to a crowd of more than fifteen today at the sunnyvale retirement community an agile move that will utterly upstage anything the democrats may have to offer
7563985 dang them boys really scooped me on that one i didnt think the convention even started until tonight
7563986 everyone has to put on their convention and im sure the democrats will have theirs by the way have i mentioned that im now engaged to a real live woman
7563987 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea
7563988 i share my home with my wife liz and our 2 year old cat twig we live in a townhouse in oakland that was designed by ron kappe son of l a based modern architect and sci arc founder raymond kappe the architecture draws from a mix of east bay craftsman and california modern styles i work from home so it was important to have a place that i could be excited about living and working in im in the house most of the day so having a pleasant environment to work in makes it more bearable im very much attracted to the midcentury modern aesthetic and our home reflects that the design of that period often has the perfect balance of function and form i like minimal clean design and tend to stay away from things that are overly ornamental my favorite things about our home are the giant window walls and the cathedral ceiling since our place is relatively small about 1 250 square feet the open floor plan high ceilings and large windows help create the illusion that its much more spacious than it really is i also really like our deck its great for lounging after a long day and enjoying a few drinks i found most of our furniture on craigslist the bubble lamp suspended from our living room ceiling was designed by george nelson for herman miller directly below sits a case study daybed my favorite find was our orange eames rocker which i bought for 45 we have several eames chairs but that one is my favorite my one piece of advice to others looking to decorate their homes is to buy quality furniture it might cost more up front but it will be worth it in the long run furniture that is built well will often retain its value and last a long time some of our eames chairs for instance are over 40 years old and still look great on the other hand were lucky if we can get two to three years out of some of the things weve bought from ikea ebay is another great source for quality vintage items one of my favorite ebay finds was this blue ceramic bird it has a slot on the top and a cork on the bottom so you can use it as a birdy bank i dont know much about it other than that it was made in italy and is 1 of 300 this small graphic tray is from japan and was most likely made in the late 1960s or early 1970s i also really like this el producto cigar album it was designed by paul rand now i just need to fill it with some cigars in the hallway we have a buck 65 poster designed by the small studio in france and a julia rothman print i love to be surrounded by books and art while i work so i made sure the walls were decorated with posters and that shelves with books were within reaching distance in my office i have a posters by templin brink design the small stakes hersk and olivetti the rare design books and vintage childrens books in my library often end up on my blog grain edit

7563998 the name of every organization was invariably cut down to the familiar shape that is a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllabus that would preserve the original derivation in the ministry of truth propaganda for example in which winston smith worked the recrods department was called recdep the fiction department ficdep even in the early decades of the 20th century telescoped words and phrases had been on of the characteristic features of political language and it had been noticed thatthe tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian organizations such words as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most of the that associations that would otherwise cling to it comintern refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited in purpose s a chair or a table comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily in the same way the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care which was taken to make every word easily pronounceable

7564004 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7564005 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7564006 it was too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream especially when i realized that many of them have supported my musical career
7564007 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7564008 shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7564011 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7564012 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7564013 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7564014 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7564015 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry

7564031 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7564032 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7564033 these people are giving a bad name to their country
7564034 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
7564035 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
7564036 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
7564037 when things do go wrong they go wrong in quite a big way
7564038 what were trying to do here is reduce some of these avoidable accidents where they have so much to drink that they fall off balconies and are either killed or need huge operations
7564039 british tour operators present them with these packages that promise a wild holiday in malia
7564040 this predisposes them they are automatically put into a wild and lawless mind set that is beyond them

7564049 and then presented this to the public the idea that those who didnt support were
7564050 thats what im talking about and what im afraid could happen if obama and the authoritarian left comes into power

7564056 she shared that one of the highlights of being on smallville was working with james marsters she grew up watching buffy and was a big fan to the point of writing joss whedon when she was a kid and asking if she could be on the show years later vandervoort had the chance to audition for whedon who remembered her letter
7564057 i think so were still evaluating were still trying to decide what to do and im hoping the dust will be settling down by today
7564058 i hope we know whose going to go play and start and all those things im not sure well have every answer but some of those answers might be to play two or three guys at certain spot to see who can do it the best
7564059 everybodys definitely excited were just ready to get this season underway
7564060 we know its a tough schedule thats why we have to take it as it comes
7564061 theres no way we can get ahead of ourselves with a schedule like this
7564062 ive been very pleased this camp because hes really taken it upon himself to be focused every day and really knew the goal coming in that we wanted him to become more efficient offensively thats started with him
7564063 ive felt if he played better our receivers would play better and no doubt theres no denying that our receivers are better because theyve had another year of experience but weve also had a lot of injuries this camp and been limited but he has still been extremely accurate and i think everybodys play has picked up around him
7564064 its losing sturdivant going to affect us a lot we were coming along nicely before he got hurt but weve got guys there who have the opportunity to step up and well be conscientious of that as were getting ready to game plan
7564065 it will be on a basis on how we do things and execute things and were struggling to execute certain things we may curtail some of the offense protection wise but that could have been the same thing if trinton had been there one guy is not going to make a unit dominant its got to be five cohesive guys
7564066 im concerned about the depth at safety in regards to experience were pretty set at corner with experience but we cant afford to lose another safety
7564067 the type of player that q is and experience he brings will be missed so thats a concern as far as practice and how theyre preparing theyre doing fine
7564068 ive been coming to the fair since i was a wee girl and im 61 now
7564069 my father made it and his mother did before him
7564070 the children grow up making it and help out and thats how they learn it they each have a certain job to do theyll never tell whats in it
7564071 ive made plenty of friends coming here and the craic is good
7564072 one flashpoint is the assigned speech topic for former president bill clinton who is scheduled to speak wednesday night when the convention theme is securing americas future the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas
7564073 this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7564074 team continues to act like she and bill clinton hold leverage
7564075 on this one my hunch is politico is right i recall that in 2000 gore aides told me they had no more delicate convention task than telling the clintons that they wanted them to make an appearance and leave
7564076 s ources back up the politico to a point things are getting a little hairy as the reality of the convention sets in obama aides acknowledge that there has been some recent bumps on the road but insist that reports of boiled over anger are way overplayed
7564077 another point of tension sources say is that the obama campaign is aware that mark penn is advising bill clinton on the speech obamas campaign doesnt like mark penn
7564078 i think pam needs to come clean as the video speaks for itself and that is evidence that a person cannot deny
7564079 a cocktail of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day
7564080 he is a loving father who has had his name smeared
7564081 you can hear and see pam acknowledging it was ok
7564082 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7564083 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier he faced criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7564084 and john kennedy replied the world is changing the old ways will not do it is time for a new generation of leadership
7564085 my three children are here lots of cousins are here obviously many of the robert kennedys are here
7564086 its the 40th anniversary of robert f kennedys presidential campaign so i think for all our family this is incredibly emotional
7564087 i woke up alone the next morning pain all around my groin and lower abdomen i started to whimper like a whipped dog so this is what syphilis is like i thought i suppose i deserve it but christ how the hell was i to know
7564088 it began to sink in shatner my understudy would have to go on it instantly brought back the pain i screamed for a nurse who jabbed me with more morphine
7564089 i knew then that the sob was going to be a star
7564090 democrats usually defeat themselves if theyre defeated and they usually elect themselves when theyre united
7564091 so my plea to you is please lets get this family together and win this election this fall
7564092 as much as we will have different needs that will come up over the next few days they are important nothing is more important than this delegation in a united way getting over any personal issues or anything else and reaching across finding common ground and making sure that we come out of here incredibly united are you ready to do that
7564093 democrats usually defeat themselves if theyre defeated and they usually elect themselves when theyre united
7564094 youve got to be ready because thats what im going to say at the beginning of my convention speech so i need you guys to be loud and to be there
7564095 let me talk about maybe the first and most basic difference they believe that prosperity comes from the top its trickle down
7564096 we think when the middle class is doing well and youre building millions of houses thats what makes prosperity

7564101 global food wastage must be halved by 2025 to meet the challenges of feeding the rapidly growing population and preserving global water supplies
7564102 as much as half the water used to grow food world wide is lost due to waste
7564103 roughly fifty percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
7564104 weak policy poor management increasing waste and exploding water demands are pushing the planet towards the tipping point of global water crisis
7564105 to place an effective water saving strategy requiring that food wastage be minimised firmly on the political agenda

7564119 he was more than willing to do whatever he could do in the best interests of the team
7564120 there hasnt been any discussion that ive been involved in
7564121 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7564122 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7564123 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7564124 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7564125 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7564126 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
7564127 the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7564128 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7564129 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november

7564133 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7564134 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7564135 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7564136 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7564137 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7564138 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces

7564150 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7564151 last week was the low of lows i guess could you say for our race team
7564152 you know theres not one specific place i was sitting there pointing fingers at i just thought as a race team we just werent getting the job done the driver is a big part of that race team so i felt like there were a lot of things i could have done different throughout the summer but for the most part mechanical failures ailed us if we can put a halt to that we are going to go out there and win races as often as kyle busch is we are going to at least be a top five top 10 car every week if you can do that then youre going to put yourself in position to be a championship contender because you know theres going to be weeks when guys have bad weeks weve just got to get there right now
7564153 we needed it at this point a lot of the guys right behind me finished in the top 10 also we gained a little bit on a couple guys in front of us but this is what we needed all we can ask for is a top three finish and if we do that its going to work itself out in three races but we cant help how good or bad they run
7564154 it wasnt the best racecar that we put on the racetrack but it was a really good racecar
7564155 we had good track position through qualifying and great pit stops everything really worked out it was kind of a flawless night in a way we just didnt have the car to go up there and battle for the lead but still had a great car a good night for us
7564156 courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than ones fear
7564157 if you want to buy a great company dirt cheap think
7564158 biogen recently got hammered on bad news that wasnt actually so bad biib and partner
7564159 its important to note here that the two companies had predicted that one in 1000 cases could develop pml and the fda let the drug come to market with this understanding with a strong set of patient warnings and physician follow up
7564160 tysabri has succeeded in the marketplace because it is a superior treatment for ms and the patients who use it agree despite its high cost of 30 000 per year
7564161 biib is still targeting 100 000 patients by 2010 and that would translate into 1 billion per quarter in sales
7564162 biogen idec also has the ability to add new products through licensing or direct acquisition and i expect it to do so in the coming quarters this temporary downturn is a godsend for investors biib is now selling well below the valuations of other large cap double digit biotech growers take advantage of this mistake before the street wakes up
7564163 the two hottest device launches to date could lead to the greatest subscriber quarter in rogers history when it launches third quarter 2008 results
7564164 these two products alone will be a huge catalyst to this stock in the coming quarters
7564165 revenue growth at rogers wireless stands to improve and while initial phone subsidies may pressure margins in the near term cash flow benefits will quickly follow
7564166 methinks its kinda symbolic of the whole obama candidacy its all about fake faux phony false and the tacky biden hair job is just the latest extension the latest symbolism of this fraudulent presidential candidate and his whole crew
7564167 she has a passion for central and truly knows this college kathy will be able to extend centrals annual fund success
7564168 when i left central almost 10 years ago i didnt think there would be another opportunity for me to rejoin the best team i have ever worked with so i consider the opportunity to direct the annual fund a dream come true
7564169 the beauty of the central fund is participation is just as important as the amount given and my hope is we can continue to increase both
7564170 she had a tube top thing pushed down below all the folds
7564171 i wonder if maybe they were putting on a show for me
7564172 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7564173 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7564174 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7564175 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7564176 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7564177 bicyclists on the other hand expend a lot of effort getting up to speed cranking up the momentum every single block and then giving it all up at every single stop sign gets old really fast so whenever there is any question whether to stop or not such as when there is little oppositional traffic at stop signs or anywhere else for that matter s he understandably doesnt stop doesnt give up his or her hard won momentum that is to say after a while if one bikes all the time a pattern or habit gets established thats what you and the complainers are witnessing

7564183 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
7564184 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
7564185 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
7564186 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
7564187 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan

7564192 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7564193 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7564194 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7564195 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7564196 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7564197 the enemy has advanced faster than we expected as you can see his camp is already within a days march of the city we have not yet repaired the walls nor have we enough supplies to withstand a siege if we allow ourselves to be invested oldburg will fall
7564198 we command the seas and can keep oldburg supplied indefinitely even now whitespire is assembling additional stocks of food for transport here
7564199 duke brassos we appreciate everything the pylean league has done but it is only a matter of time before the dark lords sorcerers succeed in blocking the harbor either by using infernal machines magic or summoning sea beasts
7564200 there is no retreat to boatenburg or whitespire or kingsdell or even
7564201 king alarion i know elves are loathe to give advice but you alone have seen similar dark times
7564202 what can i say that you do not already know king otto of godenland upon this battle the hinge of fate will turn i do not believe that we will fail but many of us here will not see todays sun set i was at the declean hills back when you thraciots were as children you were fewer then and your weapons not as deadly but you had the mastery for you kept faith with your gods and trusted each other i can also recall the ruin you inflicted upon yourselves when you abandoned both policies
7564203 then it is long since time that we returned to the wisdom of our fathers
7564204 your chariots will be most successful on the left wing for the ground is flatter and firmer there also there is the coast road close at hand to get you around any obstacles
7564205 your majesty additional levies arrived last night giving us three thousand foot and five hundred horse
7564206 good i want the infantry there but the cavalry shall be with me
7564207 next to your infantry we will put our small but noble detachment from weirland
7564208 the feud between our countries is ancient but let us hope todays battle brings better days to come
7564209 that was the wish of king osric as well your majesty
7564210 your grace i will place the pylean troops next to weirland you come provided with many archers and crossbowmen and they will stand here to cover your flank and support me
7564211 with the pyleans will be the detachments from aquilea and hesperia
7564212 i had wondered how you would relay messages to our detachments but keeping us with the pyleans is wise for we all speak the same language
7564213 i did not fancy my men trying to wrap their tongues around hesperian
7564214 i will be here with the sacred knights and the chivalry of godenland the ostmark suebia and all others fit to ride
7564215 next to us will be the infantry of godenland and the ostmark
7564216 though their numbers are few i would also like the dwarves sent by king thrar to take their place with my people
7564217 we stand with you king otto and honor our ancient alliance
7564218 we only regret that the great distance has kept so few of our people from coming
7564219 lord gunnar every warrior you have sent is worth his weight in gold
7564220 i am relying on you to hold the hinge at the center
7564221 finally with your majestys leave i entrust our right wing to king alarion the ageless and his host from the alfenwald
7564222 your plan is bold king otto but our need requires it
7564223 let us speak no longer but form our companies for already the suns first rays touch the eastern horizon
7564224 my lords to your companies and may thracios bless us
7564225 well as i looked into the eyes of alarion i felt as though my life was passing before my eyes but it was a life i have not yet lived
7564226 no it was as if the battle did not happen
7564227 but i do know we have no time for elvish riddles the armies slowly filed out of the two western gates of oldburg
7564228 when the sun bursts forth then it shall be our time
7564229 i did your majesty my name is aldred and i am or was a nobleman from heathdale
7564230 i am a knight of thracios your majesty as you are i have pledged my life to him and today he will claim it or not as is his need
7564231 you comfort me aldred of heathdale ride with me and stay at my side during the battle you are young but there is wisdom in your words
7564232 why do you come before king otto iii of godenland in manner of war
7564233 it is plain to see you offer me war and conquest
7564234 o mighty king otto of godenland you are the greatest ruler of the age
7564235 the true emperor recognizes your quality and offers you this crown to signify your achievement
7564236 it will cast a spell on us or overthrow his mind
7564237 you shall rule as viceroy to his imperial majesty the king of kings you shall choose a place for your seat and it shall be the capital of all the world the boreans will serve you as they serve the true emperor and through his power your reign will never end
7564238 tell your dark master that i want no share of his rulership and none of his unnatural gifts a king i am but i am also a mortal man and such i shall remain
7564239 a man you shall remain and shortly you will taste the mortality you have chosen

7564285 rightly or mistakenly theres a suspicion that selected banks will announce another round of write offs
7564286 second banks are coming to grips with the reality of the global slowdown the slowdown suggests reduced revenue for banks which would further hurt already strained balance sheets and make banks more reluctant to lend
7564287 only after banks become confident in those they are lending to so long as banks believe some in their sector may be hiding losses the bias will be toward pulling back lending activity and thats reflected in higher rates

7564301 el partido ante el schalke 04 es uno de los m s importantes que vamos a vivir estamos preparados para enfrentarnos a este momento es un partido muy importante para los jugadores para el club y para la afici n y somos conscientes de ello el vicente calder n estar lleno y nos sobra la motivaci n lo importante por encima de todo es ganar
7564302 un rival muy duro y est muy fuerte f sicamente
7564303 la mayor a de los compa eros son jugadores con mucha experiencia jugaron con la selecci n en el mundial y creo que no iremos a lo loco como nos pasaba en a os anteriores yo estoy b rbaro ahora jugaremos m s en equipo y de una manera m s vertical
7564304 tienen jugadores que controlan muy bien el bal n y van a tratar de jugar al contragolpe por ello nosotros mantendremos un grupo muy cerrado en la mitad de la cancha
7564305 la competencia est m s fuerte este a o que el pasado
7564306 por lo que le pas a lafita desgraciadamente se abri una oportunidad para m y la estoy afrontando con la ilusi n de ganarme la titularidad poco a poco todos somos conscientes de que la competencia est m s fuerte este a o que el pasado y nadie se quiere quedar fuera
7564307 desde m punto de vista aqu no hay once mejores todos tenemos calidad es una plantilla muy buena y no se puede hablar de un s lo once
7564308 nos jugamos mucho en estos dos partidos igual no tanto en el de liga porque es el inicio y todav a faltar a mucho pero s por el rival al que nos enfrentamos de todas formas estamos pensando en el jueves en el pase a la uefa todos estamos muy ilusionados y queremos seguir con ese sue o europeo del que tanto hablamos
7564309 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7564310 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s al f tbol europeo so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos en mi segundo a o aqu estoy a un pasito de jugar en europa y todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7564311 escuchaba que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7564312 ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal pueda darse un partido bueno para nosotros con m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7564313 no es nada nuevo ni sorprendente que un equipo como el real madrid haya sacado adelante un partido como el de la supercopa porque tiene grandes figuras somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor
7564314 jugaremos con mucha motivaci n porque queremos seguir manteniendo la racha de invictos ante el real madrid que es de muchos a os se habla ya de una tradici n

7564357 hes got to use the convention to show people clearly what he intends to do to make their lives better
7564358 in economically sensitive places like ohio and michigan people need to know what his bottom line is they want to know what he will do to get them working again

7564616 ive been told the president has been aware of someone he feels would be able to teach one or more courses and has sought to offer those individuals positions without submission of applications

7564638 i have been trying to talk about the positives but some people are more concerned about the negative aspects if there are any
7564639 the means to get more players in is there that has been established we have a number of situations that could be resolved in the next few days
7564640 we want to bring in good players to complement those already here that is what we are trying to do in the remaining part of the window

7564643 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7564644 i continually hear from people all over the world that my act of coming out especially when i did in 1975 has empowered them in their search for self and to see their vision
7564645 hopefully my million dollar pledge will influence others to support the university and the q center to continue to help others to do just that
7564646 in each media market the presidential race is too close to call

7564721 avalanches are possible in the swiss alps in summer if it snows for a few days above 3 000 metres
7564722 the mont blancs very popular and busy but compared with the number of people who try there are only a few accidents on this mountain in summer some days we have over 100 000 visitors a day in chamonix 100 deaths a year in the alps is not a lot when you compare with car accidents
7564723 when we have good weather more people go out to the mountains

7564761 the origin of this skills problem lies in the decline of the family in american society dysfunctional families retard the formation of the abilities needed for successful performance in modern society
7564762 it is a relief because usually in these situations it comes down to the players at the last minute to make the decision

7564815 the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington
7564816 b iden is anything but a change agent having been in office longer than half of all americans have been alive
7564817 the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution
7564818 obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7564819 obama may decry lobbyist cash or at least federal lobbyist cash but biden has taken 344 400 from lobbyists since 1997 making lobbyists the 10th biggest contributing industry that seems a direct contradiction of the obama message
7564820 at the same time as a 36 year senate veteran biden is a washington insider an image that is at odds with the theme of change obama has promoted
7564821 the decision to go with biden 65 a washington insider over a younger politician with a lesser known national profile such as obamas friend virginia gov tim kaine reflects how tight the contest is between obama and republican john mccain
7564822 obama names sen joe biden as his vice presidential pick
7564823 on the downside biden is a consummate washington insider he was first elected to the senate in 1973 at the age of 29 and plagiarism charges forced him from the 1988 presidential contest
7564824 well the downside is this is a campaign of change who is selecting which is selecting a man whos been in the senate for over three decades there is that
7564825 biden has been in the united states senate for 36 years he was elected in 1972 the year barack obama turned eleven making him for better or worse a quintessential washington insider
7564826 t heres the 2007 abc interview in which biden said he would stand by an earlier statement that obama was not ready to serve as president it seems obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree
7564827 obama all but confessed his lack of knowledge of foreign affairs by selecting as his running mate the senates senior democratic leader on that topic
7564828 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7564829 he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience
7564830 o bama has spent the last 2 years discounting the experience of folks in the bush administration discounting the experience of hillary clinton and now discounting the experience of john mccain by saying that what matters is judgment not the number of years someone has spent in washington obamas pick belies that notion especially since the core of obamas judgment argument centers on his opposing the iraq war from the beginning joe biden voted for the iraq war
7564831 for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7564832 the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden pick is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image
7564833 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7564834 its a measure of how badly the last month has gone for the once high flying obama campaign that theyre willing to risk taking on board a shoot from the lip running mate like biden
7564835 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address at a time when national polls suggest that his race with senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is tightening
7564836 as the associated presss ron fournier noted in an analysis this morning picking biden shows that obama and his team are concerned that questions of whether the illinois senator is ready for the job have the potential to be politically dangerous
7564837 o ne quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things
7564838 the central mystery for those who have watched biden over the years is this how could someone so smart experienced and articulate be his own worst enemy by saying just the wrong thing at just the wrong moment
7564839 bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th if its biden here we go again
7564840 i mean if the obama campaign when they knew this pick was coming they realized bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th they know this they understand this theyre willing to take that risk if its biden here we go again
7564841 the big other problem is that biden has had a tendency to make gaffes on the trail hes not always very disciplined
7564842 he cant keep his mouth shut sometimes he talks before thinking he is not always a systematic thinker he loves to hear himself talk he can get carried away with his enthusiasms
7564843 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7564844 but he can also be a motormouth who veers wildly off message
7564845 but while biden 65 made strides during the primary season on curbing his legendary penchant for leaving no thought unspoken those who have watched him and listened to him over the years know the obama team will spend some sleepless nights wondering what he might say at any given moment

7564865 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7564881 we are making all out efforts to prevent a drift toward an imf assisted bailout that would obviously cause more difficulties as it would be governed by strings that are hard to fulfil
7564882 that is going to be the day when this country would have to decide as to how the two countries would be submitted with an agenda for the loan and on what terms
7564883 there is a consensus evolved in these meetings on averting a drift back to the imf mechanizations a week ago some of the imf officials did visit islamabad to offer a package and it was a soft mark up deal its tranche payment mechanism was attractive too as the fund seemed ready to release 500 million every month which is close to what the actual requirement over the current financial years 12 month period would be but the strings attached would be too harsh to meet
7564884 i am not supposed to handout half cooked measures but the main idea is that saudi arabia should be offering a deferred payment scheme for the current fiscal year on provision of petroleum products imported from that country it should be a 12 month scheme covered by assurances that the products would be used to keep the prices stable and no further loans would be acquired from other internal or external sources against the facility thus extended which is not a harsh string
7564885 the crunch has begun telling too adversely to sustain any further
7564886 that would mean an immediate jump in the inflationary trend which would directly be impacting the export production lines which is not acceptable to pakistan

7564963 with communication and cell phones this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now you are announced at the district level and cell phones go wild so by the time you go to the capital if you have changed the figures they will know and you will be caught out
7564964 internet provides groups in society with means to communicate organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government but only a tiny percentage of african populations have access to internet
7564965 during the 2006 local government elections in senegal radio sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw i remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station this was reported live as it was happening
7564966 parallel reporting was important in zimbabwe it kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result
7564967 all of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating
7564968 the more transparency and the more information that can be circulated outside the hands of government is a good thing but the other side of that is that a lot of misinformation can get out that way also
7564969 it doesnt mean anything unless you have all of the means of verifying the results if you have a ruling authoritarian regime which is determined to cheat they will do it
7564970 africans have been able to organize without technology freedom of association the right to organize autonomous organizations and function freely is more important than access to new technology in fostering democracy
7564971 that said new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments between civil society organizations and the public informed citizens are essential to good functioning of democracies
7564972 authoritarian regimes want to control and monopolize the flow of information african authoritarian regimes dont have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information
7564973 new technology is not a panacea but it can speed up processes of democratization and should be encouraged

7565051 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible i know people are angry and rightfully so
7565052 i am prepared to take all that responsibility for the good of the team i still back the players do they suddenly become bad players or is there something else wrong
7565053 we should have won the opportunities were there but we just let them slip im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played its just that final thing we are missing either a pass not going to hand or someone having the wrong body position and losing the ball in contact or not working hard enough in support

7565058 no tenemos intenci n de ir contra un gobierno establecido por mecanismos democr ticos s lo exigimos como ciudadanos que se respete y se honre la voluntad del pueblo al haber rechazado la reforma constitucional impulsada por el gobierno
7565059 with his bolivarian revolution discredited both at home and abroad chavezs desperate hope is that militaristic nationalism will strike a chord
7565060 he claims absurdly that he is preparing for a u s invasion in fact his military buildup is intended to consolidate his power and intimidate his neighbors
7565061 although the full extent of mr chavezs mismanagement has been camouflaged by high energy prices he is wrecking the venezuelan economy
7565062 the health care system has deteriorated alarmingly and food shortages remain a persistent problem
7565063 corruption is widespread and rampant crime has earned the capital caracas its reputation as the most dangerous city in the western hemisphere

7565066 desde m punto de vista aqu no hay once mejores todos tenemos calidad es una plantilla muy buena y no se puede hablar de un s lo once
7565067 nos jugamos mucho en estos dos partidos igual no tanto en el de liga porque es el inicio y todav a faltar a mucho pero s por el rival al que nos enfrentamos de todas formas estamos pensando en el jueves en el pase a la uefa todos estamos muy ilusionados y queremos seguir con ese sue o europeo del que tanto hablamos
7565068 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7565069 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s al f tbol europeo so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos en mi segundo a o aqu estoy a un pasito de jugar en europa y todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7565070 escuchaba que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7565071 ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal pueda darse un partido bueno para nosotros con m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7565072 no es nada nuevo ni sorprendente que un equipo como el real madrid haya sacado adelante un partido como el de la supercopa porque tiene grandes figuras somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor
7565073 jugaremos con mucha motivaci n porque queremos seguir manteniendo la racha de invictos ante el real madrid que es de muchos a os se habla ya de una tradici n

7565109 if youre catholic and you disagree with your church what do you do you change your mind
7565110 shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose
7565111 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7565112 abortion always deliberately kills an innocent unborn child nobody can honestly claim to be a faithful catholic and then support a false right to abortion its just an elegant way of evading the brutality of what abortion actually does
7565113 if youre catholic and you disagree with your church what do you do you change your mind
7565114 obviously there is a great deal of excitement in this country about the birth
7565115 do you think it will be the same all over europe
7565116 itll be absolute bedlam as you can see already well probably have to whitewash the windows to give her some peace but well rig up a closed circuit television screen outside and if people happen to be here at the time of the birth fair enough
7565117 by the standards of other mammals we would say she was pregnant
7565118 but without any laboratory data on pregnant pandas we cannot be certain you cant just leap in there with ultrasonic equipment and say sit to a giant panda
7565119 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7565120 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7565121 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7565122 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7565123 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7565124 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7565125 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7565126 its not in our hands top four finish but weve given ourselves an opportunity if we win our last game it makes it very interesting and were looking forward to it
7565127 theres an awful lot of ability and resolve in that side and that showed in the second half
7565128 we were dreadful for large parts of the game and we were very lethargic but the response was fantastic
7565129 we were fairly good in the first half but we didnt take some good enough decisions on our last plays we had the opportunity to put the boot in but we came up with some really poor kicks
7565130 we didnt get as excited without the ball as we did with the ball and thats been an issue for the last six or seven weeks
7565131 i think weve made progress this year were disappointed with some performances but sometimes weve exceeded expectations

7565150 die etappen sind schnell und technisch herausfordernd aber die autos leiden nicht aus der sicht des fahrers ist es sicher eine meiner lieblings veranstaltungen im letzten jahr haben wir den sieg um haaresbreite verpasst ich werde mich in diesem jahr nicht revanchieren k nnen weil marcus gr nholm nicht mehr dabei ist aber es verspricht auch so ein sehr enger wettbewerb zu werden wir m ssen als erster auf die strecke aber wie gro der nachteil sein wird wird von den bedingungen abh ngen da hier einige etappen nur einmal gefahren werden k nnten wir hier schon viel zeit verlieren der schl ssel wird aber sein ein setup zu finden dass optimal mit den harten reifen arbeitet
7565151 es ist ein weiter weg um hierher zu kommen aber ich liebe die neuseel ndischen etappen und auch das land selbst du kannst dich hier wirklich auf das fahren konzentrieren und musst keine angst haben das auto zu besch digen die geschwindigkeit ist so hoch dass es unerl sslich ist ein gutes gef hl f r das terrain zu haben und hier fehlt mir vielleicht immer noch ein bisschen erfahrung unsere leistung aus finnland zeigt aber dass eine gute platzierung m glich ist ich werde die drei tage sehr vorsichtig angehen auch wenn ich am ende sehr gerne wieder auf dem podium stehen w rde
7565152 die strecke selbst ist ziemlich langsam denn es gibt viele kurven und die geraden sind kurz das k nnte w hrend des rennens aber helfen
7565153 die strecke mag ich sehr voriges jahr lief es im training gut aber im rennen hatte ich dann ein mechanisches problem also habe ich dort noch was zu erledigen

7565173 if they feel like having a pie and a few beers theyll have a pie and a few beers
7565174 at the end of the day they cant move the more trendy stuff
7565175 a good meat pie is chunky and nice and tender
7565176 it doesnt worry me what brand it is as long as its nice and fresh
7565177 there are more people going to venues and more events held at the mcg

7565184 i dont know why we stayed out midway through the race when the car in front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up any track position everything we did was wrong
7565185 should we drill even though it almost certainly wont lower gas prices

7565190 there are so many options these days in both the new and used car realm for safe fun and affordable back to school rides
7565191 vehicles are better built and better equipped than ever before and there are a variety of body style options available to suit the needs of any parent and inevitably satisfy the wants of any teen
7565192 i havent heard a word about how well his matches went i watched his match in moline and it was o k not bad not great it looks like morishima might want to focus on his athletic conditioning and hit the gym more frequently i am not being negative here only realistic morishima has something that seems like it might be worth exploring i like his timing and there is no doubt potential with this young man
7565193 i never look for steve to wrestle again but as i have said regarding this mattter many times i hope that i am wrong as far as creating revenue no wrestler that i know has ever generated more money than austin in a given year does that make steve the all time best some would say yes
7565194 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7565195 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels

7565208 she remembered one faculty member as having said that schweitzer would end up either in jail or as governor
7565209 perhaps the single most insightful thing ive heard said about him
7565210 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7565211 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7565212 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7565213 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7565214 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7565215 i love it and im not ready to give it up
7565216 i was getting ready for work and heard a big explosion

7565238 whether it wouldnt be better for me to do it with a knife most of the best things have been brought off with a knife and it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a french president and wriggle it round
7565239 the knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant dynamite is not only our best tool but our best symbol it is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the christians it expands it only destroys because it broadens even so thought only destroys because it broadens a mans brain is a bomb

7565248 we have spun out this farce long enough i have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs long inured to our levities might hear some new seriousness in my voice comrades we were discussing plans and naming places i propose before saying anything else that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member i suggest comrade saturday dr bull
7565249 not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company

7565264 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7565265 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7565266 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7565267 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7565268 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

7565273 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7565274 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7565275 its not only or necessarily ahmadinejad who speaks to the imam
7565276 theres a whole new second generation elite of the revolutionary guard irgc who indoctrinate their troops with the belief in the need to hasten the advent of the imam this has also spread to hizballah in lebanon
7565277 he represents a larger elite and wider trend hence he is more dangerous since even if he were to disappear through elections or other means the trend he represents would remain strong this is in contrast to hitler who had he disappeared even as late as 1939 there is great doubt that wwii would have occurred
7565278 the need for the imams loyalists to have the strategic upper hand is a necessary condition for his appearance the upper hand can only be achieved through possession of nuclear weapons
7565279 balance between the supreme leader and the president is no longer clearly in the favor of the former as it was with ahmadinejads predecessors now the president has the direct support of the revolutionary guard the regimes mainstay
7565280 some iran experts believe that ahmadinejad is irrelevant since real power is in the hands of pragmatic clerics this ignores the fundamental shift that has occurred in iran since ahmadinjeads election ahmadjinejad and the revolutionary guards represent a powerful force which can crush domestic opposition this has changed the fundamental balance of power in iran ahmadinejads ability to influence issues of national security goes far beyond any of his predecessors as he proved in his manipulation of the nuclear issue and relations with the west frequently against the wishes of the supreme leader the faction that takes credit for providing iran with a military nuclear capability will grow even stronger as iran comes closer to that goal thats why sanctions wont work they cant work
7565281 the problem isnt that ahmadinejad will unilaterally give an order to attack but the irgcs policy of escalation and brinkmanship could push the entire region to the brink of a nuclear confrontation and then leave no choice but to attack most wars were not premeditated but rather developed out of bad estimates of the situation and what the response would be from the other side
7565282 the very nature of brinkmanship in the middle east can create an escalation of nuclear crisis that can quickly spiral out of control
7565283 this guy has seen me perform at some point and he recognizes my fine self

7565286 con algunos prejuicios sobre que se hacen monjas las chicas menos atractivas
7565287 fotos bonitas y expresivas que muestren la belleza tanto en el plano est tico como espiritual
7565288 una monja santa inteligente pero tambi n guapa puede dar mucho en la misi n de la evangelizaci n y de la pastoral juvenil
7565289 vivimos en tiempos en los que la visibilidad es muy importante y puede servir a las monjas para que se conozca su instituto o el carisma de una fundaci n religiosa
7565290 la imagen que se tiene de que las monjas son mujeres tristes desilusionadas de la vida y no realizadas
7565291 at this very special moment for me i really want to send a message to the chelsea fans who in the past two years have always made me feel their support

7565305 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7565306 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7565307 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7565315 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7565316 uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7565317 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7565318 authority and responsibilities of the international forces in the country must be regulated through a status of force agreement
7565319 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7565320 everyone who took part in the meeting believes in the possibility of working together
7565321 we want to unite our efforts starting from information and ending with money
7565322 the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins necessitates our allocating these coins among the authorized purchasers on a weekly basis until we are able to meet demand
7565323 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
7565324 a subsidiary of the north american islamic trust which is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia

7565403 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7565404 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7565405 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7565406 life is good festivals positive products and a steady dose of ping pong
7565407 but life is good has also become something of an anthem for survivors the founders receive thousands of letters from people whose lives are demonstrably not good because they are sick or have lost a loved one where other companies supply their stores with headquarters authored mission and values statements life is good provides loose leaf binders labeled fuel and stuffed with thank yous from people who have taken solace or inspiration from its message michael j fox suffering from parkinsons disease has been photographed wearing life is good products so was stephen king during his long convalescence after being struck by a van
7565408 one reason i initially missed the charm of life is good is that i misinterpreted its message

7565420 man ferrostaal has warned the sunday times that their false allegations of bribery are damaging to current negotiations for the construction of oil and gas platforms in the companys offset projects in saldanha bay western cape province and cape town this might endanger the creation of thousands of jobs
7565421 international companies react very sensitively to bribery allegations and i am concerned that your false allegations might have a negative impact on these negotiations
7565422 your false allegations in the sunday times articles from august 3 and august 10 not only put the creation of jobs at risk but also jeopardizes the return of a promising industry to sa
7565423 no donations to any political party were in any way part of the contracting process
7565424 together with partners we have arranged and we are in the process of arranging investments totalling several billions of rand creating and retaining several thousands of jobs

7565426 we want to unite our efforts starting from information and ending with money
7565427 small countries raised objections and it was not without the knowledge of the us
7565428 after thorough deliberations and keeping all the recent developments into view the party pml n has decided to split with the ruling coalition
7565429 we assured asif zardari of support without even receiving any ministry but he forced us into getting ministries and our ministers took oath of their office from the then president musharraf despite having reservations
7565430 facing severe internal and external pressure i wrote a detailed letter to co chairman ppp asif ali zardari and allowed him time to ensure implementation on the agreements
7565431 but zardari in an interview said agreements are not holy qur an or hadith which cannot be changed
7565432 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7565433 uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7565434 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7565435 authority and responsibilities of the international forces in the country must be regulated through a status of force agreement
7565436 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7565437 after 2011 no foreign soldiers will no longer be in iraq
7565438 i go and train farmers in various villages at block and district level the farmers have even understood that worm compost production is necessary for them so that they can have good production and increase their earnings
7565439 earlier we were facing much hardship since we couldn t afford to buy the chemical fertilizers as they were too costly since the time we have been associated with chetna bharti basanti has taught us how to produce manure using earthworms since then we are rearing earthworms and using these as a catalyst in production of rich compost for our fields many villagers even buy the manure from us at rupees six per kilogram so much so we also sell a quintal or two to chetna bharti this way we make a decent earning for our daily bread as well as educate our kids
7565440 you ever wonder what your last moments would be like on a crashing plane what or who would you do
7565441 you should tell more people around the world about americas non mainstream agriculture and food system then they wont hate you so much
7565442 the trust provider requirements and market access program are at least a step in the right direction
7565443 its not the system that is flawed but it is only some of the members that are flawed
7565444 please continue to share data on fair traders you know about where does the money go
7565445 it may be that the system is flawed and it is the members who are fine
7565446 its about continually looking at your work force and looking at your economic projections and trying to bring those in line
7565447 we thought that we had that two months ago but with the worsening economy we just need to do more
7565448 obviously you can do more if you have more people
7565449 our approach through this whole period of downsizing has been to prioritize and well continue to do that

7565455 we are at a firm stage and with a pride we can say we have around 70 challenged students and 700 of normal students and they re interacting very well and the society also accepts it
7565456 earlier i did not keep him in any special school because of his sleeping timings and he was small there was a school where they keep normal kids but there was no one who d watch over him i took him out and after coming here my kid is kept along with other children where they are specially taught how to wear clothes and other special kind of teachings that s why i kept my child here

7565464 kimi needs to shift up a gear if he carries on in this fashion formula one will simply shred him
7565465 kimi was always automatically fired up for any race but perhaps those flames arent buring quite so bright any more
7565466 that was pathetic he started ahead of rosberg and crossed the finishing line after him a constructor such as bmw cant afford a situation like that im not blaming heidfeld himself its simply that the car doesnt suit him
7565467 an important thing is to consider the basic desires of people even if all youre thinking about is a simple game

7565469 should gordon brown make good his threat to support this criminality for the sake of oil uk citizens and interests in nigeria will suffer the consequences
7565470 we stand ready to give help to the nigerians to deal with lawlessness that exists in this area and to achieve the levels of production that nigeria is capable of but because of the law and order problems has not been able to achieve
7565471 they ought to know better than any other country not to involve themselves in any other area aside from development they the british are getting frustrated and we will continue frustrating the oil dependent markets until justice is offered
7565472 it will not get to that point except if there is foreign interference
7565473 we are not structured or resourced to do two of these things iraq and afghanistan on this scale on an enduring basis but we have been doing it on an enduring basis for years until we get to the stage when one of them comes down to small scale we will be stretched beyond the capability we have
7565474 it would be utterly extraordinary to propose anything like a sizeable deployment of forces to nigeria where are they going to come from the mod has not exactly got a box marked new troops they can open up for something like this
7565475 it would be possible to send special forces in limited numbers to help the nigerian military but with the current situation in afghanistan they cannot be kept there for anything like a prolonged period

7565983 visualcv is committed to changing the way recruiting and career management are conducted online and intridea is a strategic partner in that effort
7565984 the power of mediaplug for managing rich media has helped us to redefine the resume experience
7565985 the deep ruby on rails expertise at intridea and within our own team allowed us to engage in collaborative agile development in which the mediaplug integration efforts moved forward even as we were developing the core visualcv application
7565986 we went from engaging intridea in october 2007 to delivering alpha code in december and then launching our public beta in february 2008 this allowed visualcv to begin gathering real user feedback in a period of less than five months
7565987 through its leverage of amazon web services intridea mediaplug removed several of the cost and infrastructure management hurdles to bringing our disruptive concept to market

7565990 he must have gone out and realised he only got 30 and came back in for some more
7565991 she thought he was joking at first when he asked for the money and said she wasnt going to give it but then he brought the gun out and she was quite scared
7565992 it brought back memories it is not nice you do think it is a joke at first
7565993 we dont feel safe working here certainly not at the moment but we dont want him to get the better of us
7565994 a white man wearing a crash helmet and black clothing including gloves made off with an amount of money having threatened a shop assistant with a hand gun he ran across the shop car park towards belmont road
7565995 there were two female occupants inside the car and we believe they were both taken to hospital suffolk homes
7565996 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
7565997 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7565998 some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
7565999 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
7566000 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
7566001 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7566002 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7566003 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7566004 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
7566005 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2006 goal of 5
7566006 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
7566007 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
7566008 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
7566009 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
7566010 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
7566011 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
7566012 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
7566013 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
7566014 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
7566015 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way
7566016 even though weve had some successes this is not the time to say the battle is over
7566017 obvious customers for medical tourism are the uninsured who have to pay the entire cost of their care
7566018 g ood foreign facilities offer many common treatments at 15 of the u s price
7566019 the attraction is obvious and not just to patients without coverage
7566020 some u s employers who cover their workers now pay for treatments abroad
7566021 this is nothing less than the globalization of medical care
7566022 economists used to say that health care was the one thing that couldnt be outsourced
7566023 it means they had better get cracking on supporting a national health care system that insures everyone and controls costs
7566024 c learly they no longer have a monopoly hold on the u s consumer
7566025 the medical interests are already lobbying their elected officials to make it harder for americans to seek medical care in other lands for the good of patient safety of course
7566026 weve already seen the drugmakers try to stop americans from getting cheaper prescriptions from canada and mexico this doesnt work when the price differentials are enormous
7566027 the wiser path is to offer american consumers a better deal and let the cost of travel give domestic providers a competitive advantage
7566028 most patients would rather have medical treatment close to home anyway
7566029 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010
7566030 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable this is a tool that can improve the conversation
7566031 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7566032 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense3 and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7566033 hospice and palliative medicine is a newly recognized medical subspecialty
7566034 this unique specialty reflects the need for specialized medical care for the growing number of older adults and persons with serious complex and chronic illnesses which currently pose an enormous challenge to the healthcare industry
7566035 there is a much greater demand than supply of physicians skilled in hospice and palliative medicine
7566036 well trained physicians in this field have unlimited opportunities aahpm is steadily expanding educational opportunities so that physicians who want to move into hospice and palliative medicine have more learning opportunities
7566037 the unipac book series helps to form a strong foundation for developing these skills
7566038 like good textbooks the unipac booklets have multiple contributors and have been peer reviewed by the leaders in the field
7566039 we want to farm live 10 minutes from downtown and have a curbside parking space in front of my office

7566047 hay chicos de 9 10 a os que se van de la casa a esa edad no tienen posibilidad de pensar en el riesgo que hay en la calle en el caso de esta ni a ella est bien pero pensemos en todo el riesgo que es cruzar una frontera el estar en lugares extra os
7566048 los chicos de esta edad deben estar en su casa estudiando no pensando en c mo tienen que hacer para subsistir
7566049 hay grandes l deres que tienen la capacidad de tomar la cinta de capit n
7566050 retirarme de esta manera tan alegre fue lo mejor m s all de haber conseguido una medalla

7566073 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7566074 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7566075 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7566076 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7566077 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7566078 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7566079 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7566080 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7566081 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7566082 the thing the leader of the sovereign nation of iraq doesnt understand is that we broke his country and it is out duty to fix it
7566083 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7566084 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7566085 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7566086 we are in discussions with some of the automotive manufacturers
7566087 right now if youre running off of a battery and a lot of times the batteries in the hybrids they weigh 275 pounds theyre six feet long theyre huge
7566088 when youre using the battery to power the car if you can take any other system that also uses the battery off of that main source then you can extend the range of the vehicle
7566089 try this first as an external product get used to how consumers would use it and their response then it would allow them to integrate it into the cellphone
7566090 weve done prototyping for a centralized power pack that would be on a vest on the back
7566091 and weve also been working on decentralized approaches so you would have individual m2e units that would be integrated into various devices like night scopes and night vision goggles and different communication devices
7566092 we are in the process of building a small scale generator that can just show how if you put this in used it in a wind turbine that you would help reduce some of the gearbox problems that they have
7566093 you would get greater efficiency which would then allow wind power and ocean wave to be more competitive with fossil fuel based power

7566108 saya melihat isu ini sengaja untuk menimbulkan unsur unsur yang bersifat sentimen perkauman maknanya kabinet bayangan yang dihadapkan itu ialah gambaran bagaimana barisan nasional cuba untuk menimbulkan rasa ketakutan di kalangan orang orang melayu bahawa jika anwar menang nanti kabinet negara kita nanti akan dikuasai kebanyakannya oleh kaum bukan melayu
7566109 itu modal lama sekarang ini masyarakat di malaysia adalah pengundi yang berasaskan kepada pengetahuan dan bukan lagi pengundi yang bersentimen dan emosional dan saya percaya ini propaganda yang dilakukan oleh bn
7566110 ini seolah olah hendak menimbulkan kemarahan orang pas supaya mereka tidak keluar mengundi dengan harapan mereka umno akan berjaya memenangi kerusi tersebut
7566111 saya percaya pengundi pas adalah pengundi yang diasuh dan dididik dengan kematangan berpolitik oleh pemimpin pemimpin kita yang tidak mudah percaya dengan sebaran sebaran murahan

7566113 i will have to close the store in the immediate future
7566114 when we started banks werent going to lend us any money we had no personal property
7566115 this building had been held up endlessly in permits we were closed for 40 days
7566116 i realized that id done a fairly decent job of reducing the stores debt and i still wasnt going to be able to come out of it fast enough
7566117 this business is successful but not with whats weighing us down
7566118 if we can erase the debt from before we could be successful
7566119 t o resolve the current situation we need to immediately raise 50 000 and an additional 25 000 throughout the coming months that will allow the bookstore to be self sustaining by the september textbook season
7566120 is the same as the idea of sending out the e mail
7566121 fifty percent of what makes a good bookstore is the owner and 50 is the people
7566122 i would never want people to throw money at me without them understanding my gratitude
7566123 these are hard times and people dont have extra money i absolutely would love to give something back
7566124 theres nothing brandeis hasnt done to extend itself and make me feel welcome
7566125 green is really tuned in to the needs of a college community
7566126 we all want to do everything we can to keep it afloat
7566127 the minute i started reading i knew that i had to help
7566128 doesnt only sell books it provides a place for students to hang out
7566129 it became a hub that offered the opportunity to learn more about brandeis and waltham
7566130 brandeis understands better than other universities that you can make business succeed while being fair to customers
7566131 its my duty as a brandeis student to support local business who help facilitate places of community and education to not only survive but thrive
7566132 brandeis is a lot more tied to the community than it even knows
7566133 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7566134 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations

7566139 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7566140 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7566141 gas prices didnt have that much of an effect on those who were determined to travel
7566142 one reason might be because of the fairly high median income in our region
7566143 why are there beings at all and not much rather nothing

7566145 lame excuses are being made by the cbi in order to shield the culprits
7566146 weve been slammed since june our company produced the sexopolis rock arena the first annual pornstar ball and our fourth of july bondage ball we are pooped out but we wanted to throw one last rager this summer as a thank you to the industry for their support
7566147 nine years in this rapidly and every changing industry is quite an achievement
7566148 an achievement that would never be able to be realized if it wasnt for the resolute support of loyal webmasters affiliates have been benefiting from up to 80 percent revshare great conversions retentions and most importantly being paid on time every time over the past 9 years
7566149 we have some of the best natural good looking males in the world in australia and want to show them off to the world for all to see
7566150 i really like you but my lawyer is being a pain in the ass and wants these terms included in the deal
7566151 failure to provide all 50 movies by april 1st will result in liquidated damages of 5 000 plus a full refund of the any money given as a deposit

7566153 one curious question how much is gos assume 8 x 8 state space larger than chess state space
7566154 for every hero that slays the dragon anothers charred to bone for every traveler that finds his path another dies alone
7566155 the job of art is to turn time into things
7566156 relish the quiet enjoy the mysteries and welcome the whole truth
7566157 the end he the artist strives for is something else than a perfectly executed print his aim is to depict dreams ideas or problems in such a way that other people can observe and consider them
7566158 the board of appeals reheard all witnesses and all were cross examined the board then decided on new sanctions
7566159 official punishments are disciplinary and residential probation until december 2008
7566160 after reading the new sanctions prof william kapelle hist chair of the appeals board stated that darwish was allowed back on campus
7566161 theres no definite answer to whether or not the outcome of his first appeal affected his second
7566162 the second appeal would no longer be able to consider the prior event
7566163 i believe the board made a fair and balanced decision
7566164 mamoons right to due process and procedural fairness were upheld during yesterdays hearing
7566165 if an appeal goes through that doesnt necessarily mean there was a problem with the process in the first place
7566166 mamoon has had a great deal of support from both his friends and the brandeis community
7566167 that kind of dedication is not seen often on this campus or anywhere else for that matter i think its a testament to how committed the students of this campus are not only to upholding due process and procedural fairness but to the universitys greater message of social justice
7566168 we will be focused on figuring out how mamoon can finish his typ year
7566169 the cost of everything suddenly became a much bigger issue
7566170 its very frustrating and aggravating to feel like youve been robbed of a certain freedom
7566171 it makes me feel like something has been taken away from me i feel like i always have to think twice about everything
7566172 we were so used to getting into the car and going places trying new things and now if we do it at all it takes more planning
7566173 i try to drive only as necessary so i can make a tank of gas stretch for two weeks you have to think about how you do food shopping and where you are taking the kids
7566174 to keep my sanity with three kids at home all summer i have to get out
7566175 youve got to do things we go to the zoo splish splash jones beach the pool
7566176 im not going to stop from doing things that i like
7566177 i probably stay home more than i used to and more than i like
7566178 but for the most part we still have fun things to do
7566179 who would take care of my kids and would i ever find a job that pays enough to pay for the child care
7566180 instantly unleash the explosive power hidden behind this well guarded secret to dominating key search engine rankings in under 7 days using this embarrassingly simple backdoor shortcut
7566181 just read below to learn how you can harness the full power
7566182 the union presented all their changes in terms of its fiscal year they said were willing to go above and beyond funding you may receive from any other source from jean from everyone
7566183 considering we want to make bigger events we came to an agreement that means we will get a guaranteed amount of money and work in the framework that we need
7566184 the union really wanted us to come back from what theyve said they really want the benchmark of having allocations of having over a million very important to them to have a benchmark of a million
7566185 they wanted us back they didnt want money being spent by a student group especially a secured organization that they had no say over
7566186 i think the most important thing is were not going back to the turning a new leaf were both groups that are meant to serve campus life we were able to come to an agreement that will only help the student body
7566187 now we can work together more on improving social life engaging students and supporting each other to put on the most innovative ideas and policies
7566188 if we have extra money left over instead of appealing to the f board to have it changed or giving it back to the union we can move it straight over
7566189 it allows us a lot more flexibility in terms of our planning
7566190 the union basically told us that they can give us money in excess a huge sum of money that we could never get from jean eddy we believe they have a lot of rollover money they have a lot of money that needs to be reallocated to have more barbeques to have more concerts to put on a huge concert
7566191 we really believe we can get an allocation of 150 000 which even under our budget under jean we would never be able to do
7566192 the maximum that student events was receiving from the administration used to be their minimum baseline amount received as a secured organization from the finance board
7566193 theyre all supportive with 150 000 budget the possibilities are very very large to us we can plan a lot bigger than we thought
7566194 i think theres two things i think the first thing was similar to what the union was saying i think student events and the student union are the two most powerful and prominent organizations on this campus if the two organizations can work with respect to each other a lot of good things can happen
7566195 done in a very friendly way it was something the groups approached each other with
7566196 we have a lot of respect for the union and the union for us and this is a reflection of that
7566197 ale cz owiek jest g upi pije a wie e rano trzeba jako wsta
7566198 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt
7566199 accredited investors with a minimum net worth of 1 million
7566200 commodity contracts intended to be used as risk management instruments
7566201 as a combinatorial prediction market with an automated market maker
7566202 the statistical meaning is hard to judge without a lot of additional data
7566203 the boy is so surprised that he writes a paper called my monkey can spell
7566204 im not surprised that other people have found issues in these results
7566205 the way we go about analyzing this data is much different than when youre dealing with modern organisms that have lots of representation in databases
7566206 in my view weve done more than we needed to do its just an argument about math on the other end
7566207 we didnt see any new looting at the eight sites which was really very very encouraging
7566208 if there was major recent looting there we would have expected to find it
7566209 but i didnt see anything that was there in late 2003 or early 2004
7566210 the shadows of a hindu past also survived in shikarpur twenty miles from ratodero the larger town to which we moved when i was four years
7566211 old shikarpur was also falling apart because of the neglect rather than war
7566212 when my brother and i pedaled through the streets of old shikarpur we occasionally looked up at the decay wrought by time across rusting banisters into broken lattice windows towards the marble memorial plaques placed by builders who imagined their works the sethi asood amal menghra jasrani building grandly constructed in a d was already falling down the botanical garden outside shikarpur reputed to have been one of the wonders of western india was turning into a wilderness of the mereweather pavilion named after a former commissioner of sind was rarely used the crocodile pool was empty and the heavy steps of domesticated elephants no longer echoed in the quiet of the late afternoon rao bahadur udhawdas tarachand and opened by sir lancelot graham governer of sind as recently as 1937 was a memorial that should have lasted at least a generation
7566213 there can be no long term peace or social stability in a country if the gap between rich and poor is too wide the same is true for the world if the gap between rich and poor nations remain wide or is even increasing lasting stability will not be attained
7566214 we already provide hundreds of thousands of users with a very powerful value proposition on fpo we believe that

7566301 i feel proud that i am leaving the brandeis world of community service on solid financial footing
7566302 my background is in social services so i used to work the other side of the fence
7566303 realized that i would still have my connections with the people in the community it seemed like just a wonderful fit
7566304 that is something that im very supportive of and very enthusiastic about
7566305 so many successes in the community its very exciting to have both the community service which is the traditional co curricular after school volunteering and this community engaged learning which is course based service that is a very exciting new aspect that has been brought to brandeis and i am certainly thrilled that it is here and hopefully it will receive more support and funding and it will continue to grow
7566306 the partnerships are truly sustainable reciprocal partnerships that really reflect the needs of the community and the community voice and i have had such wonderful relationships with community members i consider so many of them my friends
7566307 shes a great hostess shes a very good cook very welcoming

7566309 diane is an amazing leader and an inspiration to all she works endlessly for the community and her commitment to waltham and brandeis shines through in everything she does
7566310 she has taught me to be a leader to value the work i do in the community and to always look for new needs that can be met in the community
7566311 is going to be the hardest part of the position to leave i have been privileged to meet hundreds of wonderfully dedicated intelligent committed students who have kept me motivated and energetic and not allowed me to slack off in any way

7566328 he spoke to us about the health care crisis because to date only 4 out of 7 hospitals are functioning in new orleans indeed one of many problems that exist include a shortage of health care infrastructure there are fewer hospital beds and fewer doctors sparking new interest in health clinics
7566329 we had eight students from brandeis and ten from tufts willing to do work and they just werent utilizing our brainpower or our manpower
7566330 they couldnt find the right jobs for us and we were very disappointed with the jobs we were assigned we wanted to be part of something efficient and we didnt know how much of an impact we were making
7566331 common ground laid the foundation for progress but it is frustratingly slow we were there in august and it didnt look like they had made much progress since then
7566332 we realized that was our calling as a group were able to take the information we learned about the health care crisis from professors at tulane and do something about it were able to do much more than a weeks worth of community service in new orleans essentially weve become consultants helping a greater cause
7566333 basically everybody thinks its just some swamp but aside from the areas that are torn down completely some parts are really beautiful theres a lot of history a lot of culture we learned so much about the community and the culture and we were able to see that theres a lot of people helping out and that theres still a lot of racial issues down there
7566334 this was my second trip its an amazing city theres a cultural richness with the hospitality the jazz and bourbon street and on top of that we had an amazing team chemistry everybody got along right away so it was a great bonding experience
7566335 theres going to be more structure since were only working with the nofha project
7566336 we wanted something great to do and this is the best possible option now we have found something that is tangible and can take full advantage of student involvement from the ground up
7566337 i think its a bad idea for a lot of reasons
7566338 it will bring unbridled growth environmental degradation and unwanted change

7566373 ive never contested an election ever before i conceded that the elections were fair and run properly by the administration so i was able to bow out gracefully
7566374 in this one case i have never seen or been a part of such an unfair election where the other side was committing these numerous illegal activities i cant sit by and let this go by unchallenged if we really care about justice and fairness in elections i will submit this case to the uj
7566375 disqualifying candidates shuster and kaamila mohamed 11 as write ins from the primary round ballot and recognizing justin sulsky and andrew brooks as the winners of that round
7566376 hey guys the 2 ppl running for senator at large this year are the same people that i talked about in the demonstration denying my palestinian identity thats why i decided to add noam shuster as write in candidate sic
7566377 the word palestine is a very controversial term used as a euphemism for the non existence of the state of israel i just wanted their clubs name to reflect their goal
7566378 there isnt really a palestine right now but there is a palestinian people if thats the group youre aiming to help
7566379 hananiya was writing to an audience who were upset about the mamoon darwish case who were very upset because they felt they administration was targeting him because he was palestinian the fact that she said i didnt recognize her palestinian identity it was meant to damage my reputation amongst these constituents
7566380 compare this with justin sulsky and andrew brooks horrible records i know i said i wouldnt but i just cant help it authoring and being the only two senators to vote for the ridiculously partisan american flag resolution and doing absolutely nothing about almost every key progressive issue like endowment transparency and gender neutral housing at least to judge by their project reports
7566381 there have been a large number of requests for these two write in candidates to be disqualified for these two posts as chief of elections i have decided that the commission will neither mark noam and kaamila as violators of a rule nor will i disqualify them from the race
7566382 if you wish to continue using this website to comment on the election make sure that you double check the veracity of your claims further false claims considered libelous by the elections commission will be punished
7566383 the only times that the word libelous comes up in mr rutricks e mail are in reference to hypothetical future statements from the campaign if we were definitively judged to have committed libel we were never told about it and even if such a judgment was passed mr rutrick dealt with it in the way he felt was appropriate i dont see where any injunction could be made
7566384 brooks is saying that we slandered him hes saying that we said he co sponsored this resolution i would argue that it was unclear wording maybe
7566385 but in any case hes arguing that the resolution that he voted for was so despicable or detestable for us to suggest that he cosponsored it is a slander against his character so if it is a slander against his character why would he vote for it
7566386 its our opinion libel is just about fact so if we say hes wasting the unions time thats our opinion and were allowed to say that
7566387 i think it would be unethical i say that because i think it would be unethical for me to delete something that i wrote and pretend it never happened i think it would be unethical in general for people to take something back and pretend it never exists i kept it in there to use in the historical record to make sure that no one thinks i was disassembling it
7566388 there is no doubt that shuster and mohamed would not be friendly toward israel in their official capacities as members of the senate
7566389 i dont think it is hypocritical to say that as an israeli she is not very supportive of her country when she founded students for justice in palestine they were saying we want a palestinian view to go against the israeli view to counteract the violence that israelis do to palestinians
7566390 i think people at the end of the day people will say that andrew brooks is friendlier towards israel than noam is negative campaigning is allowed so long as youre telling the truth
7566391 to say that andrew brooks and justin sulsky are dinosaur reactionaries it is a statement of opinion that they are politically conservative
7566392 my ruling allows candidates to say what they think about other opponents without being punished for it i said i would be looking closely at outrageously offensive statements like dont vote for andrew because hes jewish it should be encouraged for people to tell the truth about opponents so that voters know
7566393 yeah noam schuster was going around usdan she said that
7566394 told me that supporters of noam shuster said i voted against giving the transitional year program funds for t shirts because i hate black people i hate black people so thats why i voted against giving 214 going for t shirts half of which went to typ and the other half went to t shirts for professors that taught typ students
7566395 we didnt walk around with tape recorders they couldnt have expected us to record incidents of slander that we heard from people
7566396 it says in the union constitution that the rules apply to all union members and all union organizations all union members meaning all students in the university
7566397 even the write ins have to follow all the rules that the candidates have to follow
7566398 to say that someone cant run a write in campaign because they havent met with an elections commissioner yet is why we have write in elections
7566399 my commission set the standard on libel and slander higher than past commissions have i not only allowed but encouraged candidates to speak candidly about each other to allow them to campaign negatively if they wished
7566400 i think that being able to say that the other candidate is lazy to use an example is perfectly okay and i think thats something that people need to hear an election that doesnt allow you to say that someone is lazy is a bad election
7566401 its partly true i particularly noticed that elections were flawed when something i considered flawed happened to me when i was punished for something that i wasnt able to argue every candidate should know when they were doing something wrong and had the chance to undo it and i dont consider that to be particularly groundbreaking but its just what i think is fair
7566402 i think one warning over seven different counts of libel and slander isnt enough he does not have discretion to not take action he only has discretion as to what to administer
7566403 rutrick said he personally wouldnt give people warnings because he got a red line on his campaign when he committed libel against jordan rothman the fact that that wasnt done when seven libelous comments were made when nothing was done was to remedy that ive heard of three strike laws not seven strike laws

7566756 because the boat is now traveling off track and is 1 111km from indonesia or 852km from taiwan we have deduced that it is quite possible the boat has been hijacked
7566757 we have also radioed all taiwanese fishing boats in close proximity to help locate taiyishiang
7566758 a fishing trip usually takes several months with routine work and the pressure of not catching fish everybody has mood swings but because of cultural differences and the language barrier conflicts occur each year in the past few years a few boats would be hijacked and the taiwanese captain killed or robbed
7566759 fishing is hard work all experienced captains tell their sons to go to school and get office jobs instead whats more with the recent increase in oil prices and the stagnant fish prices most fishermen now hire foreign help to lower costs
7566760 while they may not cause less trouble with the same language we would at least get along better
7566761 the vms says that the boat is approaching the philippines not indonesia
7566762 when you are trying to save a life time is precious it is ridiculous to try to send a boat from taiwan asking other fishing boats is also not an option the abductors could be armed so the best way is to ask the philippine government to save lee by sending send sea patrols

7566775 uni radio is a grassroots radio station were deeply entrenched in our community here in hsinchu the radio reception spans three counties hsinchu taoyuan and miaoli our programming evolves around lohas lifestyles of health and sustainability and covers food fashion living and transportation
7566776 we are trying to create a friendly and homey environment for our guests
7566777 i am waiting for a decision i fit all the criteria
7566778 i believe the government should compensate me for taking away my liberty for six years which also meant i lost the childhood of my daughters
7566779 it became a hub that offered the opportunity to learn more about brandeis and waltham
7566780 im putting me together a special team and i need me eight jewish american soldiers as a bushwackin guerrilla army were gonna be doing one thing and one thing only killin nazis we will be cruel to the germans and through our cruelty they will know who we are
7566781 it is offered to all the united methodist churches not necessarily for shoes but we knew that was a need
7566782 bluestem grade school has a brand new gym and they like all their students to have a pair of shoes dedicated specifically for the gym
7566783 this is the first year weve done this and were providing shoes for several kids
7566784 were holding the reception to let kids know theyre special
7566785 last week we fed teachers and staff during in service simply because the cafeteria wasnt open at the school yet
7566786 we get a lot of compliments that wow this is the real deal
7566787 the wildlife rehabilitation center has been in service since 1983 and we had individuals from kansas and federal wildlife divisions come to their inspections yesterday
7566788 the department of wildlife and parks used to come in and supervise these guys and help them out
7566789 it has deteriorated something terrible its not being done right and the animals are suffering
7566790 they found it was clean and no animals were mistreated
7566791 we did not have anyone at that facility that met that standard
7566792 the bottom line was yesterday was the was the first time we had been notified we had any issues that rose to removing animals from the center
7566793 our goal now is to do what we need to do
7566794 the facility now is no longer being able to accept anything
7566795 it depends on whether or not they have any follow up response
7566796 ever since the incident it seems like this type of crime is increasing
7566797 you would not be in the wrong to expect that kind of announcement
7566798 theres no doubt this is vinnys team and were going to recognize that officially
7566799 were fairly tight were on a type of revenue stream which is problematic were in preliminary discussions now were going to try and keep it all county and do a county wide mill levy reduction for advancing the communication project
7566800 what we had was an unfair tax that would create hot and cold spots within the state to buy big ticket items
7566801 if that business goes dark your community will lose over 1 million in local payroll
7566802 this sales tax would create an uneven playing field and im not sure i can deal with it
7566803 those are all questions weve got to answer ourselves and were trying to get more input before we go forward
7566804 when they had the arena tax on there i didnt see people flocking to butler county to buy goods because they could save a buck
7566805 i think the most important thing to realize is were not going to take action unless wichita does something
7566806 the state gives the money out its not us who gets the sales tax money to distribute back to the city
7566807 much of its army up to the area of tskhinvali the capital of its pro russian south ossetian province
7566808 undeterred ordered troops to take tskhinvali the ossetian capital and to knock out the bridge
7566809 russia will feel entitled to do the same with south ossetia and georgias other breakaway enclave abkhazia
7566810 over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
7566811 its clear the policies we have pursued regarding missile defense and installations in europe and regarding further expansion of nato have created difficulties with russia it takes two to tango
7566812 but is the us delivering a message in a bottle
7566813 dont like saber rattling that could bring us back to the scary days of the cold war
7566814 i am appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault to contact police it was a busy time of the evening and there were many young people in the area i am sure many of them would have seen what happened
7566815 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is indeed tragic our thoughts are with his family
7566816 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad

7566821 your story that the cape coastline would disappear in 25 years would cause alarm and despondency here in cape town but for two things firstly the writer is better known for his political satire and secondly the study appears to have been written with the help of the south african weather bureau notorious for giving the wrong weather forecasts for the cape is this perhaps the trial run for next years april fools day
7566822 i believe that global warming is the biggest scientific scam ever there is no evidence to prove that the current climate variations are not a natural cycle
7566823 in my zeal to rekindle idealism i made some mistakes
7566824 it all began right here in waltham 200 years ago when charles cabot lowell and james moody invented for the first time a way of putting cloth together in one place
7566825 when that industrial revolution began there were 280 parts per million of co2 up in the atmosphere 200 years later there are 380 parts per million up in the atmosphere
7566826 lakes are being formed because its so warm up in greenland the water is now so warm that over the course of the summer they create crevices that burrow all the way down the ice
7566827 most of the co2 is red white and blue were the ones putting it up there along with the europeans
7566828 poor countries all around the world that dont have the capacity to adapt to that kind of dramatic change
7566829 the only reason theyre not changing is because they dont think they have to
7566830 you have to change the way in which people think about the issues so that an investment is not a deficit but something you gain back
7566831 theres a new energy revolution a green revolution a green industrial revolution thats going to be what the 21st century is known for
7566832 this is your generations great opportunity to have the defining moment when you have the answerable courage to use your skills to make a difference
7566833 congressman markeys address was definitely inspiring its exciting and reassuring to know that there are representatives in the government who strongly advocate for confronting the issue of climate change and especially emphasize the need for investment in alternative energy sources
7566834 while i respect ed markey i was very shocked when he bragged about behind a force behind the 1996 telecommunications act the 1996 telco act decreased competition increased consolidation of media outlets and was at its core a raid on government coffers by a few big telco companies im very upset that markey is proud of this egregious example of corporate welfare

7566844 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7566845 if you have something of economic value theres always some way to realize that value
7566846 wall street firms make a living coming up with structures or processes if we had a need or a desire to instantly raise cash or capital there are things we can do
7566847 even without the restriction the value of the stock might save one or two bad quarters but doesnt provide long term financial flexibility
7566848 procrastination is like masturbation it may sound like a good idea at the time but in the end youre only fucking yourself

7566986 you deceived the taiwanese for half a century about being anti communist and recovering the mainland doing great harm both to the country and the public
7566987 you killed innumerable people and took not a few hundred million but hundreds of billions of nt dollars so you have no right to accuse others
7566988 the elan ii and iie differ in one primary area the elan iie has canons unique eye level focus technology originally introduced with the a2e although it has been vastly improved over the first generation system found on the a2d
7566989 while the elan ii shares the same name and many of its features with the original elan it doesnt share much in the way it looks
7566990 the single item that set the original elan apart from other cameras regardless of make or model was its belt driven whisper drive motor drive system
7566991 the elan iis three point autofocusing system retains the one shot af and ai servo modes found on the original plus it has an additional mode called ai focus that works as a combination of the two
7566992 the same five exposure modes and four pic modes found on the elan are also available on the elan ii and are accessed by the raised
7566993 the non zooming built in flash gn43 iso 100 covers focal lengths down to 28mm
7566994 the number of custom functions has been expanded from seven to eleven on the elan ii while the bar code reader has been dropped a built in wireless remote control has been added note wireless remote is optional and is not included in this auction the ii will accept the accessory bp 50 battery pack which not only replaces the lithium battery with much more common aa size batteries but which also has an additional on off switch and a shutter release positioned for vertical shooting all other features of the original elan are applicable to the ii as well
7566995 the elan iie is also the beneficiary of an updated eye controlled focusing system first available on the a2e the focusing response time has been much improved plus it operates in both the horizontal and vertical positions additionally the iies eye controlled focus system is linked directly to the cameras servo af mode and depth of field indicator and operates in concert with the aim system calibration of the eye controlled focus system is much simpler with the elan iie as well the user sets the command dial thats the one on the photographers left

7566997 the biggest card that russia holds is its energy resources
7566998 but there is a lot of mutual dependence here russia cant use these in a big way against opponents if russia stopped delivering oil and gas to europe it would cut off a major portion of its own national revenue
7566999 people are willing to share the anti western rhetoric from the authorities as long as they are not asked to make big economic sacrifices for it
7567000 the energy card is clearly a big one to play
7567001 its a hell of a lot easier to sit in a warm house in khabarovsk and watch the national treasury drop by billions than it is to sit in a cold house in france or germany
7567002 one of the main upshots of recent events is that moscow is expected to pursue its global energy objectives with greater vigor
7567003 thats not what the west wanted but thats what the world will get
7567004 what are the problems faced and can they be treated with testosterone thats where the question lies

7567010 once we got the first goal there was only one winner there were a lot of positives today
7567011 its always better to win through collective effort and it shows that we are not relying on any individual
7567012 there are two more matches to go and we will play to win
7567013 i dont think we deserved to win we made too many mistakes with the bat
7567014 we knew we had to negotiate the first 15 overs but we lost four quick wickets and it was an uphill task from there

7567022 our athletes worked hard but competing players worked even harder and their basic training was very solid
7567023 the level of competition was so much higher than before and this was seen in the number of records that were broken

7567099 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o de mayor importancia es el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos porque estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejarlo escapar despu s de lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto

7567124 so when cities are talking big money for example right now in fredrick md theyre talking about a 300 million dollar incinerator i can talk 300 million dollars too and we can talk about getting 90 percent of your resources out of the incinerators
7567125 to feed incinerators and landfills the world must keep using a single mixed waste trash can
7567126 the key to making zero waste profitable is that people are required to sort their waste three ways recycling composting and trash in any community thats decided to sort discards into three bins san francisco nova scotia toronto and others they will never go back it is so profitable to take the zero waste path

7567182 when the pace started to slow i felt incredible and should have gone in front
7567183 thats something i need to work on when youre in a race with six or seven of the fastest guys in the world you dont wait
7567184 the race went as well as i could have hoped given the rainy conditions and the fact that this was my third 50 kilometer race of the year
7567185 i came in hoping to walk under four hours 10 minutes and i walked 4 08
7567186 i finished 39th today against the best walkers in the world i wasnt the best but i was among the best
7567187 we still have a month until the hoosier job fair in clinton county and we have already received great community support a number of businesses signed up to participate in this event right after senator boots senator hershman and i announced the job fair
7567188 it is encouraging to me that there are already 1 300 jobs being offered this hoosier job fair will serve as a great service to the people of indiana i greatly encourage anyone who is looking for employment or new opportunities to attend this event because it will be a great opportunity for hoosier job seekers
7567189 this will be the 8 th hoosier job fair that i have hosted in the seven previous job fairs over 12 000 jobs have been offered to hoosiers looking for employment or new opportunities i greatly expect this job fair will be as successful as my previous seven
7567190 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that would consider coming back
7567191 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox
7567192 but if the giants really want him they have a shot
7567193 this is a falsehood we certainly havent contracted for any phone mail or in person solicitation
7567194 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7567195 one of the womens names was maybe fadhila and the other was called widad
7567196 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7567197 i did not disconnect it because maybe it fell off me
7567198 i honestly couldnt care less who scarlett johansson is supporting or that she wants to marry barack obama i mean get over yourself and show me your boobs period
7567199 its totally irrelevant what angelina jolie says about who shes voting for isnt going to affect anyone and that very irrelevancy proves that celebrities are just celebrities nothing more and that no one cares what they think even though their narcissism might have them believing otherwise
7567200 how can you live the life you lead a life of enormous riches when whoevers in power isnt going to affect you in any way oprah is not dealing with the sub prime crisis
7567201 its not such an impossible amount of work for me to meet some kids take some pictures to make them happy

7567204 we all expected inflation to quicken after the government raised fuel prices but its not as bad as we thought
7567205 its a good sign for the vietnamese economy because a lot of investors thought the cpi for august was going to be 3 percent
7567206 la verdad es que estamos preocupados por la situaci n el empate podr a no ser tan malo porque lo conseguimos de visitante pero cuando tienes una ventaja de dos goles es frustrante que te alcancen
7567207 transport stocks gained on expectations that the sector will benefit from falling fuel costs to boost their bottom lines
7567208 thats why the tourism sector attracted much market attention today
7567209 concerns over a us economic slowdown remain in place few can be sure whether us markets are able to get away from turbulence ahead
7567210 the local bourse has not turned technically stable yet despite todays gains it is possible for it to test 6 800 points again if wall street suffers volatility
7567211 if the government pushes forward with its mega projects including infrastructure construction as well as creating confidence among investors our gdp in the last six months of this year is most likely to be no less than 5 2 percent
7567212 therefore we expect only one more 25 basis point hike from the bank of thailand and this should be the last rate hike for the rest of this year
7567213 it aims to spread the culture of reducing greenhouse gases and promote a shift in consuming patterns to energy efficient and less carbon emitting products
7567214 what do these pairings teach about what shakespeare and his audience viewed as an appropriate match
7567215 im trying to get the name of a cartoon from the late 50s or early 60s it had two characters who at least in my memory remind me of penn and teller the one character was tall and bombastic the other was shorter and never spoke although he would whisper to the other character i believe the smaller character was named leonardo but i wouldnt swear to it
7567216 but we cant it wont work no matter whats between us

7567223 it is possible an agreement will be reached in the next two weeks
7567224 danmarks nationalbank and the financial sector in denmark have entered into an agreement with the board of directors of roskilde bank a s via a new bank on buying all assets and taking over all debt and other liabilities except from hybrid core capital and subordinated loan capital in roskilde bank a s
7567225 the auditing of roskilde banks interim report has revealed additional losses in the bank to the extent that roskilde bank does not meet solvency requirements
7567226 the takeover of roskilde bank follows the fact that no offers domestic or foreign were received after a thorough sales process on either all or parts of roskilde bank
7567227 it is expected that the takeover of roskilde bank will contribute to limiting the negative effect on the danish financial system
7567228 were also eliminating heavy magazines and opting for lightweight reading instead
7567229 these new efficient aircraft are going to help us get through this crisis
7567230 were asking our passengers to pay more so we dont want to give them less we need them to fly cathay pacific and keep coming back
7567231 our planes are flying with half or less than half filled water tanks as it lightens the load and reduces fuel consumption and we are not the only airline doing this

7567233 the number of departures suggests that its gone beyond a company specific issue and is now a symptom of the broader global crisis thats impacting companies bottom lines across the board
7567234 the last time we had so many departures was around 2001 following the technology boom
7567235 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come
7567236 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit earnings per share growth in the long term
7567237 its clearly been difficult for people in the funds management space because the markets have been so tough
7567238 there may be some sort of generational change happening here
7567239 well i had my first pair of decks when i was 15 or i was into hip hop and got my first pair of technics on my 18th birthday i was a breakdancer and i did graffiti when i was going shopping in birmingham buying my hip hop stuff these new records were how i got into house music
7567240 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music
7567241 we are studying that possibility and i think the anti terrorism council and other agencies under this are studying that
7567242 tagging them as a terrorist group involves a very meticulous and tedious process which lies on the basis of identifiable evidence which would identify the specific participation of individuals thats a very specific process and well cross that bridge when we get there
7567243 remove this peace process we dont have a relationship with the government
7567244 as a republic will we be cowed by threats from the milf which does not have credibility i think the answer to that is obvious
7567245 we are still hopeful that some sensibility resides in certain members of the milf to really breakaway from the stranglehold which those in their organization have apparently because of their public pronouncements which prevents reasonable people within that organization from coming out
7567246 i still do not want to stereotype each and every person of the milf as a coddler of atrocities there is still some hope however be that as it may our unbargainable condition is that we will run after the perpetrators of the atrocities and we will prevent a recurrence of these atrocities
7567247 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7567248 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7567249 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7567250 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7567251 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7567252 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility

7567255 it is simply shocking that only 33 or less of americans reports having a great deal or quite a lot of trust in 11 of 15 industries measured in the survey
7567256 in these three communications the president expressed his concern at the latest developments in the doha round
7567257 he called on these leaders not to give up and to push for discussions to begin again the president hopes in september the president is very concerned about this issue because if discussions fail the effects on the world economy and developing nations for indonesia will be bad
7567258 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
7567259 hi how is everybody doing today i am tommy and this is sheri
7567260 we have got about 12 to 14 properties we are going to see today we are going to try to keep moving very quickly
7567261 i had no idea that in such a nice location i could get a house for a price that is half of what it was just three years back
7567262 a lot of these foreclosures dont even have signs up saying that they are foreclosures and they are gone in a day
7567263 so its difficult to find them and when we do its hard to work with the banks to get our contracts approved so we decided that if it was that hard for us to do how hard it was for everybody else to do it
7567264 they make it very organized and its kind of fun you know to go on the buses to see all the properties
7567265 it does save me a lot of time instead of actually contacting all the agents to go through these properties
7567266 if you put it into a light where you look at this house and you say somebody used to live there and they lost their home and they lost everything its really hard
7567267 but we want to make it an enjoyable experience and fun and a great opportunity for new people to have a home themselves that maybe couldnt afford a home three years ago
7567268 yes there is a sad story involved if you are to see a foreclosed house but if you really look at it from an investment perspective you know its like any other business
7567269 w hen it came to taiwanese i wasnt quite as good my older brother jared hes the only american in taiwan to my knowledge who can speak taiwanese as well as the local people
7567270 i spent most my life growing up in kaohsiung where taiwanese is basically the local language in addition of course to mandarin
7567271 especially during childhood when you are a kid you learn fast but when it came to taiwanese i wasnt quite as good my older brother jared who really picked it up fast and naturally much faster than i did hes the only american in taiwan to my knowledge who can speak taiwanese as well as the local people
7567272 i remember one time when jared was talking to some friends in taiwanese while walking into a convenience store and a local taxi driver overheard my brother speaking fluent taiwanese
7567273 ah pao was the spark who turned me into a more or less fluent taiwanese speaker
7567274 in the beginning of the show i had to learn and memorize my lines in taiwanese and it was not easy at first but after three months of training by ah pao i did it
7567275 it was chen idea and he played an important role in putting things together during the beginning stages of netv and at the same time he was trying to think of a good way to promote the hoklo language on television his idea was that if viewers could see foreigners speaking fluent hoklo this might encourage local people here to better appreciate the language and might even help some taiwanese to want to brush up on their own hoklo skills and at the same time of course it would be a wonderful way to help people learn english as well
7567276 david who is called ya da wei on our show has been in taiwan for over 25 years and he speaks taiwanese like a pro
7567277 the studio started out in the basement of an old unused church building but now we have a new studio which is the headquarters for netv
7567278 in the beginning when we first started making the show we worked from 8am to as late as midnight sometimes completing in one day at most maybe just two 30 minute shows but as things progressed we can now make two or three a day in an 11 hour shift
7567279 in the end though the final result is a very well made cable show and its gaining popularity with both locals and expats around the island
7567280 weve already shot two shows but we have another 11 to go before the station can begin to air it as a series
7567281 it will allow taiwanese viewers to see how a foreigner like me travels plays and mingles with the local people here and were having fun filming it
7567282 according to the latest information 65 people were killed 22 were hospitalized with various injuries and three returned home after receiving medical help
7567283 the remaining foreigners on board the boeing died their names are being checked as several corpses were received at the morgue without documentation
7567284 suddenly there was a fire and lots of smoke my eyes were sore it became very hard to breathe
7567285 then i saw another iranian escape by the planes rear door i ran and fell to the ground
7567286 we screamed for help luckily my two sisters also survived
7567287 everywhere around the site there were body parts of the unfortunate passengers you could hear screams and moans there was a horrible stench of burning bodies
7567288 our three telephones were ringing incessantly people were crying could not speak yelled at us demanding to know how we allowed such a tragedy there were children there young athletes and their parents grief was overwhelming
7567289 people were kissing what remained of their loved ones even we who should be used to anything could not look at this and turned away not to begin crying too
7567290 we cant sit out on our deck and see pikes peak anymore and its illegal too
7567291 they kept telling me i needed a 250 variance for this and a variance for that they started sending me on a bureaucratic goose chase finally i gave up and started building

7567297 ill try chemo for six months but if it gets too uncomfortable and inconvenient
7567298 having lived 80 years ive done a lot i dont have reason to think ive been badly treated by life
7567299 had a trend toward increased chemotherapy during their last three months of life and had increased overall aggressiveness of care but did not have improvement in survival
7567300 our findings suggest that in the presence of rapidly progressive disease aggressive care measures like new chemotherapy regimens within the last month of life and the administration of chemotherapy within the last two weeks of life are not associated with a survival benefit
7567301 palliative chemotherapy which is what most oncologists do is meant to shrink cancer and improve the quality and quantity of life for as long as possible without making patients too sick in the bargain
7567302 there is a difference between palliative chemotherapy administered early in the trajectory of disease and near the end of life
7567303 the goal of end of life care should be to avoid interventions such as cytotoxic chemotherapy that are likely to decrease the quality of life while failing to increase survival
7567304 have a huge price tag of up to us 100 000 a patient per year
7567305 it is time to think long and hard about continuing treatment
7567306 its time to have an extensive discussion with patients about their goals and the risks and benefits of chemotherapy
7567307 put everything in writing heres what you have what we can do for it what will happen with treatment and without it so that everyone is on the same page
7567308 what is your understanding of your illness what would you like to do with the time remaining

7567312 my goal is that we become recognized as a group that sets high standards but also looks for ways to enhance a students ability to achieve those high standards
7567313 the pressure from people outside the arena on student athletes to win or be no 1 often makes it very difficult for them to be true students
7567314 its not clear what the student athlete should be we keep defining it and redefining it but i dont think weve come to grips with that which makes this cabinets job quite difficult
7567315 we are disappointed that fay disrupted the divisions first national television broadcast this year but we are happy that the game was played and that everyone appears to be safe

7567321 if we allow our doctrine of election to become merely a secret calculus that determines who gets saved and who does not we have lost touch with the original biblical intention gods calling and election of abraham was not merely so that he should be saved and become the spiritual father of those who will finally be among the redeemed in the new creation the elect in another sense it was rather and more explicitly that he and his people should be the instrument through whom god would gather that multinational multitude that no man or woman can number election is of course in the light of the whole bible election unto salvation but is first of all election into mission

7567331 it wont have all the capabilities theres more than a couple of months of work left but we are targeting 3 1
7567332 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7567333 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs

7567384 allah almighty says my love is mandatory for those who love one another in me and sit together for my sake and who visit one another for my sake and who give generously to to one another for my sake
7567385 allah has no need for the hunger and the thirst of the person who does not restrain from telling lies and acting on them even while observing the fast
7567386 when one of you is fasting he should abstain from indecent acts and unnecessary talk and if someone begins an obscene conversation or tries to pick an argument he should simply tell him i am fasting

7567431 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7567432 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting
7567433 joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset
7567434 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7567474 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on
7567475 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation

7567491 the mccain campaign claims that obama voted to raise income taxes on individuals who earn as little as 32 000 per year thats wrong the resolution obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than 41 500 per year in total income or any couple making less than 83 000 the 32 000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making 41 500 per year after all deductions and exclusions obamas vote for a non binding budget bill does not change the fact that his own tax plan would provide a tax cut of 502 for a non married taxpayer earning 35 000

7567510 several theological lines converge and meet in unam sanctam the mystical conception of the celestial and ecclesiastical hierarchies deriving from the writings of pseudo denys the areopagyte and significantly altered in the middle ages it was in favor with the franciscan school especially st bonaventure as the orthodox franciscans reacting against the heterodoxy of the spirituals were staunch promoters of papal supremacy the expression of this supremacy in terms of the hierarchy of creation came as it were naturally although this implied in fact a gross distortion of what denys had meant by hierarchy
7567511 in the same line the exegesis of scriptural passages is highly spiritual not to say allegorical this was a common method of illustrating theological or canonical positions
7567512 in this context the expression is taken in three different senses designates papal authority in its universality extensively but not essentially different from episcopal authority v gr huguccio it designates papal authority as essentially different from episcopal authority innocent iii but within the ecclesiastical order it designates papal authority as supreme even outside of the ecclesiastical order i e the popes power over kings and emperors and his right to interfere in the temporal order innocent iv 1243 1254 claiming the right to dispose of all benefices in france a point which was not admitted by st louis ix 1226 1270 in its extreme form plenitudo potestatis is identified by some canonists with gods own power over creation it is limited only by the christian faith which the pope has no right to change v gr durand de mende bernard of parma d 1266 innocent iv
7567513 the theology of the two powers by which the middle ages tried to regulate the relations of pope and emperor since the ninth century hincmar of reims nicholas i 858 867 john viii 872 882 the bishops and popes faced with the degradation of the carolingian monarchy in france and lotharingia had upheld the principle that a king who turns bad loses thereby his legitimacy as a necessary consequence the spiritual authority was judge of the kings exercise of his function and by extension of the capacities of a claimant to the throne the ceremonies of the coronation were widely interpreted in this sense in the thirteenth century itself the emperors reversed the meaning of the principle in order to safeguard the harmony of the two powers the emperor shares both he is priest and king he must judge the pope in case the pope turns bad whence the conflict between frederic ii and innocent iv both using the same theoretical conception but putting the onus on preserving the harmony of the christianorum the former on the emperor the latter on the pope
7567514 the history of the two centuries that followed the publication of unam sanctam shows clearly that this bull was not received by all theologians and canonists of the times as binding on the christian faith it goes without saying that in any case one cannot speak of infallibility at that period the first use of the term infallible as applied to the pope appears in 1320 in the works of agostino trionfo lxiii 1 ad 1 in the language of that period one can speak of plenitudo potestatis this however was not universally accepted in the sense of unam sanctam where it entails hierocracy and implies the popes authority over princes
7567515 the violent reaction of king philip had political and mercenary more than theological motives yet the subsequent policy of the king who managed to have a french pope clement v 1305 1314 elected in 1305 and to move his living quarters to avignon cannot be dismissed as purely political it corresponded to another view of the relationship between the two powers this was implicitly recognized by clement v on february 1 1306 his brief meruit considerably toned down bonifaces doctrine concerning the subordination of temporal authority to the pope
7567516 in his account congar depicts the theologians of the fourteenth century as divided along four lines 1 the hierocrats besides matthew daquasparta and egidius romanus jacques de viterbe d 1307 barth lemy de lucques d 1327 agostino trionfo d 1328 de duplici potestate praelatorum et laicorum de planctu ecclesiae guido terreni d 1342 questio de magisterio infallibili henri trotting de oyta d 1397 determinatio compendiosa 1342 these with minor differences considered the pope to be the head of the mystical body wielding authority over all men and all things
7567517 2 others recognize the autonomy of the temporal order in the line of the theology of thomas aquinas jean quidort of paris d 1302 pierre de la palu d 1342 de potestate papae this thomist position subordinates the temporal to the spiritual in the order of final causality not as for the hierocrats in the order of efficient causality
7567518 3 some assert the autonomy of the temporal order without qualification the ghibeline party in italian politics dante 1265 1321 de monarchia and in a more extreme form marsiglio de padua d 1342 defensor pacis several statements from the defensor pacis were condemned by john xxii on october 27 1327 ds 941 946 dialogus adversus haereticos in his conflict with john xxii over the franciscan idea of christian perfection defines papal authority as purely spiritual he admits a primacy in the church even a plenitudo potestatis over temporal matters but only if temporal authority fails to function he also admits that a general council may be called without a pope when this is necessary for the good of the church
7567519 this division of opinion on the questions which boniface viii tried to settle in his bull unam sanctam become sharper with time the conflict between conciliarists and papalists was yet to come the fifth session of the council of constance april 1415 was to define an ecclesiology at odds with that of boniface viii
7567520 until the end of the middle ages the churchs formal doctrines were still determined by their reception by the body of the church although never clearly formulated in theology this principle had been affirmed by hincmar de reims in the ninth century it was accepted by the canonists who like huguccio or hostiensis henri de s guse d 1271 assimilated the church to a medieval corporation it persisted into the fifteenth century with cardinal zarabella d 1417 and panormitanus nicholas de tudeschis d 1445 and was predominant among the theologians of the council of constance
7567521 some theologians distinguish between the conclusion of the bull ds n875 to which they ascribe permanent value and the preliminaries which they regard as too time conditioned to be authoritative thus cardinal journet or the author of the remark in ds p279 the final sentence alone is the dogmatic definition in line with this the last section of unam sanctam was the only one mentioned by the eleventh session of the fifth lateran council bull pastor aeternus condemning the pragmatic sanction of bourges 1438 a decree in 23 articles with a conciliarist orientation signed by the king of france charles vii and accepted by the sorbonne the lateran council explicitly stated that it also stood by the declaration of meruit of clement v congar who mentions this distinction between the body of the text and its conclusion does not endorse it clearly
7567522 fr chenu identifies the permanent value of unam sanctam as the dogmatic teaching that all political action falls under the light and within the scope of grace he adds no doubt the arguments of this document are steeped in an unacceptable theocratism but this resulted from a theology that is outmoded today and it does not nullify the truth that was enunciated such an interpretation severs the message from the medium a procedure which as will be explained below i cannot accept the bull then becomes an allegorical document expressing a truth in terms that are no longer acceptable theocratism chenu effectively discerns the popes motivation this however does not adequately account for the formulation of his doctrine
7567523 second this relates to the question of theological method either the conclusion need not follow upon the premises in that case it must be somehow protected from error by a sudden charism but at the cost of the intelligibility of the discourse of which it is a part it would then be theologically legitimate although rationally absurd to elaborate the arguments after reaching the conclusion and these arguments need not be logically cogent as long as they are apologetically effective o r theological language must follow the rule of all language i e effectively reflect the ongoing effort of the mind searching for intelligibility in this case the conclusion will flow from the premises and preliminaries as stated in the discourse
7567524 fourth one may express this in more familiar terms boniface did not state the conclusion of the bull by itself but as explained in the context of the bull in this context the conclusion refers to the popes authority over every human creature insofar as this human creature wields or is subject to temporal authority the conclusion reflects the same theology as the complete bull its meaning is restricted and its validity qualified by the theology of temporal and spiritual power which the bull embodies
7567525 fifth it if is advisable to speak in terms of infallibility we should not say that infallibility protects one sentence from error while the rest of the discourse may well be erroneous rather the whole discourse conveys or does not convey a truth
7567526 it is not a fruitful exercise to try to abstract a core of permanent truth from such a culturally dated and politically limited document as unam sanctam that such a core of permanent truth may be arrived at i would not deny but this core is not evident from what the text itself says we may reach it by making educated guesses as to what can may or ought to have been at the back of boniface viiis mind this result is so dependent on our knowledge of the historical social and psychological conditions in which boniface viii lived and worked that if it properly belongs within the field of scholarly investigation it cannot be claimed as a norm for the faith of catholics who are utterly remote from those conditions
7567527 the distinction of john xxiii between the substance and the formulation of the faith raises a major question here for the substance of speech is never given without a formulation and furthermore in the analysis of language that i would accept no two formulations ever cover exactly the same substance if substance is the meaning the formulation is itself a syntactic combination of themes without which no meaning is available accordingly the suggested contrast between substance and formulation is misleading it tends to raise a barrier between the substance or ideal content of doctrine and its formulation as though the substance of doctrine could stand by itself in a platonic world of essences
7567528 the individual doctrines that the catechism affirms have no other authority than that which they already possess wrote cardinal joseph ratzinger in the catechism of the catholic church and the optimism of the redeemed

7567563 we will communicate to usda that congress did not include any requirement to change the criteria for meeting the definition of actively engaged in farming other than those necessary to implement the spouse eligibility provisions
7567564 we believe it is extremely important that usda be aware of this in spite of senators grassley and dorgans arguments to the contrary
7567565 usda will have to develop entirely new tests for adjusted gross farm income and adjusted gross non farm income
7567566 unlike the current adjusted gross income test which can be verified using a tax return if necessary the new tests will require usda to develop definitions and procedures to calculate farm and non farm income
7567567 the council has established a working group of top cpas to assist us in developing recommendations and were also working with some outstanding law firms with expertise in this area we have also included representatives from rice and peanut groups in the income testing working group
7567568 we will continue to be actively involved in the process of developing a reasonable and equitable procedure to apply the new income tests since the consequence of failing the tests are so severe
7567569 very few of us were satisfied with the farm payment reform that was finally agreed to in the farm bill so this is an opportunity for the bush administration that youd think theyd be crying for to leave its mark in this area

7567573 each year 15 20 people die and countless others are hospitalized in the u s as a result of consuming fresh produce contaminated with food borne pathogens such as e coli
7567574 everyone involved with produce from the field to the plate must use the best agricultural and food preparation practices
7567575 electron beam irradiation or ebeam is an emerging technology that offers the potential to significantly enhance the level of safety of complex food items such as fruits and vegetables

7567578 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
7567579 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7567580 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7567581 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7567582 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
7567583 i had a different role when i made my debut i was batting at a different slot we had a person who would carry on an innings and be there till the end i was among those batsmen who will go out and look to accelerate even if i get out it was okay
7567584 theres been a transformation in my career i am playing for the last four years and during the latter half of my career i was under a bit of pressure to take up the responsibility and play through the innings
7567585 the crowd is very colourful here so it becomes difficult to spot the ball
7567586 till the ball is new you can see it but once it gets mingled up with dirt and all that it becomes very difficult to spot it and at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough but you cannot really do anything about it

7567597 this is the first time ive actually put diamonds on a piece of athletic equipment
7567598 however we came up with a special process to affix it to the racquet with a special technology to transfer the letters to a new racquet when asia wears out the first one the same diamonds can be added to a golf club and makes a very exclusive gift for any exceptional athlete in most any sport

7567654 ive worked for spanish television for around 25 years usually riding motorcycles with cameramen sitting behind me covering the action
7567655 i worked at the olympics in sydney in 2000 athens in 2004 and now beijing in 2008 i ride the motorcycles that are used for filming the marathon triathlon and cycling events 11 events in total in beijing i have been part of a team including chinese belgian french and spanish people and we all work together to provide the television footage that will be broadcast worldwide its a fantastic experience but its very hard work on days where there is a race to cover i normally work for around 12 hours but even on the days off we test the equipment and do practice runs
7567656 although the bmw k 1100 lt is not the newest model it is one of the most suited to the task in hand
7567657 there arent too many modifications to the bike apart from all the cables that are needed to transmit the pictures the main thing to remember is that the bike is much heavier than standard because of all the equipment so to avoid the unlikely problem of overheating a second fan has been installed
7567658 my normal day to day job is managing a team of motorcycles for the cycling tour of spain
7567659 ive also ridden for the tour de france and giro ditalia cycling is the most interesting sport to cover as the speed that the guys achieve on two wheels without an engine is amazing the challenge is to position the motorcycle in the areas where the action is and capture the essence of the sport without getting in the way of any of the competitors
7567660 people who visit china tend to stay around the east coast visiting places like beijing and shanghai
7567661 very few people consider broadening their horizons and getting off the beaten track and because the country is so vast there are so many surprises to be seen the gobi desert for example is simply breathtaking there is some fantastic motorcycling to be enjoyed
7567662 it is important to get away from a manichean view of the world in black and white where peoples and countries can only be allies or enemies

7567690 in some cases the most important thing a leader can do is to pick a side and stick to it
7567691 imagine what would happen in the u s if none of us knew which side of the road to drive on
7567692 you dont want the president saying one day everyone drive on the right and the next day everyone drive on the left
7567693 if we stay we risk building resentment against the u s if we go we risk iraqi security
7567694 this might incur both risks since it makes iraqis think we are an arbitrary occupier and it makes terrorists think we could be persuaded to leave under pressure
7567695 in other words either coordinated outcome stay or go is better than the uncoordinated one maybe well stay maybe well go
7567696 if the facts change or if situations change then a legitimate public official or a policy analyst or a citizen voting for a candidate would want to know that
7567697 if a situation has changed maybe its a good thing that the opinions have changed
7567698 voters would like to think that their elected officials are being honest
7567699 but i think most voters understand that elected officials have a legitimate reason to want to change their views on issues in a world thats constantly changing and in a political system where in order to get things done you have to sometimes compromise
7567700 thats different from being a hypocrite or being a liar or having a different public view from your private view

7567710 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best
7567711 its important that as the web hosting industry moves forward we understand that internet users are seeking a customized personalized internet experience for both personal and professional reasons ultimately its about customer relationships providers and resellers need to work together to provide the support services and infrastructure that give users the best experience

7567783 starting today i think we can do even better by our students
7567784 i think we can create an even stronger academic climate in which to learn i think we can move students even closer to the heart of what we do and be even more mindful of their centrality to our mission
7567785 student centeredness should permeate everything we do and guide every decision we take
7567786 it should motivate us to continuously ask ourselves what can be improved and compel us to share those thoughts with each other

7567873 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7567874 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7567875 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7567876 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions

7567885 andrew was still playing with lego at 16 and 17 and that was a little bit weird but now its cool
7567886 because the students had the shared classroom experience when something came up outside of class that reminded them of material from class time it often got twittered
7567887 this served as a reinforcement connection between the material and the real world
7567888 a way to jot down a little reflection about the class how it went things that were frustrating or worked really well so that i can remember them later
7567889 if i thought something didnt go well ive had people say actually we understood that fine we were distracted by something else or we were just tired
7567890 were going to incorporate that technology at the classroom level
7567891 professors could send a message to their entire class to let them know that class has been canceled this week
7567892 unlike a direct message which can only be seen by the recipient placing user name directs the tweet twitter update at the intended recipient whilst allowing everyone to also see it this facilitates virtual classroom discussion anytime someone responds to you using the symbol it is logged in the replies section of your personal twitter page
7567893 as with the personal learning network pln facilitated by twitter in the edublogosphere usually through the twitterfox plugin for firefox students can also ask questions of those they only know online

7567916 my answer to the question as to whether rudy is more dangerous than bush of course he is hes smarter and more machiavellian a more apt question would be whether hes more dangerous than dick cheney probably not but its also why happily he wont be successful in his bid for the presidency
7567917 they are dangerous men who will lie about almost anyone or anything
7567918 at the end of the day i believe fully the president is doing the right thing and i think all we need is some attacks on american soil like we had on sept 11 2001 and the naysayers will come around very quickly to appreciate not only the commitment for president bush but the sacrifice that has been made by men and women to protect this country

7567961 the general has a right to his opinions but they should be based on facts
7567962 he has only been here since the end of may and in this time he has made overblown and incorrect judgments about how the city works

7568169 in the long term the positive effects on learning of reduced anxiety and disorientation will gradually be canceled by the negative effects of peer orientation thus follows the research evidence that early advantages of preschool education are not sustainable over time peer oriented kids go to school to be with their friends not to learn if these friends are also not into learning academic performance will slip when children go to school to be with one another they are primed only to learn enough not to stand out to remain with those their own age other than that learning is irrelevant and can even be a liability to peer relationships

7568243 the awus got their new leader im not going to quarterback 05 to 08
7568244 what im saying very clearly is that the big difference between then and now is that youve now got a labor government in with much better regulation and fairness is much more in the centre of the equation

7568262 in the next decade victoria will be faced with tens of thousands of dead hybrid car batteries with no environmentally sustainable way of disposing of them

7568520 j hrlich werden in deutschland knapp 40 000 diabetes bedingte amputationen vorgenommen nur die h lfte ist jedoch wirklich notwendig
7568521 in einigen f llen wird bereits nach einem jahr bei diabetespatienten ein fu amputiert obwohl mit etwas geduld und einsatz dieser durchaus zu retten w re
7568522 oftmals k mmern sich in den kliniken internisten um diabetiker die nicht immer das absolute fachwissen um die komplexit t der thematik haben
7568523 einige rzte sind einfach zu ungeduldig und k nnen den heilungsprozess nicht abwarten das ist ein ernsthaftes problem
7568524 der grund daf r d rfte sein dass eine amputation f r die betroffenen der anfang vom ende ist und sie sich innerlich aufgeben
7568525 durch die amputationen sind die patienten nicht mehr in der lage alleine f r sich zu sorgen und landen in der vielzahl in pflegeheimen
7568526 da kann doch kaum noch von einer erleichterung f r die patienten gesprochen werden
7568527 das problem bei diabetikern ist dass sie oftmals gar nicht mitbekommen dass sie eine wunde haben
7568528 dann reicht schon ein nicht bemerktes taschentuch im schuh aus dass sich eine blase unter dem fu bildet und diese kann sich bei nichtbehandlung entz nden
7568529 aus bagatellen kann sich bei diabetikern ganz schnell eine gro e entz ndung entwickeln

7568534 iata travel centre was created to reduce the number of passengers with insufficient or incorrect travel documents traditionally this information was provided by airlines and travel agents at time of booking but as more people are booking online this is no longer the case
7568535 it has become a very important destination site for people who want to be sure their travel documents are in order for hassle free travel
7568536 iata travel centre is emblematic of the sites in the travel ad network they drill down very deeply into the travel subjects they cover and provide ideas peer reviews and essential information to assure the best possible travel experience as a result visitors are engaged with content and advertising on these sites far longer than on ota sites

7568577 ive heard the rumours but they dont bother me in the slightest its a load of absolute nonsense a lot of it is down to jealousy
7568578 if you take all the airports in ireland all the little ones and the big ones is one of the only airports in ireland that we believe no drug has ever come through
7568579 we have staff in weston who have worked there since even before we bought it and like the guards on the beat on the street who know everything thats happening these people are there all the time and they know all the different people coming in and out and i would say that not one drug has ever come through
7568580 the people who are spreading these rumours are definitely liars in my opinion because they have no such proof and if they have then the police should know about it or we should know about it
7568581 i would love to get someone who could tell me directly some policeman or someone else about who is spreading these rumours about me and drugs not for money or anything but id love to take them out and i would bring them to court because theres no drugs in my business
7568582 there was so much inaccurate and misleading information at the time stories were printed that the drugs were found on the plane but no such thing ever happened the drugs were seized before they even entered the airport in belgium
7568583 there was even a story that my plane had been locked up along with the pilots at a time when it was actually in ireland and indeed was being flown around europe the pilots had been released and were at home with their families for more than a week when this report came out
7568584 people have claimed that there is no customs or security nothing could be further from the truth weston is one of the most secure airports in the country we have state of the art facilities better than many airports in ireland and even europe
7568585 at great expense we voluntarily installed x ray machines for baggage and people going through the airport and these machines can even detect drugs
7568586 there is also a dedicated office for customs at weston and we have an excellent working relationship with both customs and the gardai
7568587 and anyone that says that i can say straight out to them that they are absolute liars
7568588 katy frenchs death had absolutely nothing to do with me or my family i felt very sorry for her and for the family she seemed a very nice person but other than that it didnt affect me at all
7568589 i would have met katy three times in my life i thought she was a very nice girl and that her death was very sad i suppose all those types of people take some sort of drugs which is terrible really and jimmy my middle lad would have known her well but not that well
7568590 he would have known her for two or three months through andrea roche jim mansfields daughter in law because she would have held the beauty contests here in citywest
7568591 i heard rumours that it linked back to jim junior a few people said this that and the other about jimmy and the drugs but maybe it was lucky he was away that week he was in
7568592 ive heard people say he was with her that night and all this sort of thing but i happen to know he wasnt with her that night because he was away in spain
7568593 none of my sons have ever ever taken drugs i can sit here and honestly say that i would never have had to talk to any of them about drugs in my life because they are simply not that way inclined theyre always too busy doing something else
7568594 im improving now hopefully ill live another while i keep looking forward i seldom ever look back i like what i do and i like to be able to do it ive no great interest in going for holidays in the sun
7568595 i start now at 6 30am every morning and finish up early at 11pm each night but i did have a holiday there a few weeks ago i went off on a friday evening and i came back on a sunday
7568596 i love looking at antiques and going to auctions and getting things done up
7568597 i have a collection of antique aircraft which includes american president eisenhowers
7568598 i want to let all the people see and believe that what i decided to do when i first went into weston and my plans to make it a model airport have been done we have succeeded to a great extent so far and what were doing now will help that greatly
7568599 its probably a form of madness for me to be able to improve a property is a big thing
7568600 when i see all the people around who have lovely properties just lying there and dont bother about it i do wonder if i am mad
7568601 its unbelievable that there are so many beautiful properties around ireland just lying there down around
7568602 i dont feel i ever get stressed about things the doctors are telling me i should be doing this and that and i shouldnt be here at the office but stress to me is when a doctor tells me i have to stay at home i cant ever see myself stopping work as long as im able to do it i will do it
7568603 it feels like when i was a young lad going to school if you got a half a crown you felt great and the few quid youd have would still feel like that to be able to have it is a good thing
7568604 if money gets you to the stage where you forget about the people who are important to you and your friends from school youre then lost
7568605 i have money in property and in this and that but at the end of the day it means nothing to me really its no motivation at all to me i get satisfaction from what i do and it all coming right
7568606 money wouldnt come on my list of priorities at all all i want is to be able to get a bit of money to eat every week and thatll keep me going the family is my top priority i love to have them all together and were all very close
7568607 i certainly want a new heart and i cant get it something to keep me going a bit longer
7568608 theres nothing that i have ever done that would ever keep me awake at night
7568609 when i look back at everything i dont think i really have any regrets i couldnt find much fault with anything ive done

7568646 i have been here 30 years that is my home i am very proud of its all i got
7568647 its not right for the city to let 9 people sit on that board and vote and not even give me a right to speak my mind about it i didnt know anything about this
7568648 every morning you gotta see my place i got like 3 green acres every morning i wake up and look out my kitchen window i see pretty green grass and i have cows
7568649 and now i will wake up every morning and see a parking lot in my neighborhood i have nothing against schools but there is certain places they belong and dont belong and right is right and wrong is wrong and this is not right
7568650 i think it is a horrible thing they are doing to our neighborhood how will it enhance our neighborhood the street is not wide enough for a sidewalk but they can give us 125 students brought in every day
7568651 eddy lane is the best of franklin its a mix of old and new it adds to the historical and pastoral charm of franklin
7568652 recently the planning commission approved a site plan for a montesori school in franklin right down the road currently there is a residential home on 7 acres that home is from the 1860s the city planning commission did this without notification to myself or my neighbors they did this where it would dramatically change the character of a neighborhood and impact our traffic and our flood plane it will impact the drainage situation they signed off on the demolition of a 1860s house and they didnt feel that anyone on this street had the right to know
7568653 we asked them to explain why they remarked we didnt have to tell you
7568654 i feel betrayed to be honest with you most of us on this street have been here 20 plus years we had a right to know the city says it is not required under the old ordinance to notify the residents but should they have done so yes the city should have told residents about the pending plan franklin touts itself as a place to live our schools and shopping are great we are thin we are everything that everyone wants to be but somehow our city officials dont give us the common courtesy to inform us when a dramatic change is taking place in their neighborhood
7568655 our dream to create a school that looks and feels like a home and feels inviting to children can last in this community right now our montessori school is the only one in franklin we think it is a wonderful program and want it to exist into the future
7568656 we want to be good neighbors we have done everything we should through the city and the city feels we would be a good fit for that location and we would welcome any discussion with them that we can
7568657 we dont have a desire to grow past 155 students
7568658 we want to look and act like a home we might find common ground and make this work out we come onto west main and we have never had problems with traffic whatsoever and we feel our growth pattern will take five years to max out at 155 students and we can stagger drop off and pick up so it is not all at once we have parents coming in both directions if after that there is a problem we would welcome a crossing guard or any other alternatives that could helpful
7568659 well under the old ordinance that was not the case it was buy right zoning and as we would with any residence or business if it is properly zoned and it meets all the design standards and storm water control and other characteristics they can submit their application and obtain an approval from the planning commission with the new ordinance purposes of place of worship and schools there is a more laborious process where we do get out and require neighborhood meetings it does contain public information meetings up and above what is required by law
7568660 how would you feel if someone came to your neighborhood and pushed two houses down and built a school and didnt say anything to you about it
7568661 no i cant see any advantage to it because im happy with the life i have now
7568662 ive got the same two friends ive had since i was 12 and i cant see that changing

7568666 the elements the nepali people overthrew are again issuing challenges to bring down the maoist led government earlier than the first hundred days however they will not succeed
7568667 if attempts are made to oust us from the government we will mobilise the people
7568668 we are not afraid at all even if some elements boast their numbers of seats in the constituent assembly we will prove that we can sustain the government by mobilising the people
7568669 that is why one should not worry about the sustainability of the maoist led government
7568670 we should be doing songs with country rock and pop stars

7568704 the sacrifices we make in street demonstrations today will be compensated a hundredfold for the time being we shall be beaten more than once in the street the government will continue to emerge victorious from street fighting again and again but these will be pyrrhic victories a few more victories like these and the defeat of absolutism is inevitable
7568705 we must mobilize every trace of discontent into a giant bellows that will burn the system down
7568706 the people will be in the street and no one will know who called them there

7568708 it is a shame that the u s administration could not push this agreement through congress in the time there was
7568709 if you take into account the recent political events congress is unlikely to pass it so to avoid it being blocked it would be right and proper to recall it and let it be looked at by the new administration
7568710 the question of peaceful use of nuclear energy should not depend on the current political situation
7568711 a change in the strategy of the resistance is based on the existing conditions
7568712 these are sensitive conditions we must be ready for any possibility if the zionist entity will insist on displaying aggression towards the palestinians the answer is to develop a palestinian response
7568713 we will be exercising our rights to fish when the solitaire comes in we have a licence to fish and we have been fishing here for generations if they want to move us they will have to get a court injunction
7568714 some of which were very distressing to myself and my family
7568715 for the record as a result of the attempts by shell to bribe the fishing community into accepting their flawed project my son and i have been forced to resign from the eifa to maintain our lawful fishing rights also it should be noted that not all eifa members have agreed to either the offered compensation framework or produced water discharge suggestion indeed a significant proportion of the remaining members have not accepted any offer from corrib partners shell statoil and marathon
7568716 the current attempt by shell to give the false impression of consent from the fishermen is identical to the situation in 2005 with the good people of rossport and the same deceptive tactics are being used to try and fool the general public and put neighbour against neighbour

7568718 you are not welcome here our whole community has been severely disrupted and there are very serious reservations about the safety considerations regarding the proposed pipeline especially in regard to the abysmal safety record of shell here and at locations worldwide we are also unhappy about the blatant disregard for our pristine environment broadhaven bay and sruwaddacon bay are special areas of conservation of international importance for marine life
7568719 in light of our concerns we are obliged to stand firm against this project and do all in our power to prevent it in its present unacceptable form
7568720 we do not seek confrontation with you and your crew and we feel sure that you would not wish to go ahead with pipe laying when there are such serious safety issues unresolved there is also the question of the legality of laying this seaward pipeline before there has been any agreement on the landward route

7568795 having this other person or people say this happened to me too in the same kind of way can absolutely increase convictions
7568796 juries can see oh theres a pattern hes done this before it can combat the idea that they cant convict an 80 year old guy because now they can see hes been doing this for the past 40 years
7568797 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has

7568800 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for
7568801 joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset
7568802 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7568803 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7568804 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7568805 hillary clinton d ny had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7568806 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7568807 its a total diss to sen clinton it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7568808 computerspiele mit gewaltinhalten f hren fter zu erh hten aggressivit tsleveln als beispielsweise das ansehen von horror oder gewaltfilmen
7568809 es handelt sich bei den ursachen f r aggressivit t vielmehr um ein quintett an faktoren in dem der medienkonsum aber eine schl sselrolle einnimmt
7568810 wer in einem elternhaus aufw chst in dem gewalt an der tagesordnung ist ist f r gewalt in medien anf lliger
7568811 umgekehrt werden die einfl sse von medialer gewalt in sehr harmonischen und liebevollen familien stark abgefedert
7568812 das ergebnis war eindeutig wer viele gewaltt tige computerspiele spielte wurde auch im realen leben aggressiver
7568813 die jugendlichen spielen sich in einen rausch und sind in ihrer welt helden
7568814 das ist im gegensatz zu gewalt und horrorfilmen genau das problem an derartigen spielen denn die jugendlichen schalten oftmals nicht nach 90 minuten ab und gehen danach ihrem sonstigen leben nach sondern die spiele sind teilweise ihr leben
7568815 im meer k nnen wir all das testen was wir auf der donau oder am neusiedlersee nicht berpr fen k nnen

7568839 the authors have admitted that there were falsehoods in the original manuscript and have made amendments accordingly
7568840 im skinny so i dont have much body fat maybe maybe not
7568841 fear or threats should not keep a book from being published it would be principally and entirely a renewal of all that denmark has already been through with the mohammed cartoon affair

7568862 similar to what youre seeing in the housing market many people are taking advantage of lower prices on trucks and suvs through lease transfer
7568863 many consumers are willing to cope with the price of gas knowing that they only have a short term commitment no money down and lower monthly payments compared to shopping at a dealer

7568871 well know more as the week goes on ua coach mike stoops said
7568872 were all a little bit unsure right now hopefully its cured as quickly as possible well see
7568873 he has been one of our more consistent guys out there but its what you do with a football team someone else has to step up and a j has done some good things this camp
7568874 we may change our sets and what we feature may change
7568875 whatever our best 11 are for every given situation we have a lot of flexibility
7568876 unfortunately he is behind robbie right now but he can be a very important player for us a j could probably start for almost any team in the pac 10
7568877 i think the coaching staff has done a good job of preparing me for something like this simmons said
7568878 that wall has got to be high that wall has got to be strong he said
7568879 when people come to attack you theyre looking for weakness the cardinal ended camp last week with similar enthusiasm even as the teams health became a bit of an issue
7568880 one of our coaches came up before camp started and said all the work weve done in the summer youve just prepared yourself to do well this season we had to come out and have a good camp to be able to do well this season
7568881 we really want to show people what were all about this year junior defensive end erik lorig said
7568882 i think everyones thinking about that this is definitely one of those top feelings i must say above all else that ive had here in terms of our team i think its the first time a lot of people are able to admit that everyone has the same bond coming out of camp
7568883 he doesnt say anything about his team i dont see anything about our team
7568884 there has been a lot of surprises from the young guys stepping up and learning the system a little quicker than we thought to having all three quarterbacks play at a high level he said

7568897 from the standpoint of my coauthors mark hiller and my model it fits really well
7568898 most studies suggest that the bump a vp can give a ticket even in his or her home state is very small moreover while my analysis is still preliminary i recently conducted a survey experiment that suggests
7568899 the modern american vice presidency the transformation of a political institution
7568900 it is the first time a presidential nominee has chosen a running mate who competed for the nomination but was not the runner up
7568901 biden is also the first running mate from delaware a major national party has chosen
7568902 has a reputation for working across the aisle and is popular with his colleagues so the choice reinforces senator obamas message of working in a bipartisan way to address national problems he is an effective campaigner and his presence on the ticket should help senator obama remain above the fray
7568903 this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love to restore americas soul
7568904 vice presidential selection invariably entails choosing between real human beings with strengths and weaknesses there are no perfect choices
7568905 the obama campaign presumably believes that given the options it had that risk is outweighed by the advantages he brings
7568906 re neil kinnock its hard for me to believe that will be a significant issue the political statute of limitations must have run on that didnt biden credit kinnock in some earlier speeches yes he did which certainly makes it seem a less clear cut case of knowing plagiarism re the iraq war almost all presidential democrats supported it initially and bidens been a pretty severe critic and has said he made a mistake
7568907 i was an irish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe its a saying barack you heard me say before my dad repeated it and repeated it said champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up its how quickly you get up ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7568908 the first element is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in baghdad the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues baghdad would become a federal zone while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection

7568911 unfortunately the expenses associated with medical treatment along with loss of income during that period of time are simply too much of a financial hurdle at this point liquidating the domain name portfolio and using the proceeds to pay for medical and living expenses is the most responsible way for us to manage an unfortunate set of circumstances
7568912 our strategy combines the use of youtube style videos audio testimonials and blogging tools as a more effective way to communicate with prospective clients and customers
7568913 one problem with most of todays industry standard websites is that theyre static and provide text based content with a photo or two prospective buyers want more than whats written about a dentist or attorney on their website they want to see and hear them in action they want to hear what other patients and clients have to say about their experiences most people are using the internet to do initial research before they take the time to meet face to face with a service professional and online audio video is one of the best ways for a service provider to make that initial connection
7568914 we are on the leading edge of changes in the industry unfortunately you dont get to choose when something like this is going to happen
7568915 this comprehensive portfolio is the perfect compliment to other types of marketing services including search engine optimization website design and development or even traditional advertising and promotion for a progressive company who is looking to differentiate themselves from their competitors and provide additional value to their customers these domain names will provide a great return on investment to a buyer who recognizes the power of the internet
7568916 we are currently accepting offers from potential buyers and plan to complete a sale sometime in the next couple of months then once we get through the surgery and treatment later this year well move forward and make the most of the opportunities we have at that point
7568917 health care organizations that contract with flexcare medical staffing can look to this certification as an assurance that flexcare demonstrates a commitment to providing and continuously improving quality services
7568918 this certification recognizes flexcares dedication to providing registered nurses that are qualified to provide safe high quality care to patients
7568919 were proud to receive the joint commissions gold seal of approval

7568930 sienta las nuevas bases de lo que es posible en la industria del arte interactivo
7568931 i want to say at least something about the pain existing in the world today i write in the night although it is daytime i write in a night of shame
7568932 by shame i dont mean individual guilt shame as im coming to understand it is a species feeling which in the long run corrodes the capacity for hope and prevents us looking far ahead we look down at our feet thinking only of the next small step
7568933 benda ini apa ya bentuknya pipih kalau dipencet pencet ia lentur tetapi bukan karet agak transparan tetapi bukan plastik hmmm
7568934 the development of this site will enable us to continue expansion of our silicon business in the most cost efficient manner and will consequently support recs further growth downstream as well as our ambitious long term cost target
7568935 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7568936 ted brings with him extremely relevant experience from his time at lionore and has great strengths in multinational finance accounting and treasury operations
7568937 our primary responsibility and need at this stage has been to remove the recalled products from the market weve provided the list of products and weve been in direct contact and have talked with every single one of the customers and distributors that have received and distributed that product
7568938 we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7568939 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7568940 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over
7568941 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7568942 inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns
7568943 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7568944 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7568945 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7568946 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on
7568947 after receiving and evaluating the mandatory requirements for the joint support ship project from the bidders the crown has determined that the proposals were not compliant with the basic terms of the request for proposals rfp among other compliance failures both bids were significantly over the established budget provisions
7568948 it would have meant 700 workers working in marystown specifically building three large navy ships over a course of seven or eight or nine years
7568949 it would also of course meant the fast tracking of the construction of a new shipyard here in marystown with a large scale graving dock so adding a 100 million plus in new infrastructure
7568950 this was something that was going to develop further down the line a little bit so in some ways the delay is better for us
7568951 we can finish off the provincial ferries and then go on to the other vessels if were successful
7568952 russia intends to inform various wto partners of its withdrawal from accords that contradict its interests
7568953 it turns out that we dont see or feel any pluses from membership and if there are some we still carry a burden
7568954 we need to get things clear with our partners we need to think most seriously about protecting our manufacturers
7568955 this doesnt mean we should renounce our strategic course towards the wto but there should be some clarifications on this question elementary fairness should prevail
7568956 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7568957 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a rally
7568958 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7568959 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7568960 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7568961 i love you very much your big sister give you a kiss and a hug and a softhead
7568962 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years

7568965 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism

7568968 we are continually making improvements to our products and have developed a solid partner program in an effort to accelerate our growth we look forward to making the list again next year
7568969 in an internet economy the competition is not just the business down the street or across town but anyone selling similar products or services online
7568970 as a result smbs are being driven to become more enterprise like in their network architectures while remaining on an smb budget
7568971 todays smb customers want real value we understand that this is more than just a price tag it is a measure of factors such as reliability performance and support
7568972 adtrans netvanta products uniquely address each of these factors and deliver a host of key benefits that make them the best value on the market for the smb or distributed enterprise

7569119 this is a very exciting discovery the sleipner area is still very prospective and this well confirms that there is also a good chance of making oil discoveries in this area
7569120 the discovery is a result of focused efforts to find more hydrocarbons that may be phased in to sleipner i will credit my exploration organisation for coming up with the idea that there might be an oil column below the gas at dagny which was discovered 30 years ago
7569121 i am pleased that the result met with our expectations and that dry gas was confirmed in a reservoir with good reservoir qualities

7569140 i want people to understand the plight of the less fortunate dogs in this country
7569141 part of my job is helping to educate the families i work with but also the general public on what it takes to be a responsible dog owner and since the american kennel club is celebrating responsible dog ownership in september i thought i would too
7569142 when i work with a family i provide that walks play sessions transportation to vet appointments and doggy daycare in fact many of my clients say i take better care of their pets than they do
7569143 shelter dogs and dogs who spend the majority of their lives outside away from their families are especially susceptible to developing problem behaviors due to lack of environmental enrichment
7569144 people think the dog is enjoying his time outside and that hes exercising but hes not
7569145 and it isnt their fault we have failed them and we fail them again when we let them languish in shelters
7569146 our shelters do the best they can they struggle just to have enough money to provide food and a warm dry bed let alone toys and activities to help dogs live as normal lives as possible as they wait for a new family to find them thats why i want to help
7569147 i love dogs not just my own but all dogs
7569148 they have given me so much through the years that i just want to give back to them

7569213 this is an exciting time in the renewable energy business and we feel fortunate to have teamed up with a visionary company in american alternative energy systems that understands the huge potential of our gasifier to revolutionize the waste to energy sector
7569214 the wte technology represents a significant breakthrough in the way we will destroy troublesome waste streams while producing local renewable energy the focus of the waste to energy sector has evolved over the past few years away from incineration with waste heat recovery towards very efficient low emission gasification systems that produce a combustible gas rather than simply burning the material to generate heat to produce steam
7569215 this relatively low btu syngas works extremely well with the new breed of specialized combined heat and power chp systems and maximizes the overall usage of the stored energy in the waste while minimizing the huge volumes of nox nitrous oxides produced by incineration of waste streams with free flowing air
7569216 we at wte canada see an opportunity to provide a clean inexpensive way of converting the most difficult and noxious waste streams into the maximum possible amount of energy with no impact on the environment except a positive one

7569224 el fc barcelona hizo una pretemporada envidiable hizo alternar a la mayor a de sus figuras y el esquema del equipo casi no sufri cambios pese a la salida de deco y de giovani y en contrapartida la llegada de hleb y daniel alves guardiola tiene equipo para campeonar en la liga a menos que suceda algo extra o arbitrajes sanciones lesiones barcelona debe ser el campe n
7569225 creo que es obvio que el real madrid volver a ser campe n porque tiene una platilla con la cual puede hacer grandes cosas qued demostrado la temporada pasada creo que se han hecho pocos fichajes pero son suficientes para ser tricampeones y poder aspirar a la champions y a la copa del rey el real madrid es el principal candidato a llev rsela y se la disputar con el villarreal y el atl tico de madrid
7569226 despu ss de varios a os y de tener a s lo dos favoritos el campeonato la liga espa ola cada vez est m s re ido por lo cual ahora tengo a cuatro contendientes que buscar n el t tulo el mejor sin duda el madrid con hombres de experiencia y j venes sobresalientes el barcelona el m s destruido tras las salidas de deco y ronaldinho en tercer lugar el atl tico de madrid dirigido por javier aguirre con un equipo din mico y nuevas contrataciones y por ltimo el villarreal equipo sin mucha luz pero que puede dar batalla
7569227 el campe n va a ser el real sporting de gij n no creo que lo vaya a ser pero es lo que deseamos todos los gijoneses mi segunda opci n es el real madrid

7569280 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp and no one knows where the wounded people have been taken
7569281 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7569282 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7569283 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7569284 the unamid leadership is closely monitoring the situation with serious concern
7569285 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7569286 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7569287 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp to assess the situation and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7569288 i know from ngos working inside kalma that there is fighting inside the camp but they didnt give me details
7569289 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7569290 hillary clintons worked with both of these guys and shes come to the same conclusion barack obama is her guy
7569291 want a leader whose judgement and experience they can trust
7569292 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7569293 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years

7569295 everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts
7569296 the facts are these the assembly had no list of real spending reductions that would have allowed us to achieve additional savings and further strengthen the states finances
7569297 if they do have such a list the governor should make it public immediately
7569298 instead the assembly partnered with the governor to propose new revenue by increasing taxes on car life and health insurance plans across the state and increasing the gross receipts tax on hospitals leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes
7569299 if the governor is serious about cutting spending he should embrace our constitutional amendment to cap state spending and cut billions more going forward

7569392 an investment of 41 million in fertiliser research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
7569393 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
7569394 tvas fertiliser program is recognised as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertiliser research and development
7569395 its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilisers to help avert hunger and famine
7569396 tva technology fuelled the sweeping advances of u s farmers in food and fibre production in the 60s to 80s
7569397 today fertilisers are responsible for more than a third of total u s crop production
7569398 the 57 billion return from a 41 million investment included about 49 billion from use of high analysis fertilisers and 8 billion from process development and improvement thats a benefit cost ratio of more than 20 to 1
7569399 tva followed promising new fertilisers from conception to production to national acceptance by farmers and the fertiliser industry
7569400 its program was based on fundamental research followed by process development and technology transfer
7569401 tva then stopped work on that project and moved to develop newer and more promising technologies
7569402 i am concerned about the state of the fertiliser industry itself
7569403 work should begin now on the next generation of fertiliser products using advanced techniques such as nanotechnology and molecular biology especially in conjunction with plant genetics research smart fertiliser products that will release nutrients only at the time and in the amount needed should be developed
7569404 the world needs a major research effort to improve the effectiveness of fertiliser production and use
7569405 fertiliser is a commodity industry and it is unlikely the industry alone will undertake the research some public investment is probably required
7569406 to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
7569407 the need for increased food is escalating but new agricultural technology is not keeping pace
7569408 an effective research program to develop a new range of fertilisers should be a key element of any long term strategy to alleviate the food crisis
7569409 most fertiliser products used today were developed when energy seemed abundant and cheap but with rising prices we should develop a new generation of fertiliser products that use plant nutrients more efficiently
7569410 such innovations will require investments in research but such costs would be miniscule compared to the benefits for humanity

7569421 consumers have trusted the makers of over the counter medications with the health of their families for many years national medicine abuse awareness month presents a timely opportunity to build community awareness and alert parents and teens that abusing medicine to get high is very dangerous
7569422 while surveys show that overall illicit drug use among youth is on a downward trend unfortunately the rates of over the counter and prescription drug abuse are holding steady
7569423 designating august as national medicine abuse awareness month will help bring this issue to the radar screen and i hope community organizations take advantage of this opportunity to raise awareness about this dangerous trend

7569440 ten years ago when i talked about school choice i was literally tarred and feathered
7569441 i was literally brought into a broom closet by a union and told i would never win office if i kept talking about charters
7569442 d c schools chancellor michelle rhee is negotiating what is probably the most aggressive union contract in the country shell be able to fire teachers but also be able to pay them more
7569443 the american federation of teachers which i dont think does anything for the people of the district of columbia is weighing in against it
7569444 and the only thing i can think of is that the heads of the union they want to keep their jobs

7569456 i think he wants to fight those big mega fights because thats the kind of fight we want to be involved with right now
7569457 i think its a combination of seeing what the potential opponent is and also seeing what the ufc wants to do at the end of the day this is a business and they need to sell fights they need to sell a lot of pay per views and they need to sell tickets so we want to be involved with those types of fights
7569458 were not looking past patrick cote but i think well take one step at a time and see what happens but yeah if a chuck liddell fight came up wed take it
7569459 whoever the ufc wants to put in front of us he wants to fight the best and whoever that may be at the time thats who he wants to fight

7569470 youre not going to talk to the class about climate change
7569471 the bigger point was to consider what one might say of their generation seventy years from now i talked of their destiny at least as i see it saying that their generation will be the one to develop solutions and help us understand how to live in a changing world they would do so in part because they must we talked of what it might feel like to be part of such a cause or to know that their generation and their country would be leading an effort to help protect the planet
7569472 lucky you your generation will have all the excitement of dealing with our climate challenge
7569473 on this ecs board i did not get very far with my attempts at overclocking i attribute this to the board only having a 4 pin cpu power connector and a four phase voltage regulator setup i could not get enough clean power through the board to sustain a stable overclock i did get the ecs gf8200a up to 2 94ghz by bumping the cpu frequency up to 210mhz from the stock 200mhz and upping the cpu multiplier to 14x however to do this i had to push the cpu voltage up to 1 55v which is in my opinion the highest i would ever like to see the vcore of a cpu with everything stable at 2 94ghz thats where the overclocking benchmarks will be run

7569476 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
7569477 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime
7569478 and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution

7569483 without some systematized method of daily accountability the natural result will be to stray off course then at the end of the year you look back and say if only in order to prevent that yearly if only you have to squeeze that annual accountability down into each and every day when you look back on your day and see you goofed you can immediately regroup and recommit to doing a better job the next day better to do this every single day instead of going dark and then being painfully surprised at the end of the year if you have no system then either old habits or just plain chaos will dominate in the long run regardless of your intentions and motivation

7569516 when youre working with creative people they tend not to focus on the technical side of things
7569517 when they come up with a requirement they dont ask how they can get that done they say they have a requirement and how quickly can it be done
7569518 our old system was basically ad hoc and every time you needed to provide a new solution be it more storage or an application server you had to do a lot of research and work out what was going to work together
7569519 you had to make sure the white box you were working with had the performance in the correct places for the application you were trying to deploy

7569529 overall the business case for us was a no brainer
7569530 we knew we were spending a lot on printing but had no way of monitoring exactly how much and where it was being spent

7569539 our product needs to have quality of design quality of concepts architecture of the system but it also must have quality of execution in the code we write and how well it performs compared with what is required
7569540 we needed to be able to test such a complex environment and not spend a massive amount of time managing the testing process tracking requirements and issues and referring them back to the developer
7569541 we used to do all of those things on spreadsheets and kind of manually and it was very laborious
7569542 we can now execute a test process in a week rather than a month so if we allow two weeks for testing we will be doing it in half the time and will do twice as much
7569543 it allows the team to share resources because there is a single spot where we have all of the requirements recorded
7569544 we can register the test results and know what issues occurred by function in which particular release of the product and who were the developers so there is complete traceability which is very important
7569545 we can also pinpoint areas where the number of errors is greater and it gives an idea as to which team member has a higher than average number of incidents
7569546 the moment we start capturing the process data in the database it is there to crunch the numbers and analyse it
7569547 if i sent software to thousands of sites and it had a problem that would be intolerable we just cannot do that
7569548 for a company that strives to produce impeccable product it is difficult to live without such a tool
7569549 we already have certain components of process management in our own application so we need to do a bit of integration
7569550 we have a help desk system that tracks all the calls and ultimately we would like to get that integrated with what we do there because some of those calls would translate into software defects

7569675 we believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country
7569676 whats really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go literally causing physical harm to be beautiful according to the standards perpetuated by a youth obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages 24 hours a day

7569691 we believe all hospitals no matter how well theyre doing have the opportunity to improve the care they deliver to patients
7569692 the publication of this data was a way to continue improving the processes of care
7569693 we are very proud of the valley baptist medical center harlingen team of nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals whose dedication made these better than national results for the treatment of heart failure possible
7569694 we are proud to be one of only three hospitals in texas and 37 in the nation to receive this recognition
7569695 our ranking by cms hospital compare as one of the lowest in mortality rates for congestive heart failure coupled with our ranking as the number one cardiac surgery program in the state further reflects that our community does not have to leave the valley for heart care
7569696 i think we can handle the rainfall estimates theyre telling us
7569697 primarily the state of emergency is really precautionary to go into the weekend so if we need to ramp up we have that authority
7569698 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7569699 at these boat reunions theyll spend money on hotels and eat at our restaurants
7569700 some people dont understand that the more you have to bring people into the city the more businesses that get support
7569701 i think its the biggest joke ive ever heard of
7569702 from the numbers ive seen on it and its been awhile it was not making money and the city is having to subsidize it and our rec centers are falling apart
7569703 were continually told by city officials that we cant do this and we cant do that
7569704 yet we continue to spend millions of dollars down there or will when its all said and done
7569705 ninety percent of the people i talk to about where i stand on issues the last question they ask me is youre not going to buy any more boats or submarines are you
7569706 im sure there are things i would have done differently in the last 20 years but thats not one of them
7569707 to me thats a big part of our riverfront development
7569708 as much of a symbol of our appreciation and sacrifices for our military on our watch as it is a tourist attraction
7569709 it goes way beyond what some refer to as rusting metal
7569710 they come here and go to central high and the clinton presidential library its a twoday trip they do every year
7569711 we have a lot of school groups that repeat year after year
7569712 the thing the city council and the mayor have been able to do is to attract tourism into the city
7569713 that riverboat is one small item to that whole package
7569714 to me it goes deep into showing a respect for the sacrifice made by the military
7569715 im all for the veterans and it probably is something for those folks from out of town
7569716 i dont see a reason for supporting that from what ive seen its not that big of a deal
7569717 sen obama has committed time and again that iowa would be the nations first caucus hes said it publicly hes said it privately and i have not reason to believe otherwise
7569718 we want to repair the process so in the future theres no doubt theres no question
7569719 i have no doubt that the caucuses will continue to havethe feel of a community meeting of a precinct meeting that they have always had and they will stay first
7569720 thank you to my co nominees kristen and kurt i probably prefer them to me theyre great
7569721 its more than a job to all of us and sometimes just as in our personal lives bad things happen
7569722 after every one weve asked ourselves what could we have done better or different but theres nothing that connects them together
7569723 i didnt really come to the zoo thinking id lose a friend that day
7569724 in any substantial zoological collection you have just as much chance of death as a human population none of these deaths were related
7569725 every animal death is taken seriously and records are maintained
7569726 but each one of these cases presented completely different and unrelated circumstances and theres no linkage that would prompt any sort of investigation by us
7569727 at first i thought hed be all right but after examining him i realized what a good call they had made he was obviously very ill and they had on the basis of his behavior determined that they made the right judgment call unfortunately they had the wrong outcome
7569728 there was nothing that could have been done earlier to detect a problem like that
7569729 weve gained a tremendous amount of biological knowledge from gorillas that have died
7569730 were studying their health challenges to learn how to treat them better and keep them living longer
7569731 and people pay more attention when theyre born and when they die we understand that its an opportunity to talk about the circle of life death is not something that just happens in the wild
7569732 and each one even a chicken and a snake is sad for us we can learn and we have to learn about why deaths happen because at the end of the day these animals are dependent on us for care and because they belong to the community and its our job to keep them healthy and happy
7569733 it was really nice to see erica michaud get her first career goal
7569734 for her to take an aggressive stance and lead the team says a lot about her character and what she is willing to do for her team
7569735 the mou will come into effect immediately upon signature petrosa would like to acquire an oil producing asset in venezuela and receive a direct crude allocation from pdvsa in the short term between six months and one year
7569736 in the medium term between one and two years offshore natural gas opportunities and opportunities that commercialize our gtl technology and lng opportunities will be investigated
7569737 we are producing around 2 5 million bpd at the quota
7569738 we have a little spare capacity in case its needed we hope by the first half of 2009 to reach 3 million bpd
7569739 were not really worried that we will not reach this number
7569740 this time i am sure project kuwait has to make it to the floor
7569741 it has had full discussion in the past at committee level
7569742 we are going where there is natural growth of oil demand in the world
7569743 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7569744 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7569745 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7569746 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7569747 oh how i wish i could do it all again
7569748 when i invited a friend round to mums house for tea he engaged her in conversation about mikhail gorbachev quick as a flash she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7569749 it took us all time to realize that she couldnt remember a newspaper headline she had just read or what shed had for breakfast that morning
7569750 he avoided driving up whitehall because as their car passed downing street she would look up wondering why they hadnt turned in
7569751 we believe all hospitals no matter how well theyre doing have the opportunity to improve the care they deliver to patients
7569752 the publication of this data was a way to continue improving the processes of care

7569756 cell phone only households are similar to landline households in political attitudes
7569757 people are truthful in public opinion surveys but there are times when the truth is stretched a bit a recent wall street journal story reported that in a 2005 harris poll 58 percent of interviewees told the live telephone interviewer that they exercise regularly but in an online survey only 35 percent reported exercising regularly
7569758 reluctant to say theyre voting against a candidate because of race as a result polls tend to overstate the level of support for a black candidate by five to 10 points
7569759 nearly every national poll interviews only registered voters but some try to identify those people who are most likely to vote
7569760 are considered to be more predictive of the actual election results because about six out of every 10 registered voters will go to the polls in november
7569761 if one day makes such a difference in polls results
7569762 how accurate can polls be three months before an election
7569763 im talking only about scientifically designed polls that use random sampling not internet surveys or other amateur efforts that do not purport to represent an entire electorate
7569764 we know from the old days 50 to 100 years ago that people who were less well off actually did better
7569765 they were working as laborers they ate rice and beans and they couldnt afford cigarettes
7569766 short term changes in pollution have been tied to heart attacks
7569767 schwarzenegger is governing california he will not be as a person in the film
7569768 remains an architect unshackled by limits of the real world
7569769 it involves people of all ages and abilities and addresses the needs of those who are socially excluded
7569770 it is a positive scheme for communities as it strengthens their cultural and linguistic identities and enables them to experience performances of all music
7569771 the south wales valleys have a rich tradition of music making much of it fostered and inspired by the churches and chapels that have been the focus of community life for generations the christian life is often described as a journey where we travel in heart and mind towards a deeper knowledge of the god who draws us to himself it is therefore appropriate in our journey to this great christian shrine to have brought with us something of our culture to celebrate and offer in thanksgiving and praise
7569772 the catalyst consists of a carbon material with multiple molecules attached to its surface these molecules dramatically speed up the decomposition of plant cellulose making ethanol production much more efficient

7569775 we bring these kids into the courtroom in handcuffs with armed deputies
7569776 uses walking restraints for safety and prevention of elopement when clients are sent to an urgent medical appointment or court hearings that they cant miss early in their admission
7569777 the fabric restraints are only used when a patient is determined to be a flight risk and are removed immediately after a patient has returned safely to the facility
7569778 a board certified psychiatrist with extensive experience in childhood trauma and behavioral management must write an order for the use of restraints
7569779 conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations and ultimately dismissed the complaint
7569780 these kids already have mental health problems i would imagine this would exacerbate them these are not bad children and they have not done anything wrong they are just ill
7569781 we know from the old days 50 to 100 years ago that people who were less well off actually did better
7569782 they were working as laborers they ate rice and beans and they couldnt afford cigarettes
7569783 short term changes in pollution have been tied to heart attacks
7569784 what we do here is the engineering and developing of the product not the field work
7569785 real sailors and navy officers oversee the work so the navy gets what it wants at the end of the day
7569786 its the model program on how to do it right
7569787 it was absolutely critical its not just hardware but the people who realize what the system can and cannot do
7569788 the requirements for the aegis system come from the pentagon
7569789 but the lockheed martin engineers have gotten smart and come up with their own upgrades the information flows both ways between the navy and industry
7569790 we test the radar and simulate things to test the whole system you have to go to a ship at sea
7569791 japan was our first international customer they bought four aegis ships and came back and bought two more systems
7569792 we have a philosophy build a little test a little
7569793 if we continue to update the system and see results
7569794 we could be working out of moorestown for a long time

7569804 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7569805 i remember landing under sniper fire we just ran with our heads down
7569806 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labour while the games were going on

7569838 you arrive on an autumn afternoon alone no parents around to snuffle you here or there no brother to abide only the autumnal air crackling around you and other students adrift and wondering why exactly they are here what it is that makes these next years essential to them why they couldnt just stay home where their friends are where the parents who nurtured them are though youve longed to escape the daily routines of high school the daily routine of work at your fathers esso station the tang of battery acid when your fingers touch your tongue the black embedded in the whorls longed as well to escape the comic nightmare played out by you and your parents where love and habit indifference and hate twine about one another so tightly only a knife could unbraid them to leave all this behind all the mistakes and embarrassments of adolescence the missed moments missed shots and kisses all your childish fears and cruelties to come here then to the university the old campus sprawled across hills in the shadow of the boston mountains a new beginning yes though even this young you know your past clanks inside you like pots in a tinkers sack know too that already it has shaped you though not definitively and that you cherish sometimes too lovingly its sores and sorrows and solitudes

7569842 the market has changed and there is no value for 42 inch 46 inch and 50 inch md rptvs but there is great value in the screen sizes above 60 inch
7569843 i personally collect anime figurines because it is a work of art
7569844 it isnt easy to sculpt a human body and make it look real and i only collect figurines which are able to capture the body movement and feeling of a certain character
7569845 i see figuring collecting as a hobby like how people collecting stamps and coins
7569846 and just like how rare stamps and coins can fetch high prices in the market the same goes for figurines most anime figurines have a limited release and if the demand is overwhelming the value of the figurine may increase several fold
7569847 the amount of detail and hard work put into sculpting anime figurines is also another thing that attracts me i even use them as models for photography
7569848 while i do not deny that figurines for adults do exist these figurines only make up a very small niche of the total figurine market
7569849 it is actually easier to find a normal decent figurine than an adult one unless you really go for it
7569850 adult figurines also clearly marked with an 18 and above rating which is printed on the box for easy reference and even then these figurines are always sold clothed and never nude just that there is the option to cast them off
7569851 i see anime figurines as 3d representatives of my favourite characters looking at them evokes fond memories of certain anime series
7569852 while it is true that some anime figurine can cost around rm300 this is due to the highly detailed sculpting and the effort that the sculptor has put into creating it
7569853 also a market survey of japanese figurine catalog shows that only a very small percentage of figurines are adult oriented figurines made by good reputable companies like good smile and alter are 100 clean and fit for all ages
7569854 action has to be taken as such pornographic dolls affect societys moral values
7569855 we dont collect figurines because we get turned on by them we just like the details of the sculpture and the character
7569856 these erotic looking dolls are actually harder to find than character figurines its not like you walk into any toy shop and its there and even if they want to shut down these shops we can hop across to singapore to buy them if we really want to lol
7569857 i wish they dont just lump every collector into the same category not all of us figurine collectors collect naked dolls

7569907 living systems are intrinsically robust against cells dying or being damaged
7569908 the behaviour of most organs is an emerging feature resulting from the interaction of many cells where no cell is particularly robust or even aware of the whole behaviour
7569909 the starting point in winsoc was to provide mathematical models of biological systems and translate them into algorithms to determine how the sensor nodes should interact with each other
7569910 our indian partners have buried sensors in the terrain with the capability of monitoring the humidity and porosity of the terrain and the acceleration forces
7569911 the sensors are then linked to a satellite which gathers the data and conveys them to the control centre
7569912 the first is related to the monitoring of the earth with a system capable of autonomous decisions
7569913 this is particularly important in remote areas where it is difficult to recharge batteries or replace defective nodes
7569914 we believe that cross fertilisation of ideas from biology to engineering and vice versa can provide substantial benefits to both areas

7569929 this is a landmark event in the evolution of focused ultrasound surgery

7569936 mrgfus is already very important in some areas of medicine and can become very important in neurosurgery because of the minimally invasiveness of this tool mrgfus could be used in neurooncology neurovascular and functional neurosurgical cases one of the most attractive features is the possibility to eliminate the need of radiation therapy and its unwelcome side effects mrgfus 2008 will be a very helpful meeting because more physicians need to be aware of mrgfus technology
7569937 mrgfus 2008 in washington dc will be a very exciting opportunity for a multi disciplinary team of experts to present and discuss the future it should be very helpful in increasing awareness and will accelerate the advancement of the entire field mrgfus is a major part of our clinical research currently and will grow and become a major treatment option for many of our patients
7569938 the mrgfus 2008 meeting will be the first major international scientific congress addressing the rationale for and feasibility of focal therapy for prostate cancer it will bring together experts in imaging and treatment technology with experts in the diseases i think it will launch an exciting new era in minimally invasive treatment of cancer mrgfus promises to play a major role in oncology in the future it will be extremely valuable for urology and for surgical oncology in general
