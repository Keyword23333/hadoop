230102 that is why i am proposing that we pay for this rebate by taxing the windfall profits of oil companies so we can use some of their record profits to help families pay record prices
230103 these energy independence efforts will cost money a lot of money and that is why congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay it will be money well spent unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil these funds will be paid by americans to americans these funds will go to fight not to increase inflation and unemployment
230104 president carter wednesday signed into law the windfall profits tax bill designed to put a tax on the profits oil companies will make from the lifting of price controls on domestic oil
230105 from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 1 2 to 8 0 320 to 1 269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from between 3 and 13
230106 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
230107 an extremely complicated tax to comply with and to administer
230108 the oil industry maintained all along that the wpt was an extremely complicated tax to comply with and to administer the irs and the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office both agreed with the industrys claim and the eight year experience with the tax also tended to support this
230109 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
230110 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost
230111 the conference agreement provides for 14 6 billion in tax breaks and credits between 2005 and 2015 including 2 8 billion for fossil fuel production
230112 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
230113 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
230114 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore
230115 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much

230143 were looking at concluding those discussions within the next two weeks and we expect to move forward with an application for antirust immunity within the next two weeks this is a joint venture between us on the transatlantic and i think it will represent significant benefits to consumers particularly in the area of frequent flyer programmes
230144 the landscape has changed out of all recognition to the last time we made an application back in 2000 2001
230145 i think it would be ambitious to expect that to happen by next summer and it certainly wont happen any earlier than that
230146 wed like to think that it will happen as quickly as possible but i think its unlikely that wed get all of the approvals in place by summer 2009
230147 if we can get our application filed before the end of august and as i said our expectation is to finish our discussions and file within the next two weeks its not going to be impacted by presidential elections in the us

230256 ten years after those attacks in kenya and tanzania it appears we have missed the larger lesson of that tragic day and our front line diplomats continue to pay the price as they scramble to respond to the problems of weak states caught up in a vicious and turbulent cycle of collapse they arent the only ones paying the price however as those failed states breed insecurity and conditions favorable for terrorism ten years on the united states still does not have a long term strategy to bring peace and stability to the horn of africa we have tremendous diplomatic military intelligence and foreign assistance resources at our disposal but they are ineffective in the absence of a coordinated and balanced strategy that incorporates both the short and long term goals this is no more evident than in somalia
230257 defeating the terrorist enemy requires a comprehensive effort executed locally nationally regionally and globally working with partner nations we must eliminate terrorist leadership but incarcerating or killing terrorists will not achieve an end to terrorism we must simultaneously eliminate terrorist safe havens tailoring regional strategies to disaggregate terrorist networks and break terrorist financial travel communications and intelligence links finally and most challenging we must address the underlying conditions that terrorists exploit at the national and local levels to induce alienated or aggrieved populations to become sympathizers supporters and ultimately members of terrorist networks we can marginalize violent extremists by addressing peoples needs and grievances by giving people a stake in their own political future and by providing alternatives to what terrorists offer

230405 sherman and tingle have grown their show tremendously in the past year resulting in a great response from our listeners to their highly entertaining content between the songs
230406 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
230407 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
230408 about six to seven percent of comcasts high speed internet subscribers use p2p on a weekly basis
230409 we have never blocked any web sites or any applications as some of the articles have suggested
230410 defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
230411 er steckte sein gep ck in die ablage ber den sitzen er sagte zu niemandem ein wort er wirkte total normal er hatte eine sonnenbrille auf er setzte sich und dann eine halbe stunde sp ter h rten wir diesen schrei der einem das blut in den adern gefrieren lie und drehten uns um
230412 da stand dieser typ stach auf den anderen ein immer wieder immer wieder wie ich wei nicht es muss 40 50 mal gewesen sein in den hals und in die brust w hrend er ihn angriff war er ruhig wie es war als w re er gerade am strand er war total ruhig er sagte nichts da war keine wut oder oder irgendwas er war einfach wie ein roboter der diesen typen niedersticht
230413 er befahl jedem den bus zu verlassen wir verlie en den bus jeder verlie den bus aber einige von uns ich und ein trucker der vorbeikam und einer der greyhound fahrer stiegen wieder ein um zu sehen was passierte und dann sahen wir er hatte den typen auf dem boden er schnitt ihm den kopf ab und war nun ja dabei ihn auszuweiden
230414 der trucker der hatte ein brecheisen und wir rannten wir besorgten uns einen hammer und anderes zeug da versuchten ich und der andere busfahrer die t r zu bewachen stemmten uns mit unseren k rpern gegen die t r und wissen sie warteten darauf dass er rauskommt und so er kehrte zur ck und brachte den kopf nach vorne und zeigte ihn uns und dann lie er ihn vor uns auf den boden fallen sehr ruhig alles sehr ruhig er trug eine sonnenbrille und es wirkte wissen sie als w re es keine gro e sache f r ihn
230415 ruhe in frieden tim mclean du wirst geliebt und innig vermisst werden
230416 ich wusste dass er von einer ausstellung zur ckkehren sollte mein bruder sollte ihn am busbahnhof abholen aber er kam nie an
230417 die kinder werden dich so sehr vermissen ebenso wie william und ich du warst ein gro artiger mensch immer gl cklich geliebt und eine faszinierende pers nlichkeit
230418 heute fordert die kommission comcast auf damit aufzuh ren und jedem uneingeschr nkten zugang zum internet zu gew hren
230419 comcast hat zwar angegeben die willk rlichen blockaden zu beenden aber die konsumenten haben das recht zu wissen dass diese selbstverpflichtung auch juristisch durchgesetzt werden kann
230420 sich in die netzwerk management entscheidungen von breitband providern einmischen
230421 dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden
230422 das wirkt unglaubw rdig nachdem man gestern noch die unabh ngigkeit der schiedskommissionen betont hatte
230423 aber dann h tten beck und andere schon viel eher darauf hinwirken m ssen
230424 ich h tte nie f r m glich gehalten dass das recht auf freie meinungs u erung in der partei willy brandts so gering gesch tzt wird das war undenkbar f r mich
230425 wenn in meiner partei unverantwortliches vertreten und gar in regierungshandeln umgesetzt werden soll betrachte ich es als meine pflicht aus gr nden der solidarit t und solidit t mein wort zu erheben das werde ich auch in zukunft unmissverst ndlich tun
230426 wenn dies tats chlich so kommt und auf der anderen seite jemand wie ich aus der partei geschmissen wird dann ist das ein bild von dem ich kaum glaube dass es der spd zutr glich sein wird
230427 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
230428 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
230429 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
230430 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
230431 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
230432 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
230433 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
230434 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers
230435 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
230436 doesnt know about what yet nor even whod be her collaborator yet it should deal with her being a role model that the number she expects as an advance is in the neighborhood of 2 million
230437 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
230438 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
230439 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
230440 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
230441 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
230442 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
230443 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
230444 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
230445 we started planting when the rains were supposed to come in march but then it never rained so all the seeds rotted
230446 my ox died because i couldnt feed it and now i cant plough this land quick enough to plant more maize i will have to sell everything off to buy food but then i dont know how i will feed everyone after that
230447 were worried what will happen if the rations go down any further
230448 this is the most desperate situation i have ever seen
230449 you can see that many people here are very ill from food shortages those most severely affected children are now getting help but the number of malnourished children is growing all the time and this is a real concern
230450 many babies have already died here and i think many more will die in the months to come not only children but also adults are becoming very weak nobody has anything to eat at all
230451 there have been vast improvements made here especially when you consider that this year we are facing a myriad of problems that is making the situation very difficult to handle
230452 its simple economics people dont have enough money to buy the food they need
230453 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
230454 it is a race against time and time is winning
230455 this is a very difficult time right now and our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends of the brave soldiers and civilian who died
230456 people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
230457 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law

230465 luchar contra el estigma y la discriminaci n hacia las poblaciones m s vulnerables que son tambi n las m s afectadas requiere un enorme esfuerzo de nuestra parte
230466 no solamente porque atentan contra los derechos humanos sino adem s porque le est n haciendo muy pocos favores a la lucha contra la epidemia
230467 el problema es que lo que se haga en prevenci n hoy no dar frutos de inmediato y habitualmente los pol ticos no suelen pensar a largo plazo sino s lo en lo que tiene que ver con su t rmino
230468 para nosotros prevenci n y tratamiento est n muy vinculados
230469 y en el portafolio de estrategias que tenemos que utilizar est n desde los cambios de conducta y el uso amplio de preservativos hasta la b squeda todav a frustrada de microbicidas y vacunas asociado al uso de terapia antirretroviral
230470 estamos a s lo dos a os de 2010 que es cuando se ha comprometido la comunidad internacional a proveer acceso universal a la terapia antirretroviral afirma cahn y todav a estamos muy lejos de eso
230471 this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
230472 every single bus on a regular route will get you to the concert site through transfer stations

230485 does mccain not see that by intervening militarily in foreign countries and by justifying such intervention in terms of supposed universal values america stands in the tradition of imperial powers whose policies and practices have tended to engender the kinds of insurgent movements he fears
230486 it s hard for me to find a european aside from two harvard educated friends in paris who confessed to excitement not just about the visit but the prospect of an obama presidency
230487 def leppard singer joe elliott used his time on stage to fuel the ongoing beef between him and poison drummer rikki rockett and bret michaels just like rikki rockett f ing idiot hes just never seen a good band before elliott said after some technical difficulties

230492 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
230493 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays

230675 swing vote isnt going to be remembered as the best political comedy of our time ivan reitmans wacky but warm dave still holds that position but its not a bad showcase for costner and its heart and brain are both in something close to the right place
230676 the film contains bits of capra esque everyman fantasy and bits of gritty and realistic rural drama but the balance never works out to create a coherent or compelling story its good to see costner doing comedy again but hell need a better vehicle before he stages a real comeback
230677 perhaps the most enjoyment i got out of the entire film was from the over the top political ads run by the two candidates kelsey grammer and dennis hopper as they were forced to flip flop depending on whatever bud said in the media
230678 though there is plenty of humor to be found in costners experiences with newfound celebrity like driving a race car with richard petty or performing with a willie nelson tribute band the real moral of the story has little to do with politics

230724 weve missed it a couple times in the last month as far as the finish but weve had good points in all those races
230725 the next six races are tracks that ive run well at in the past and look forward to going back to them again if things go smooth and we dont have the wrecks and things that can happen in the sport we should have a shot at making the chase
230726 as fast as it was in june during qualifying and the race i think it should be strong a car that can run in the top 10 if we make the right adjustments
230727 i dont see why we cant have a shot at another win as good as it was the first race if we do the right things we should have another shot
230728 i know how kind that place has been to me through the years and we sure could use another good shot of that kindness this weekend

230738 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
230739 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us
230740 we are here having impeachment hearings before the judiciary committee
230741 i never imagined i would ever be sitting on this side when something like this happened
230742 numerous credible allegations of serious misconduct by officials in the bush administration
230743 to the regret of many this is not an impeachment hearing
230744 the most impeachable administration in the history of our country
230745 there is a real question of whether this constitution is being protected
230746 what this congress does or chooses not to do in furthering the investigation of the serious allegations against this administration and if just cause is found to hold them accountable will impact the conduct of future presidents perhaps for generations
230747 there are those who would say that holding this hearing examining whether or not the president and vice president broke the law is frivolous i not only reject this i believe there is no task more important for this congress than to seriously consider whether our nations leaders have violated their oath of office the american public expects no less it is after all their constitution no president or congress has the authority to override that document whereby we the people conferred upon the branches of government limited and defined power and provided for meaningful checks and balances
230748 on january 20 2009 the next president and vice president of the united states will stand before the american people and take an oath of office swearing to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
230749 presidents and vice presidents do not take that oath in a vacuum they are informed by the actions or inactions of past presidents and congresses who establish precedents for the future

230790 ive done my best to provide you with the best possible product and service if youve been happy with the results so far i would very much appreciate a referral could you give me the names of one or two friends or business associates you think could benefit from what i have to offer
230791 mary thanks so much for giving me johns name id like to send him a brief letter to let him know his name came up in our conversation and that id like to help improve his business as i have helped improve yours if i send you the letter to john with a stamped addressed envelope would you write a quick little note to him at the top or in the margin of the letter
230792 due to total quality management empowerment and similar programs corporate america has adopted there are more people involved in the decision making process
230793 at the same time there are actually fewer people who can truly buy value over price as a result there are more obstacles people you might call evaluators to selling value while selling cycles are getting longer and more time intensive
230794 so around the country we hear sales managers say were getting beat on price or our customers are making price based decisions because we havent elevated those value based decisions but that boils down to salespeople selling to the wrong people instead of getting to the person who is empowered to buy value salespeople are selling to product evaluators who get paid to assess product price service and delivery and thats all when youre selling value you want to be face to face with someone who can say yes when everyone else says no those people are the true decision makers
230795 its tougher than ever to sell value today and that leads to point two there are fewer people in organizations who can buy value but a lot more who can buy a commodity number three people who can buy value are located higher up in the corporate structure and four to sell to decision makers located higher up you have to learn whats important to them whats important to a person at a senior level is very different from whats important to the product evaluator who is just trying to get the best price
230796 in this sense understanding your customers business means more than merely evaluating product needs
230797 we narrow down the focus to three core elements first what is the corporate profile and direction where is their business going what are their key issues what are their critical success factors how are they measured what are the things that keep their executives up at night second how is the organization structured both formally and informally of course there is the official corporate structure but beyond that you have to find out how things really get done third who are the key players and what are their profiles you not only have to identify who these important people are but you must also understand what is motivating their decisions and what they are trying to accomplish on a departmental level
230798 but many just dont do it that shows they just dont understand how much you can use information to close sales you use it in interviewing in identifying key players and in presenting to senior management
230799 public data are everything from annual and quarterly reports to 10k reports the d amp b business information report trade journal articles brokerage reports and company newsletters
230800 third we emphasize conducting research meetings in a research meeting you get together with customers or your coaches and place the entire emphasis on working to get to understand their business encourage the customer to do almost all the talking maybe 95 percent they love this part customers are so used to salespeople who talk incessantly when you give the customer a chance to talk about their concerns and plans they really open up its not unusual for customers at the end of a research meeting to say that was the best sales call ive ever experienced they also come to realize that the person asking penetrating questions can become an important resource and thats certainly one critical part of being considered a value provider as opposed to just selling products
230801 salespeople typically spend their time on finding a product fit
230802 but to sell value you have to look beyond the product fit to a strategic business match and as you analyze the information youve gathered look to address the things that are really important to that person who buys value how can you complement the key business strategies of the company how can you help them attain their objectives where are the synergies between your values and their values and underneath that business fit there is a product fit but senior management doesnt care so much about your product they care about what will help them sleep better at night
230803 a client of ours once said to us that being customer focused is a waste of time if your customer doesnt pay you for it
230804 there are lots of ways to gain access but you always leverage your research but remember that you have to get the audience with senior management if you want to sell value accepting anything less is often conceding to selling product and price
230805 talk about all the information at your disposal and how that impacts the customers business you might talk about the profile youve developed characteristics business objectives strategies the issues they deal with the marketplace they work in and some of the tactical challenges they face on a day to day basis
230806 youre not telling them about their business but rather having them confirm what youve learned when they keep nodding as you talk that makes the presentation all the more powerful
230807 now this isnt to say that price is no longer an issue because it always is its just that youve taken price from being a first or second issue and made it into the fifth sixth or tenth most important issue
230808 a lot of times the initial reaction we get from salespeople
230809 is hey i dont have enough time to go to the bathroom let alone think about understanding their business or who i really have to sell to but after theyve spent some time selling this way they find out that this sales process is actually shorter and more efficient
230810 when youre just selling value to the person who can buy value
230811 a lot of salespeople arent comfortable dealing with senior level management
230812 and may not be comfortable listening more than they talk theyve been trained to talk present pitch and close they have a hard time imagining themselves moving beyond the gatekeeper as a result they typically choose to accept the block thats their comfort zone
230813 they relate better to departmental issues as opposed to what makes a senior level decision maker tick they say what do i do when i get there but to sell value you have to relate to these people and weve found that once they implement this step by step strategic process they have a much easier time overcoming these comfort zone issues they do it once and it works and when it works they want to do it again
230814 not only do we know what youre striving for were going to help you get it
230815 i dont think i would have ever used the word
230816 talking between men and women never solves anything where we think they feel they are creatures of the heart

230820 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
230821 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
230822 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
230823 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

230841 meu n o acredito que ela t casando ela virou senhora mas ela t o nova tem a minha idade
230842 i dont know if he swallowed it or if my dogs might have eaten it i dont know
230843 tonight the vietnamese team had a good match the weather tonight was nice and i liked this match very much
230844 im happy with the match although we had little training we would like to thank vietnamese fans and the hosts for giving us a warm welcome and good preparation
230845 its unbelievable to see them playing football in vietnam the vietnamese are like the brazilians in their love for soccer
230846 im very surprised about the warm welcome and the enthusiasm from the vietnamese fans for soccer i will have a lot of things to tell my friends back home
230847 there are many young players who have a lot of experience and i think that will make the difference for us
230848 we have let many chances of gold slip many good teams have played the olympics and we have never managed to win it now we have the opportunity we have a very good team
230849 did i do wrong for being mad at her i know not forgiving is bad is sinful but i know being mad is an emotion that is not wrong but what i did subsequently is a wrong action i do not know
230850 it is a fond memory for all of us who were part of that team but you cant live on past glory
230851 we now want to revive that glory and capture a second olympic title
230852 it will drive us forward and i can promise that we will play our hearts out again
230853 we should definitely be medal contenders but it will be an exceptionally strong tournament
230854 we are confirming that based on our investigation he will not be suspended for conduct that occurred prior to his nfl career
230855 hes been one of the most excited people to be here
230856 hes a happy guy and no matter what you ask him to do whether it is the scout team or special teams whatever it might be hes responded in a positive way to everything
230857 i see a lot of great fighters in this game that only got one opportunity and you worry about that i know theres not too many more opportunities so the one that ive got im going to capitalize off of it
230858 not to downplay joshua clottey but i feel like ive been in the ring with more of the elite fighters more of the best fighters
230859 hes a methodical fighter very one dimensional hes never fought somebody like me
230860 i wait and wait for this fight and finally i have it
230861 its my time to be a champion its not zabs time anymore
230862 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
230863 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
230864 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
230865 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
230866 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
230867 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
230868 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
230869 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
230870 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person
230871 sometimes ill run down the street and jump into the cab with the chinese person and say ok lets go together the chinese person will usually get out of the cab
230872 business is good you just have to learn how they do things
230873 for instance americans are warm and outgoing japanese are hardworking but stingy germans are inflexible but punctual
230874 the stereotypes were formed historically but may change with passing time
230875 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business
230876 ive learned a few simple phrases of english for the products in my store like green tea beer and coke
230877 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record
230878 i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
230879 ive been working out trying to get bigger and faster
230880 i didnt make it to any colleges yet but im going to get down to west virginia sometime soon i dont know the date yet
230881 i want to see west virginias offense what they recruit i think i fit their mold as far as running backs i want to meet the players and check it out
230882 when i start school at the end of august that is when im going to set up officials ill probably narrow it down between now and then
230883 there are a few schools that have what im looking for they are good schools that want me to come in and start as a true freshman i like that but nobody completely sticks out
230884 i can guarantee that youll see us back at state again
230885 i want to get my weight up to 212 pounds this season and keep my speed my goals are to try to get the career record and single season record the career is 7 000 yards and im a bit over 5 000 now i was pretty close last year to the single season mark
230886 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
230887 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
230888 get your fat ass off the sofa stop being such a lazy bitch and inhaling huge amounts of unhealthy foods thin down and be happy

230898 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
230899 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

230902 i have sealed many duct systems by removing the grills registers and using ul 181 duct mastic on all the joints i can reach i then seal everything accessible at the furnace that is accessible most of the time i get to below 6 california code for new ducts without touching anything else if i dont get below 6 then i go to the duct runs that are accessible only very large duct systems and those with ducts buried i cant get below 6 but im usually close i know the person who developed aroseal you have to do some manual work anyway with larger holes grills registers and you will only get as tight as the operator has time to sit around pumping more sealant into the ducts it is a great process for inaccessible duct systems that cant be sealed otherwise

230905 i believe a lot of commercial sdhw applications can make more financial sense than residential applications with the increased economies of scale i have adopted commercial solar dhw as a hobby and would be happy to help anyone with questions
230906 its not that bad but i dont want to push it

230916 im hearing iowa michigan wisconsin penn state ohio state and other big schools that just havent offered
230917 i believe wisconsin and michigan are close to offering im not sure about ohio state and penn state though a lot of schools are really waiting on my first game and see how i do during the season before they make a decision
230918 my top 3 for the schools that have offered me are syracuse iowa and bowling green
230919 the top 3 that have not offered me that louisville ohio state and i really like penn state too
230920 with syracuse i like the dome and that its in new york
230921 with iowa i like its tradition and its winning records bowling green i like how its close by and how it has my major that im majoring in im trying to major in criminal justice
230922 coach ferentz from iowa and i had a conversation with him and he was just explaining a bunch of things to me he made me interested just by having a conversation with him he was telling me what iowa would do for me
230923 one weekend during the season im supposed to go to syracuse
230924 i wanted to commit to a school before my senior season but i didnt get to look at any of my schools so im going to do that during my senior season
230925 im going to decide then and if i cant then ill wait it out until the end ive been to most schools who have offered me except the furthest schools like iowa and syracuse i want to commit to one of bowling green syracuse and iowa but i want to see syracuse first if i dont quite like what i see ill go to iowa

230929 if she did know she never would have auditioned for him
230930 i grew up watching lindsay and it made me want to do what she does
230931 just the whole vibe being there being on camera or onstage with everybody listening to you its so cool when people look up to you
230932 we are three very different people were doing very different things with our lives and we dont step on each others toes
230933 if we all wanted the same thing it wouldnt have worked because thats where all the drama would have started but were like the spice girls im the sporty one we are on different roads and they dont intersect we dont spend time together every day girls just cant do that
230934 i was only 18 when i first moved in and ive grown up so much i really have a new light on my life
230935 ive been thinking a lot about marriage and kids i dont care about going crazy and partying anymore im focused on the real life things my future thats who i am now
230936 my experience was such an awakening but in an amazing way
230937 thank god i never got into an accident im glad it happened the way it did for me god forbid i could have hit or killed someone
230938 ashley and mary kate take readers on a journey through their celebrated young lives pausing to reflect on what has helped shape them into who they are today
230939 they interviewed 20 people and wrote brief essays about each other in each interview the girls explore what inspired the interviewee
230940 we interviewed the people who have inspired us with the hope that they will inspire and teach others
230941 they are going to leave it up until the week before to decide but they can only advise her brit will do her own thing
230942 imagine youre a loner whose ideal home would be a cottage on the beach miles from the nearest neighbor and your ideal day would be one in which you slept from noon to dinnertime worked half the night then split the rest between raising pigeons and walking alone of course on the beach
230943 our forces arrested five wanted suspects in the last few hours
230944 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
230945 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
230946 it would be better to do exercise than to take a pill
230947 people are going beyond their limit their capacity to handle all the stress that is involved in flying and they have become so reliant on flying at the same time that they are very angry
230948 they know what it used to be like and they absolutely dont know what is going to happen next
230949 they just want to give you 10 weeks so you forget about the situation
230950 the fact that we sat in miami with 200 people using the toilet for five hours then we flew for 3 hours that is like a flight to tokyo
230951 we ran out of sanitary supplies and created a danger for the passengers in my opinion
230952 the startling thing to me is as a frequent flier on american is how little they seem to care about it
230953 that said we recognize that we still can control much of whats necessary to provide customers with a satisfactory if not exceptional experience
230954 there are circumstances isolated incidences where passengers have been horribly inconvenienced
230955 but they are by far the exception versus the norm
230956 last week i had to book six flights for myself my husband and my son and i avoided them totally i hope never to fly them again
230957 ive been doing this for 26 years and i have never seen so much thrown at the general public to the point where it becomes an irritation and to the point where it may turn off people
230958 airlines cant keep pace with the rising price of fuel they cant charge the appropriate amount for a ticket to offset those increases so they are having to do things creatively
230959 we are pleased to be working with guestlogix to drive this evolution in broadway theater ticket retailing as tourists account for approximately 600 million in annual broadway ticket sales it is key for us to make it extremely convenient for travelers to secure seats to our popular shows we look forward to working with guestlogix to eventually expand this program to serve venues in las vegas los angeles and chicago
230960 partnering with broadway veteran shubert to expand our in flight merchandising program to include theater tickets presents a significant growth opportunity for guestlogix
230961 north american airlines currently generate less than a dollar in on board sales per passenger trip however with an average transaction price of over 200 selling broadway tickets provides additional ancillary revenue streams and significantly increases revenue per passenger trip by offering new products such as this on board operators can improve passengers travel experience while offsetting rising operating costs and strengthening their bottom line a value proposition which we believe should prove very attractive to any airline operator flying into the new york city area or other u s cities where shubert provides distribution services

230970 pero no puedo decir nada en este momento sobre lo que cada quien podr hacer o no
230971 por lo que le y vi de la propuesta yo no veo todav a condiciones para llegar a ese arreglo
230972 los cohetes sam 7 son los nicos instrumentos que tenemos para defendernos de un ataque a reo que eventualmente a colombia se le ocurriera lanzar en contra de nicaragua
230973 este es un tema que no est resuelto todav a tenemos que estudiar muy bien esa propuesta examinarla muy bien y en su momento vamos a darle respuesta
230974 no me parece la mejor y tampoco las circunstancias de seguridad son las mejores para que nicaragua venga a desarmarse ante la actitud que tiene colombia

230984 it means that the government is protecting us so that we can feel safe to live here
230985 weve always said that youll be deported if you commit felonies thats been the case in the adult system theres been this loophole in the juvenile system that loophole has been closed
230986 san franciscos sanctuary city practices set the stage for the bologna murders
230987 it has been proven that cities with sanctuary laws have safer communities
230988 because immigrant communities feel safer in accessing local law enforcement
230989 when their national call to action produces a dozen people and we have hundreds of people in the streets defending our citys policy
230990 i think its an indication that they will be met with strong opposition in any sanctuary city they go to
230991 so i prefer to stay here with my family and just go out to work go to church and the supermarket
230992 not everyone is bad here there are very good americans who say hi to us and try to integrate us into the community
230993 i prefer to let it roll off my back and not confront them for fear that what happened to my friend will happen to me he was a good person and did not deserve to die like that
230994 personally i dont have problems with any person of another ethnic origin were not all bad
230995 weve never had any kind of problem with anybody they have never broken any glass and on the contrary much of our clientele is anglo saxon

231003 a bottom is not a call for a major thrust toward 14 000 on the dow

231015 we have four airports in london and heathrow is the busiest in the world so it is challenging
231016 we have to close the airports for a period of time
231017 we also liaised with the eleven airlines operating from city so that they could reschedule flights in total 23 flights are affected but we have worked hard to minimise the impact
231018 they understand the complications of the race and there are lots of factors to take into account
231019 if we want to hold the race in london we have no option but to go through this air space they understand that
231020 telescope announces yet another huge voting season with foxs american idol
231021 i said to the uso people im not a musician so i cant sing a song and im not a bombshell so i dont think theyll want to stare at me but if i can id love to speak to them thats what i got a chance to do a lot of them watch heroes

231026 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi
231027 im asking you to regulate it officialize sic it tax it legitimize it
231028 regulating the paparazzi wont bring an end to modern day media coverage just as the newly enforced hands free law hasnt stopped people from talking on cell phones while they drive
231029 its only an adaptive measure put in place to respond to some of the ways that living in a technological free market can compromise personal safety
231030 ole miss has some talent but ive heard several people in the past few days say that 8 or 9 wins is realistic and that powe will win 2 games by himself thats kinda ridiculous im not sure any d lineman in the country is worth a 2 game swing its amazing how high the expectations are for powe amazing i saw some guy post on a message board that now i can get on with my life after powe was cleared
231031 a wife should put on a false smile and overlook all the crockery that her husband throws her way
231032 if you are nice to other people they will be nice to you
231033 there have been a lot of articles and comments and they raised a lot of points and i dont have to rehash every single point everyone ever made before i can add one more comment of my own
231034 in concert with intellectual honesty the 2 examples you cite hardly constitute a scientific poll
231035 as an example for over a year i was married to a nice man i was very nice to him too every erev shabbat he brought me roses and then when he was in a bad mood everything changed and he broke my nose
231036 someday in the not too distant future our culture will come crashing down
231037 someday in the not too distant future we will destroy the ecological balance of our planet rendering it unfriendly to human life
231038 christian beliefs true christian beliefs are based in understanding acceptance protecting what has been given to us jesus was an environmentalist im sure of it
231039 i can produce even more than i am now but i wont because i wont see any of it
231040 i have limited resources and should carefully budget what i have but i wont because when i run out ill just get more handouts
231041 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black

231046 most of the sales to americans are in cash after they take out a second mortgage on a property or mortgage a property they have clear title to
231047 ive only had seven sales that were locally financed in the 15 years ive been here
231048 on the lower end were down at least 50 percent to 60 percent
231049 hemos mantenido y seguimos manteniendo las conversaciones con nuestros aliados de siempre desde el a o 1998 con los cuales en principio no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros
231050 ellos nos han acompa ado a lo largo de todo este proceso iniciado en 1998 antes del triunfo electoral y desde mucho antes nos han acompa ado
231051 pol ticamente no tenemos diferencias lo que pasa es que en la coyuntura electoral considerando que los comicios son un instrumento una instituci n de la democracia liberal y como es la democracia liberal que centra su acci n en la competencia en este sentido las elecciones tienen un efecto normalmente divisor en las sociedades y ese efecto divisor polarizador genera problemas incluso en grupos que son bastante cohesionados tanto desde la perspectiva afectiva como desde la perspectiva pol tica
231052 de manera que en este proceso electoral como ha ocurrido en los anteriores siempre ha habido tensiones entre el movimiento que hoy est organizado en el psuv porque la mayor parte de los cuadros que pertenecieron a esos partidos y muy buena parte de la militancia ahora forman parte del psuv
231053 por esto se ha generado alg n distanciamiento como en otras oportunidades derivadas del deseo de mantener espacios pol ticos en una situaci n donde posiblemente se ha perdido la expectativa de lo que est ocurriendo a nivel mundial en relaci n con la democracia liberal
231054 las instituciones de esa democracia liberal est n en franco decaimiento y por ello es que ha ocurrido la emergencia de muchos l deres que personalmente conocen y tienen una relaci n directa con el pueblo
231055 casi todos los partidos de ese corte que funcionaban dentro de los mecanismos de la democracia liberal han perdido significado
231056 es una carrera contra reloj una vez que la ballena vuelva al agua no podremos controlarla y se dirigir a donde quiera

231081 there are more students taking part in the election this year than any time before

231089 weve been looking around to try and get people for the right areas of the pitch we want to try and improve on
231090 the good thing about madjid is he does play in two positions which is an important factor for us
231091 but were still looking around to maybe add one or two to our squad
231092 its been brilliant i was pleased with the reception i got the other night there was a bit of booing but overall it was good and im over the moon to be here
231093 we are into the competitive games now and its time to go to work
231094 i have always said that once the games start and the fans see the effort i put in then i will win them over and i think wednesday was a big step in that regard
231095 the result could have been better but i felt my performance was ok i gave everything and i hope the fans appreciate that
231096 i felt i really wanted to come back here and play my football here and have the best years of my career
231097 i am here to win medals its the same squad that came so close on four fronts last season and with the new additions who have come in we are stronger
231098 there is the same hunger in the squad the european run last year has only inspired the lads to do the same hopefully this year in the champions league
231099 we realise we have some work to do but we can complete the job
231100 mapa de la comisi n franco siam s de 1907
231101 it was a good game for us to get i feel it can give us an edge going into the second leg with kaunas
231102 we could perhaps have done without a match this weekend but i felt it was an excellent fixture for us to take
231103 we had good matches at home last summer against ajax and chelsea and i felt they set us up for the season that followed
231104 liverpool have got some excellent players available to them and it is a terrific match for us to look forward to
231105 they play good football and in england there are four teams who have stayed at the top of the premiership for a few seasons now
231106 liverpool are obviously one of that group and they have done well in europe recently winning the champions league three seasons ago
231107 i had my testimonial against them a few years back and there was a good crowd at ibrox that night
231108 hopefully theres another decent attendance here this weekend and we give the fans a game to remember
231109 we have to get there first we have our work cut out to make the next round so i dont think its really appropriate to comment
231110 todos los ministros estuvieron de acuerdo que el se or noppadon firmara solo el esquema de un acuerdo antes de que todo el gabinete lo aprobara por lo tanto bajo qu poder se formaliz el acuerdo en mi opini n si el acuerdo fue firmado antes de la aprobaci n del gabinete ese acuerdo es inv lido

231128 we experienced difficulties in the uplift of tickets for wednesdays champions league qualifying match against fc kaunas
231129 we have fully refunded supporters who were most acutely affected by the delays on wednesday and who did not see the game and once again we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused we are extremely grateful for the tremendous interest shown by supporters at the start of the new season which has resulted in our highest ever season ticket sales
231130 this is a good draw for rangers they will be the favourites if the teams meet there is no doubt about that
231131 if the teams played each other 10 times there is no way aalborg would win at least five of those matches
231132 at the same time it would be stupid to think this will be a walkover for rangers because aalborg have a good side
231133 collectively they are a team that works hard with no real superstars in it and that is their big quality
231134 on their day they can compete with a lot of big sides they were unlucky to lose at tottenham last season and with a bit of luck could have had a better result there
231135 aalborg also went through on away goals against sampdoria after drawing 2 2 with them in italy to get to the group stage
231136 if they are on form they are a hard team to beat i would still expect rangers to see off aalborg but they will have to work hard if they are to win overall
231137 curth is a good striker he is not the tallest but he is a dangerous player i think he scored 15 or 16 times last season and has shown a lot of potential
231138 he went abroad to play for feyenoord when he was quite young but is back in denmark now and is making good progress
231139 in midfield thomas augustinussen is one of aalborgs best players too he is very tall and creates a lot of things he holds the team together very well

231142 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior
231143 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur

231170 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
231171 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
231172 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
231173 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
231174 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past
231175 average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0 75 percent at fatalities in iraq will reach 4 300 or more

231177 an increase in potassium with a decrease in sodium is probably the most important dietary choice after weight loss that should be implemented to reduce cardiovascular disease
231178 a high intake of these minerals through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables may improve blood pressure levels and reduce coronary heart disease and stroke
231179 these findings are significant because the national health and nutrition examination survey shows 58 percent of all current drinkers in the united states reported usual alcohol consumption that exceeded the dietary guidelines and 52 percent of all current drinkers reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past year
231180 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
231181 since more than half of current drinkers in our study drank in excess of the dietary guidelines limits and reported binge drinking prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
231182 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking
231183 i couldnt think of any place id rather be today than at church worshipping the lord
231184 when i heard him the other day a few days after it happened the first thought that came to mind is the story of job i was very encouraged and inspired to hear preacher greg maintaining his faith in jesus christ we still believe

231186 tender hearted he grew into a husband and father and into a fine person and individual

231189 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
231190 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
231191 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
231192 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
231193 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
231194 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
231195 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life

231204 is this behavior simply a way to bond or connect in aa meetings analogous to the peace pipe among north american indians or do constituents of these natural compounds result in pharmacological actions that affect the brain
231205 perhaps most interesting is how do these consumatory behaviors affect the brain and what is their role in recovery
231206 if coffee is beneficial to health and cigarettes are harmful to health aa members seem to be going in the right direction by reducing smoking and perhaps increasing their coffee drinking
231207 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forawrd i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times

231228 the overwhelming majority of studies show that people with asthma can exercise safely if medicated appropriately and can significantly improve their cardiovascular fitness and quality of life by doing so
231229 many unnecessarily restricted their childs physical activity because of lack of information or misinterpretation of advice given
231230 exercise induced asthma should be regarded as a marker of poor control and a need to increase fitness rather than as an excuse for inactivity

231237 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability

231241 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
231242 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
231243 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
231244 those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
231245 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
231246 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
231247 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
231248 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
231249 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly

231252 they have to get out as soon as possible or else the case will be heavier and it will be more difficult to get them out
231253 once the case is decided and the court has made a decision it would be hard for them to get out
231254 we dont know in the first place why they have been kept so long we dont know what the charges are
231255 and for protection because we dont know exactly whats happening inside we dont know how theyre being treated
231256 so that means maybe the government has started a mission again against christian activity
231257 theyve started a new strategy probably because it is not just an accident that all this is happening in different cities at the same time they had worked on it before and they planned to move against house churches
231258 this year alone since january we have recorded 35 major incidents of atrocities against the christian community
231259 when we talk of major incidents we do not count minor incidents like cases of harassment beatings attacks on church halls and filing false cases against christian workers
231260 the bjp which is used to segregating masses on religious lines and attacking minorities even physically will do so even more and would like to show hindus that they are the only saviors of hinduism and that if they do not protect the hindus they will all become christians or muslims
231261 if the bjp wins the coming election there is no hope for the minority communities
231262 are a technique to polarize the votes they bjp and affiliates want to threaten the hindu community that christians are going ahead of them
231263 the bjp thinks that by doing this they can consolidate the hindu votes which is not true

231289 its a rotten stubborn directorial endeavor and since cohen has little appreciation for legitimate big screen magic

231291 if you have seen a trailer you have seen it all you just dont know how coincidentally everything fits into the plot
231292 the actors sell the dialogue as capably as they can trying to emulate the snappy lines and easy wit of 1930s romantic comedies or at least classic action films unfortunately the lines are so trite and dumb and unfunny that they elicit puzzlement rather than humor

231304 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman

231352 aboriginal women experience higher rates of violence if that burden is going to be lifted the socioeconomic conditions and prosperity gap between aboriginals and non aboriginals will have to be addressed

231403 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
231404 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
231405 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
231406 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

231453 the seattle based gourmet coffee retailer said in a conference call with analysts that the stores it decided to close were not profitable and that many had opened in the last few years in addition chief financial officer pete bocian said the vast majority were located close to another starbucks store
231454 the problem is that there are limits to growth and if you flood the market with your product eventually the market becomes to saturated to sustain it there is a fine line between convenience and over saturation and starbucks blew past it probably about 600 stores ago if not more even if the economy and the us dollar were sound and things were looking good i doubt starbucks could have avoided this fate aside from there being way too many too close together like in the same mall or across the street from one another starbucks the product has lost its luster and novelty in the eyes of the consumer
231455 but at some point it lost sight of those milano espresso bars and became a victim of its own success
231456 today starbucks sells stuffed animals christmas ornaments and various knickknacks the softly lit sit down stores of its early life share the brand name with mall kiosks and grocery store walk ups next to the produce department
231457 its no longer an escape destination its everywhere and it no longer provides a predictable consistent experience one starbucks offers lounge chairs and jazz another is nestled between a jewelry store and pretzel shop at the mall
231458 businesses must grow to prosper but somewhere along the line starbucks felt as if the white paper cup with the green label could go anywhere and do anything
231459 later i walked around michigan avenue confronting people asking them if i gave them 5 for breakfast and they had a choice between dunkin donuts and starbucks which would they choose

231463 wsj what advice would you give someone starting out in your field
231464 mr quek the f amp b industry is a very tough business so you have to be really passionate about it and be willing to start from the bottom a solid foundation is necessary before being able to excel and stay with it
231465 wsj is it hard to balance your pursuit for aesthetics and the bottom line
231466 mr quek if you pursue perfection for its own sake then its just for show if you just pursue the bottom line and not quality then you cannot compete the trick is being able to stretch your dollar for example getting 1 000 value from spending 800

231472 however it appears that for at least the next five years and possibly longer the saudis are likely to produce less crude than promised according to fresh data on the kingdoms oil fields obtained july 9 by businessweek
231473 but the detailed document obtained from a person with access to saudi oil officials suggests that saudi aramco will be limited to sustained production of just 12 million barrels a day in 2010 and will be able to maintain that volume only for short temporary periods such as emergencies
231474 the government last month announced a similar p4 billion package aimed at mitigating the impact of soaring fuel prices it included p2 billion in subsidies for lifeline power users equivalent to a p500 cash grant for those using 100 kilowatt hours or less per month p1 billion for scholarships and student loans and a p1 billion credit facility for the conversion of public utility vehicle engines to make them run on alternative fuels
231475 longtime market observers cautioned that the turnaround may not signal a lasting shift in sentiment prices have swung violently in recent days as they flirted with record highs but it does underscore investor uncertainty about the sustainability of sky high prices and their potentially long lasting effects on the broader economy
231476 government is supporting these oil price hikes because the bureau of internal revenue is collecting more money from vat imagine vat collections from fuel has reached 80 billion pesos already the more these giant oil companies hike those prices the more government goes happy all straight to the bank

231538 i knew two other people who had gone through the program and i went on their web site to research the course
231539 the program taught us how to resource information in order to help other people garden especially in the area of growing food they teach us about pest control fertilizers seeds plants every aspect of gardening

231550 from the positioning of mr wicks body and the angle at which the first shot was fired it would have been impossible for the officer to notice a gun in mr wicks right hand
231551 we have filed some paperwork pursuant to the california state evidence code that requires the police audiotape be released in full our own final forensic and dna reports will be completed in 60 days to verify if indeed mr wicks had in his possession a firearm in his hand at the time of his death

231558 these tragedies are a cause of great concern police officers are sworn to protect and serve but unfortunately many community residents have lost confidence in the inglewood police department
231559 we need to have a thorough outside investigation to understand what is happening and to take the appropriate steps to correct the situation

231866 go into the kitchen and heat up some broth alice should have left some you should know where
231867 no its for that friar goodness knows what hes been doing suppose hes been looking round the town he looks wore out poor devil or i should say poor man
231868 are you all right emily ill never cope tomorrow if you get ill god knows ive had to face too much illness under my roof you can rest once youve taken the broth up if you like ill close early
231869 i was afraid id put you to some trouble to make it
231870 its the broth mister harry keeps for the ale drinkers when they fall asleep on his floor it fills their bellies so he can send them home i think its because hes sorry for them but he still takes a penny off their masters now and again for it
231871 i suppose the townsmen will want to see you in the morning
231872 bailiff eadred has already seen me this evening hes just left
231873 we can dry your robes for you if you want
231874 i can stand a little cold besides i must be off to the inquest before light but thank you
231875 as i said eadred came to see me he seemed upset that i had been to the castle and that i was not to go there again except on a direct invitation from lord william or his lady
231876 what happened to the clothiers emily why are all their stalls empty
231877 a lot of them died of the pestilence it seemed to get into the cloth
231878 every town ive passed through on my way here could tell some tale about one or other of its trades the clothiers didnt all die of the death did they
231879 some people said that the death followed the cloth around but no one could say for sure if it was true all the clothiers have shut up shop and all their weavers and shearers have been coming to the town to get other work but they werent sure what was going on either mister harry said thered be a proclamation from mayor masters and the bailiffs or the castle people would come in and start causing trouble again but nothing like thats happened
231880 i dont know its all just whispering my brother heard a lot of it while he was helping to dig the pits
231881 i found something once some church treasure that had been stolen that no one else could find i found it using the ideas of a heretic
231882 his name was william of ockham and he died of the pestilence in italy i used an idea of his it might sound ordinary to you he said that we shouldnt look for puzzles when we couldnt answer questions where there were many possible answers we should choose the most simple one that fitted everything in the question he was using reason that part of what he said isnt heresy emily
231883 yes but dont become a spy emily thats devils work
231884 im not a brother from the house on the brook nor one from trentham
231885 im a visitor here i didnt know that there were such rules about who could pray where in newcastle
231886 ive just come from the castle but im a guest of the townsmen ill go if you want but i only wanted to pray
231887 the castle the castle they have their own place to pray and much good may it do them the castle overlooks the town but we dont want it to see everything pray with the castle men if you want
231888 that all the arms of the church cannot be in harmony at this time of all times
231889 he is in the town spreading his death to other towns
231890 pray if you must but pray with your brothers or with the castle men theres much praying to be done
231891 we recognize that every drivers situation is different and that some people will achieve a return on the extra investment of a hybrid car much faster than others
231892 drivers near major cities often have a wide range of commute distances which means that the break even point can be dramatically different from one person to the next
231893 for example if a houston area commuter travels 12 miles one way to work driving 10 000 total miles annually while a los angeles area commuter travels 25 miles one way driving 15 000 total miles annually the los angeles commuter recoups his investment almost 80 percent faster
231894 consumers who are thinking of purchasing a hybrid car solely to save money on gas should calculate the number of miles they drive per year and their typical per gallon gas price to make an educated decision

231896 it was bright bright enough that it illuminated the ground
231897 it went behind a hill and i waited to see if i could hear it crash because as big as it was it was bound to make noise
231898 it seemed like it was some kind of surveillance vehicle four wheel drive it had government plates u s government plates and behind it were a couple of vans that looked like support vehicles
231899 these guys staring you down had a men in black feel to it
231900 it was about the size of a semi trailer he says oblong shaped thing
231901 the fact that there were people here the next day it was almost like they were doing some sort of cleanup or whatever the point is something definitely happened

231905 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
231906 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
231907 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
231908 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
231909 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
231910 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
231911 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
231912 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
231913 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
231914 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
231915 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
231916 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

231922 well there is some preliminary research now actually looking at this very issue and since the human genome has been mapped now people have been looking at the genome for all sorts of excuses if you will for different things and this may be yet another one of them
231923 but the real question here i think is can genetics somehow explain why some people are more likely to benefit from exercise than other people and i think theres some real value there to possibly exploring that a little bit further
231924 there are clearly people who you sort of look enviously over even as theyre opening twinkies they seem to build pecs but there are other people no matter how much exercise they do they dont seem to lose an inch
231925 yeah i took the little lady out to see the poopdog last week

231927 how the heck are you going to build an economy or a business only if the sun is shining what you really need to do is when the sun is shining figure out how to store some of that energy so you can unleash it when the sun isnt shining

231930 over the past 12 months the number of unemployed persons has increased by 1 6 million and the unemployment rate has risen by 1 0 percentage point
231931 the number of unemployed persons who had lost their last job has risen by 778 000 over the year
231932 remember too that the official unemployment rate understates the severity of the downturn as it doesnt count formerly full time employees now working part time
231933 the number of people now who are either unemployed or underemployed is surely larger than it has been for many many years
231934 it probably feels like a recession for many americans particularly those looking for a job
231935 this is not to say that people regardless of age are not struggling to keep and find jobs

231962 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years

231983 you are disowning everything frank marshall davis wrote who cares about the use of the term mentor look in any dictionary you are quibbling about terms that mean the same no matter who uses them how come you havent taken issue with the editor of the books john edgar tidwell and the publishers university of wisconsin press and university press of mississippi i think you should contact the editor and publishers and have them either stand behind what has been written or disown it as you are fully aware if you have ever read either of the two books the only thing i have done is quote the books and say the same thing the editor has stated
231984 if there is one thing frank marshall davis makes clear is that he had the utmost respect for communists because of the way communists fight for the rights of working people and against racism frank marshall davis was entitled to his political views there is no doubt he joined the ranks of members of the communist party usa along with his very good friends benjamin davis and paul robeson for you to deny this is cowardly shameful and disgusting
231985 after calling the publishers of daviss books they said they never heard from anyone in the family upset with anything in the books nor is the family contesting anything in the books
231986 i have had leanings in that direction i e marxism since i was in college
231987 this was of course consistent with the line of the communist party during the soviet nazi alliance against national defense
231988 about november 1950 the communist party in hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis in the new organization party groups were to consist of not more than three members groups were identified by numbers 1 10 rather than by names as formerly
231989 we find that there is no substance to these claims
231990 i would suggest that you take up your concerns with barack obama who first brought frank marshall davis to our attention
231991 it was the dsa chapter that adopted me in chicago that got us food found me a place to live and so i want to thank you 35 years later for what you did for me and for what you did for farm workers because i think thanks to that help we were successful and we did stop the sale of grapes and we did build a farm workers union

231995 stanley told me he was so destroyed that he took a 4 month leave from look magazine
231996 it is to evoke memories of the wonderful yet turbulent 1960s which was a critical time in american history

231998 folk music was kind of used as a voice to express against the system or what is societys norms
231999 reggae music has been used in that same way to express the struggle of the people
232000 the folk music definition has changed in this fast music world and musical styles are blending really quickly
232001 it is forward thinking and open minded of the newport festival to embrace different styles
232002 i would hesitate necessarily to call it a folk festival anymore
232003 i dont think you last this long unless you are continually helping artists supporting artists who take risks
232004 this festival has always been known as a place for artists to take chances
232005 we cant just think of folk music as a songwriter sitting behind a guitar or piano singing original songs all night
232006 its not a scholarly academic festival its not like a university funded and organized anthropological festival of folk music in the purist sense it never has been
232007 positively fourth street the lives and times of joan baez bob dylan mimi baez farina and richard farina
232008 new research published this week has revealed that one in three women who attempt to take their own lives have been the victims of domestic violence
232009 a separate report issued by the united nations committee for the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women cedaw expressed deep concern about a number of related issues included human trafficking sexual violence and the level of services for female prisoners here
232010 cedaw has called for more support and services for vulnerable women and i would like to echo that call
232011 i would also point out that the policing board is currently taking an in depth investigation of domestic violence and the psnis approach to it
232012 in 2007 08 the police responded to 23076 domestic violence incidents that is more than the level of all other criminal activity combined
232013 that is a shocking statistic and is also the reason why the board is determined to take a robust approach to this issue by forensically examining all levels of the psnis response including prevention and protection investigation and arrest support for victims the role of public protection units and inter agency co operation
232014 i welcome the new measure to ensure that all new housing developments include an assessment of required educational facilities and provisions for schools to be built
232015 however it will mean little unless funds for the provision of schools are released by the department of education this measure will only act to identify future school needs in new developments unless investment in school buildings is forthcoming
232016 the biggest obstacle to the building of schools is the departments refusal to release funds
232017 at a time of economic downturn education is not an area were we can afford to cut spending
232018 provided by the market through rental of floor space rather than from the capital programme as proposed in the ndp
232019 clear commitments were given by government to develop modern primary care facilities as the cornerstone of a transformed health service
232020 it would appear that this is being done to make short term so called savings

232044 last week i had the honor of participating in a portrait unveiling ceremony for former new jersey representative mary norton who was a tireless advocate for equal pay she understood that the wage gap is not just a womens issue it is a family issue
232045 when women earn less for equal work families are forced to do more with less affording all of lifes expenses is challenging enough it should not be made harder as a result of women being short changed on payday
232046 while i continue to oppose the decision to close fort monmouth and pursue ways to reverse it we should plan to meet the medical needs of the many veterans and tricare beneficiaries in central new jersey
232047 this report would be a step toward accomplishing that goal
232048 electronic voting notoriously can lead to disputes and uncertainties while many states have set in place requirements for a paper ballot or record for every vote cast we need to do more we also need to give states the resources to conduct audits to insure that vote totals and paper ballots match
232049 t he widespread adoption of voter verifiable paper records does not resolve the security reliability and verifiability issues with electronic voting paper records will not prevent programming errors software bugs or the introduction of malicious software into voting systems if paper is to have any real security value it must be used to check or audit the voting systems electronic records

232067 the crime has signs of premeditation he called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body
232068 he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban
232069 yet to show any remorse for what he has done

232075 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
232076 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
232077 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
232078 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
232079 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
232080 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
232081 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
232082 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
232083 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
232084 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
232085 when you see something as horrifying as that the brain locks on to those images its very difficult to release those images
232086 the assistance that people will get will be along the lines of coping in the immediate phase learning what to do to reduce the profound effect this experience will have
232087 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
232088 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
232089 we are working with transport canada to review inter city bus security

232092 this news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the iraqi biological weapons program is very significant partly because theres been a lot of pressure on the bush administration inside and out to go after saddam hussein and some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun

232096 repeatedly expressed concern to ivins that she may have been exposed to anthrax spores when handling powder
232097 if this is from the daschle powder it could be re aerosolized and somebody could get hurt really bad if its from ordinary culture its not that dangerous
232098 im not convinced i know the source of the contamination
232099 the message here from a scientific and policy standpoint is profound
232100 facilities that are medical and microbiological may not be suitably equipped for dealing with aerosolized versions of the organisms that they otherwise deal with in great safety these facilities probably ought not be located in a heavily populated area how do you contain smoke
232101 the chance that theyll be working in the same rushed atmosphere they faced at fort detrick is very small
232102 any defense lawyer should read this report carefully and keep it in mind when dna results are being quoted against his or her client

232149 i knew we needed to make some changes and its easier to make changes if we get input from outside impartial sources
232150 this audit and this meeting are not to point out good things it is to find the truth about needed changes problems that have developed over a long period of time even before i became superintendent they are not unique to williamsburg either
232151 if people think the problems are my fault whatever the public needs to know
232152 hey boss i want to work as randomly as ossibly ok

232156 we are deeply convinced that authorship knowing who wrote what helps readers trust the content

232161 i am thomas paine come again i am paul reveres horse i am lincoln by the reflecting pool and now i am awake i am the people as myself coming up out of a dream to renew the music of my mind
232162 what am i doing and why am i doing it what do i believe and why do i believe it
232163 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there
232164 obviously effort wise he is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
232165 our goal has always been for cardsshoppe customers to not only access all our creative and unique invitations announcements and cards available by secure convenient and personalized shopping through the internet but also come and visit us and view our products personally after a management decision we are moving to 200 production drive lafayette la in the wal mart shopping center

232171 the best way of making them is to take up some of the metall molten glass out of the pot upon the end of an iron rod and immediately let it drop into cold water and there lye till it cool
232172 discriminatory and not narrowly tailored to address comcasts concern about network congestion
232173 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
232174 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast was doing with their subscribers internet traffic
232175 we are gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine and that the deadline established in the order is the same self imposed deadline that we announced four months ago
232176 on the other hand we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
232177 the fact is the fcc does not know what comcast did and did not do
232178 ironically todays decision may result in slow speeds for 95 percent of internet users
232179 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking that communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
232180 if id had this document prior to the 2007 shipping season
232181 i would have known exactly what we were dealing with
232182 the herald has apologized to reilly for the unauthorized use of his work
232183 we also apologize to our readers and promise to do everything possible to prevent this kind of failure in the future
232184 eight years after starting work on this im very excited to see the first data
232185 i think it will help all of us to better protect our health and clean up our waters
232186 these tools are tested and i think our people for the most part use them extremely judiciously
232187 oregon pesticide use shows similarities with what neighboring california has been finding through their reporting system
232188 one years data is interesting but we hope the reports collected this year and in the future will help provide a more clear picture of trends in oregons pesticide use
232189 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
232190 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
232191 that is why we are talking to pakistan thats why we are carrying on these conversations
232192 its a jigsaw puzzle we have some of the pieces the pieces that we have i told you where they lead
232193 if the berlin wall can fall so can these troubles that we have that are keeping us apart
232194 weve lost huge proportions of what was formerly the trail in the park its disappeared gone
232195 were not as worried about the flash flooding as we are about the instability of the ground and the slumping and the cracks appearing all along that entire 60 km length of the trail
232196 weve had lots of hard rain in the south part of baffin island in the last five days so we dont know what this is doing to further destabilize melting permafrost because this is what is causing the erosion
232197 people are curious about how a band like us not the obvious band would immediately get a phone call from a big american record producer and i think it has definitely had an impact on the way people have regarded us
232198 theres only one ive finished up to now its a slightly hillbilly sounding song actually but yeah wes anderson s doing this thing for fantastic mr fox its like a model animation you know so kind of old fashioned
232199 its good to have side projects but its like a wheel i think
232200 this small bedroom project then somehow managed to gain the attention of my record company who wanted to hear what i had been doing
232201 after lots of eerrrrs and aarrrgghs i sheepishly took them my music to listen to i was shocked when they said they wanted to release the whole album
232202 one thing lead to another and they the record company finally after many phone calls and emails decided that they wouldnt release it very confusing
232203 so i set about trying to release it myself spending lots of time researching phoning mailing it was a challenge very tiring but hugely rewarding and educational
232204 i made a mistake the suitcase was supposed to fall in the river if it had fallen in the river nobody would have found it as they havent found the head and the other parts

232215 the reason we discovered this is because they were on the job they look for it
232216 every day computers in university systems are subject to constant battering from external sources who are trying to get in security is a constant issue
232217 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
232218 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
232219 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
232220 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as
232221 ha naruto thats not what you told me when we were in bed
232222 lets never mention this again ok now if you dont mind i have to get to my locker

232231 weve been building shopping centres for 50 years and have opened in all sorts of economic circumstances
232232 the essential point is that we are long term investors
232233 we dont take a lot of notice of these short term fluctuations we like the fundamentals of london its one of the worlds great destinations it has above average growth in uk retail sales and like elsewhere in the uk it is undersupplied by high quality retail space

232239 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months

232242 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
232243 the importance of the national library is that its a repository of all written and recorded documentation relating to our country in a way the national library is a repository of south africas memory
232244 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
232245 hours cut is a big deal people still have a job but they are losing income
232246 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
232247 first you see hours get short and eventually more people will get laid off
232248 that is the piece i find missing from the job search process most people tend to think just because theyre good at something they should be employed in that field if youre good at numbers be an accountant right no not necessarily
232249 few of us can accurately gauge how we will feel tomorrow or next week thats why when you go to the supermarket on an empty stomach youll buy too much and if you shop after a big meal youll buy too little
232250 out of abject poverty and into the middle class but that it does little to increase happiness thereafter
232251 we know that its significantly more important than money and somewhat more important than health thats what the data shows the interesting thing is that people will sacrifice social relationships to get other things that wont make them as happy money thats what i mean when i say people should do wise shopping for happiness
232252 everyone has heard that money doesnt buy happiness but we seem to forget that
232253 from my experiences the majority of students are looking for a major that will provide them with a solid foundation in a subject that interests them gen y knows from an early age that they will have many jobs and many careers therefore picking a highly technical major to prepare you for a specific career does not make much sense thats what grad school is for if you go that route
232254 young adults can pick careers that interest them and are fulfilling if that career happens to have a high pay out great if not theres plenty of time left to worry about money after you try a career you really want to do
232255 when womens pay is significantly greater than mens it can be in male dominated fields female dominated fields or well integrated fields
232256 the average man would rather be sold to by a woman than by a man
232257 whenever people break traditional roles the people who do the role breaking tend to be highly motivated and good they make more because they are so good and because people like going to a woman because its a novelty
232258 add to this the fact that top level executive males would prefer to be presented to by a woman than by a man and also that female financial analysts are in shorter supply and you have a blend of characteristics that are likely to make a female financial analyst on average more valued
232259 put in the hours people who work 44 hours per week make twice as much as those working 34 hours thats 33 percent more work for 100 percent more pay which makes it cost efficient to hire out cleaning errands etc
232260 women as a rule dont work as many hours because their obligations tend to be more divided they like to fulfill their home obligations and second they tend to work less in the evenings and on weekends and tend to move less for jobs
232261 39 fields in which women earn at least 5 more than men
232262 focus on helping others first with their networking objectives and youll reap a better return on your own networking
232263 in every story ive written on the topic high power execs have sung their praises but all have said theyre only as powerful as i make them
232264 its a negative perspective i change it its who knows you and knows what you know
232265 i believe if you are able to word something the right way politely humbly you can ask for what you want even if it means messaging someone random on facebook its worked for me more than once
232266 online networking is a great launchpad for connecting with many people it has added speed and efficiency to our everyday business doings i will always prefer the face to face contact however the statement just get me the meeting comes to mind theres nothing like actually meeting the real person behind the profile
232267 it really helps me to visualize the person im contacting and so often you can see a picture of someone or some aspect of their lives that you can glean a piece of information from
232268 though i dont mention that i looked up their profile i think it reflects a bit in the confidence of my approach
232269 create a great profile in the online social network that you get invited to join most frequently if you get a lot of linkedin invites it is likely that your personal network can be found there if you hear from a lot of friends on facebook that is the place for you
232270 i feel like a quintessential element of building a profile online is having a site or blog to reference in all of your profiles and activities on the social web
232271 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
232272 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
232273 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied
232274 a lot of younger women looked up to her shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over so id say paris is infamous
232275 i dont think that makes paris and me similar i dont go to clubs i dont party i dont dance on tables and i dont like sex tapes
232276 50 best small and medium companies to work for in america
232277 were actually given the business reason for concrete proof that what were doing makes a big difference with the company
232278 the employees have a lot of valuable input about how to do things better and the company seeks that out so much
232279 put technical stuff aside and look at how to be the best for your team being able to give work directly with employees to get the best out of them

232285 i swear by the site and encourage my friends and colleagues to get connected on the site ive expanded both my personal and professional networks as a result of linkedin com and have been extremely successful in connecting others who may not have had previous knowledge of each other using the site
232286 i think a lot of people dont understand what linkedin is or the power it has for them it costs nothing to join at the basic level
232287 a lot of younger people tend to not think it through they write a lot of stuff on a blog or facebook but they dont understand that everything online is visible
232288 see if theres a group you want to join or if not start a great way to network join alumni groups theyre a great way to stay in touch
232289 the more you show your expertise the better you look to prospective employers

232293 the success of saudi inspired religious zealotry in europe was in large part because the saudis put up the money to build mosques and pay for imams
232294 the american muslim community was rich enough not to require saudi money to build its mosques

232298 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
232299 the way laura has chosen to handle the situation publicly is really disappointing
232300 i hope her heart will at some point recognize the comment was not personal highly emotional and certainly never meant to be heard over the air i have made myself available to her but she has chosen not to talk scream at me or whatever else she feels she needs to do for her peace of mind
232301 fema was instructed by a law congress passed and was signed by the president to make and implement a plan for housing disaster victims
232302 but instead fema has just passed the responsibilities under its jurisdiction off to an unformed body im trying to figure out why these pages are blank
232303 the strategy is in fact a strategy its a precursor to a plan
232304 the senate today sent the president a bill with one of the most significant provisions to jumpstarting our recovery since hurricanes katrina and rita devastated the gulf coast in 2005
232305 our homeowners will now get the tax relief they need to reinvest in their homes and our communities
232306 it is well established that the government is only liable in such situations if it supervised and directed day to day activities of its contractors which did not occur in this case
232307 ive always thought that each of us as an individual should make our own decisions
232308 i think it is unfortunate that so often in modern society we tend to try to group people by stereotypes and hyphenated identifications

232336 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
232337 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
232338 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
232339 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that
232340 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed

232348 home game will be played in toronto as buffalo looks to expand its fan base and cash flow success on the field ultimately will hinge on quarterback play and injuries jaurons master plan was sidetracked by the disappointing play in 07 of quarterback j p losman that put the ball in the hands of rookie trent edwards who enters this season with the pressure and expectations of a starter already handed the job not a third round draft pick nobody expected to make an impact the bills drafted 65

232425 weve been shouting this from the rooftops for years now given the situation in afghanistan there is growing frustration within the u s about pakistans two timing but theres no telling whether this is a one off scolding or will translate into longer term action hopefully there will be more trouble for the isi ahead

232520 2008 convergence conference the future of latin entertainment media and technology markets
232521 we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with estrogen but by enabling them to use the estrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
232522 we discovered that you can affect the estrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where its needed to address memory and spatial learning
232523 estrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
232524 we wanted to come back and enhance the signaling pathway that makes estrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signaling pathway solely in the brain
232525 this research shows that when the estrogen receptor alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
232526 this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two estrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly estrogen receptor alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organization and function
232527 investigating the impact of genetically replacing the estrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioral levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of estrogen receptor alpha in mediating estrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
232528 from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the estrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
232529 the research brings up the idea that local activation of non nuclear estrogen receptor alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus
232530 forced millions from their homes and in particular claimed the lives of tens of thousands
232531 ronald reagan would have never gone to the olympics i guarantee you that never gone
232532 will go down in history as cooperating in the genocide olympics of 2008
232533 i am not the least bit shy of bringing up the concerns expressed by this factory worker and i believe that ill have an opportunity to do so with the president and at the same time enjoy a great sporting event
232534 there is no greater spokesman for human rights in the world than our president
232535 the sudanese governments recent attacks take us back to the very darkest days of the conflict
232536 the security council shouldnt stand by as though this is
232537 the councils inaction has given sudan a green light to continue attacking civilian targets flouting international law and security council resolutions
232538 these horrific attacks on civilians show khartoums confidence that there will be no real consequences for its actions its time for the security council to prove them wrong
232539 darfur is the focus of international attention and many western nations want china to play a bigger role
232540 this is why i have been appointed as the special envoy of the chinese government on the darfur issue
232541 since last may i have visited sudan four times in the future if it is necessary i will pay more visits
232542 we have a good relationship with sudan we have some advantages in talking to sudan so we should use this as leverage we will persuade them in a direct way to work with the international community and be more cooperative
232543 as for the olympic games any advice or comments even if it contains misunderstandings or criticism we are open to and welcome this advice
232544 we are willing to listen to any comments that contain reasonable elements but for those few who attempt to tarnish the olympic games on the pretext of issues totally unrelated to the olympics like the darfur issue we are firmly opposed to such attempts
232545 since my birth ive never seen planes bombing like this there were no warning signs the attack would come
232546 we were able to bring nothing with us some people were lucky and had time to gather food but i brought nothing out apart from my children
232547 most refugees are in a state of shock especially those still unable to trace family members from darfur
232548 let us shout out in one voice stop the killing
232549 wei jingsheng is the best known chinese human rights and democracy fighter and is the leader for the opposition against the chinese communist dictatorship
232550 courage to stand alone letters from prison and other writings
232551 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
232552 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
232553 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
232554 rolling out the hybrid peacekeeping operation and resolving the darfur issue require the joint efforts of all sides
232555 first the sudan government should cooperate better with the international community and demonstrate greater flexibility on some technical issues next anti government organisations in the darfur region should return to the negotiating table
232556 in the political process several months have passed without substantive progress
232557 should use their own influence to work on all the sides
232558 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
232559 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
232560 this is deeply concerning and we are making every effort with the chadian authorities to get these refugees moved quickly
232561 women report being raped children have been separated from their families
232562 it is because of them that we have the problems we have today
232563 they gave no reason for their actions but it was clear the relocation would not take place
232564 trying to find a solution to this problem which is leaving the refugees extremely exposed and vulnerable
232565 the area is highly insecure with roaming armed groups posing a real threat to the refugees and aid workers
232566 its up to him i am going to the olympics i view the olympics as a sporting event
232567 i do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in darfur
232568 there are a lot of issues that i suspect people are going to opine about during the olympics the dalai lama crowd youve got the global warming folks you got darfur
232569 i am not going to go and use the olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the chinese people in a public way because i do it all the time with the president
232570 i was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in america who care deeply about the issue once you make that decision you have to rely upon an international organisation like the united nations to provide the oomph
232571 it is a decision i am now living with and it is a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world
232572 it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti nazi underground could have received an education raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country
232573 defined by courage optimism and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family
232574 the world is running out of patience over whats going in darfur
232575 not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them
232576 to link the darfur issue to the olympics is a move to politicize the olympics and this is inconsistent with the olympics spirit and will bear no fruit
232577 all i can say is that they were school age
232578 people are fighting each other and trying to drive them out of the area we have to evacuate people
232579 the government is doing this to try to influence mediation efforts
232580 after stealing the elections from kenyans kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace
232581 what is really happening is a continuation of the ethnic cleansing that railas people are doing to kill the presidents people
232582 for the umpteenth time we again ask president kibaki and orange democratic movement leader mr raila odinga to work for peace truth and justice
232583 the necessary weapons and ammunition to exterminate the african tribes in darfur
232584 they shoved a guard and tried to force a gate and behaved in a very rude way
232585 my heart our hearts are breaking for what happened in cambodia today especially for the survivors of genocide
232586 our goal today was to deliver these flowers in deepest respect to honor those who have perished here in cambodia and in darfur and in all genocides everywhere
232587 why dont they just go to china to do that
232588 its pretty harsh to be against a ceremony that honors the victims of darfur and genocide survivors everywhere
232589 our resolve is still the same which is to go forward
232590 its really difficult how anyone can be against honoring survivors of genocide particularly as cambodians
232591 we do not want to see any trouble or confrontation with them said touch naroth the police chief for cambodias capital phnom penh but we simply cannot let this group breach the law either
232592 the olympic games are not a political issue therefore we wont allow any rally to light a torch
232593 we will not support the activity we will not allow them to politicise the olympic games
232594 the symbolic olympic torch relay is urging the chinese government as both olympic host and sudans strongest political and economic partner to use its special influence with the sudanese government
232595 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life

232599 well our costs our x so well charge consumers x 1000 and make 1000 per consumer
232600 dan amp danica had a question on this a few weeks ago i read a few posts from people who were upset young women were being charged more for health insurance than young men how much would that chasm grow with mandatory birth control coverage im all for it im just curious what the costs would be
232601 the insurance company should cover this the insurance company should cover that
232602 i cant believe you wont let her go on birth control
232603 well i understand that it really hurts the guy to pee but its not like its deadly besides if insurance companies cover prostate medication because a few men want it then it will make everyones premiums go up regardless if they even have prostate issues
232604 viagra is something that middle aged or elderly men use to screw their trophy wives and or mistresses this is of vast importance ed can kill just like blue balls birth control is something sluts use to screw around without suffering the consequences women are sluts make them pay for their slut pills

232608 an insurance company can do whatever the heck they want to do as they see fit to run their business as any other corporation sees fit to run their business
232609 the law requires insurers that sell residential property insurance in california to offer earthquake coverage to their policyholders residential property insurance includes coverage for homeowners condominium owners mobilehome owners and renters

232612 i suppose you can always look for ways you can cynically claim victim status if you want
232613 i get annoyed with guys that walk around butt naked as if everybody enjoys the view if the view is good i dont mind but if its ugly why does everybody have to see the dangling fats

232655 one night there was this band three girls and a guy playing named rosehips
232656 they were really really good the sound kind of grabbed me it was a little bit more complicated than i thought it would be it kind of had a bit of the early 90s feel that i liked
232657 so after the show i talked to the band and it just so happened they were looking for a female bass player at the time
232658 i think a lot of people might say look an all female group
232659 but it was different for me when i saw them play for the first time i was like theyre cute but gosh they can really play well too sometimes people dont really expect that
232660 our label is called pillow fight records and i think thats pretty accurate it hits you hard but it doesnt really hurt
232661 there is some overlap but i think november loop is a little bit more shoegaze
232662 i think both of them have roots in the early to mid 90s sound but in different ways november loop took it more of the slow dive galaxy 500 route and rosehips is more of the smashing pumpkins its a little bit more rock
232663 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
232664 what ive come to see is that completing something no matter how large or how small puts you into harmony with the universe

232669 i know that after dealing with if and now being an adoptive mom at times i feel like my decisions are being second guessed or the choices ive made regarding creating a family are being judged
232670 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
232671 some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america
232672 this is a realistic opportunity we are excited and hopeful that this is going to be a successful operation
232673 operation scheduled departure is an admission that immigration raids are ravaging communities and wasting taxpayer dollars

232687 both candidates are going to work very hard to get their supporters out
232688 i would think that funkhouser has enough to do with the city without getting involved in these state rep races
232689 im not gong to pull my horns in and get all cautious because i think i have things to do

232693 well over the past 50 years members of congress have been convicted of at least 16 different felonies including fraud conspiracy racketeering extortion drug possession one member was even convicted of manslaughter
232694 former congressman bill janklow a democrat from south dakota was convicted of striking and killing a motorcyclist with his car in 2003 he was sentenced to 100 days in prison
232695 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules we are not going to let this decision get in the way of our mission which is to deliver a budget that reflects the values of californians
232696 now one of the bright new stars in the republican party has suddenly become tarnished the state legislature this week voted to hire an independent investigator to see whether ms palin abused her office by trying to get her former brother in law fired from his job as an alaska state trooper

232698 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
232699 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly

232701 the next washington bureau chief of the ap must preserve the authority and standards we have spent 160 years building while at the same time leading us into a new and rapidly changing world of journalism
232702 there are few places in all of journalism more respected or closely watched than the washington bureau of the associated press and there are few moments in history when the aps coverage of washington has mattered more
232703 the whole world really is watching washington and american politics
232704 we just dont want people eating and buying this food would you want your kids to buy the food if theyre walking by the park i wouldnt want to buy it i get sick sometimes when i go to a regular restaurant
232705 but if you want to call it that maybe its a food suppression operation
232706 you know some chipmunks would go so nicely right there
232707 to get the right mechanism for resolving disputes is perhaps the most difficult part
232708 if the anglican communion declines into legalism we will have lost something vital about the life of the anglican communion
232709 therefore the covenant process is about trying to strike a balance
232710 it doesnt cease to be an anglican body but lives in a different way
232711 those churches that were prepared to take this covenant on as an expression of their responsibility to each other would limit their local freedoms for the sake of a wider witness some might not be willing to do this we could arrive at a situation where there were constituent churches in the anglican communion and other churches in association which were bound by historic and perhaps personal links fed from many of the same sources but not bound in a single and unrestricted sacramental communion and not sharing the same constitutional structures
232712 will be writing to all those bishops who are absent
232713 meet them yourselves talk to them tell them your concerns and then make a decision
232714 the autonomy of each church while at the same time
232715 the consequences and commitments that flow from being able to work together
232716 our overall aim is to hold the anglican communion together
232717 an overwhelming consensus on the need to uphold the communion
232718 we need to discover each other become friends you do not fear friends
232719 not to penalize and put people in a state of fear
232720 we were not inclined to give detailed consideration to consequences

232722 bonds horse illustrates just how tough this game can be the horse was purchased for 120 000 at the 2005 keeneland september sale and here she is on sale for 25 000 probably with no takers as its pretty rare for anyone to claim out of this bottom maiden claiming level the owner im sure has more than 200 000 in her including training van and vet costs
232723 what he doesnt have in his head he makes up for in his
232724 he was charged with first degree murder felony murder by aggravated battery on a child whos under the age of 12
232725 they didnt have a lot of different issues to go over they basically had one question which was when did these injuries occur and i think they spent all their time on that one issue
232726 but as with most sentences life doesnt necessarily come without the chance of parole in first degree murder the first ten years of a sentence the prisoner is not eligible for probation or parole the judge has the option during sentencing to set a higher minimum
232727 there is really no pleasure in it its my job to get this done but the guilty verdict is causing even more pain for the grove family who are innocent bystanders in this situation and i get no pleasure out of that whatsoever

232731 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
232732 im just saying that were still working through it and i havent received any recommendations yet from the chiefs of the military services or from the central command commander
232733 the numbers are not significant at most a couple of hundred maybe
232734 though the situation is serious and the commanders need additional troops there is not the sense in this building among military planners among the civilian leadership that the situation is desperate precarious or urgent it is an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed

232739 this memorial is a fitting tribute honoring the 52 lives lost on 7 july 2005 ensuring that the world will never forget them
232740 we would like to thank the department for culture media and sport and the royal parks for their support throughout this project
232741 we are proud to have had the opportunity to help the bereaved families of the 7 july london bombings create a fitting memorial to their loved ones by working in close and constant consultation with them and the wider design team we have designed something that fulfills their brief to us to create a memorial that allows for a collective experience as well as being a place of relative quiet for contemplation for the families and the wider public
232742 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for lost victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of a curious visitor
232743 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
232744 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
232745 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
232746 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
232747 if i were the user id expect it to work like

232751 the air yeezy is inspired by kanyes love for high top designer shoes drafting from the collar molding seen in the air jordan v and featuring a thin midfoot strap hardly meant for support while originally conceptualized atop a dunk midsole the final version of the yeezy features the familiar shared tooling from the jordan iii and air revolution which most recently was also featured on jordan brands spizike and a lesser known model that deservedly flew under the radar the flight 48 its also the bulkiness of the shoes tongue that stands out most with west always opting to pop the tongue and leave the waxed laces loosely tied an ode to his tour the models outsole also actually glows in the dark as similar to a common glow stick if the shoe is held near light the familiar green glowing hue will radiate afterwards out from under the shoe this black glow colorway features a ridiculously high quality full grain leather along the heel quarter with rich suede making up the toe and midfoot overlays and patent leather highlighting the dominant midfoot strap
232752 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
232753 it was pretty much the same with the last record
232754 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
232755 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
232756 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
232757 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
232758 local solutions has been actively involved in many local grassroots campaigns in the past and is currently engaged in the upcoming november election for humboldt county 2nd district supervisor their innovative resources can be developed further to better serve future campaigns but only with your help please consider supporting local solutions with a donation
232759 this anniversary is more than a sad reminder of the lives lost and irrevocably altered one year ago its also a reminder of how strong our community really is we will never forget the stories of minnesotans rushing towards the danger into the water to save their neighbors in the days following the tragedy we made a firm commitment to rebuild and forming over the mississippi river every day we see the results of that commitment for franni and me this day will always be marked with solemn remembrance of what we have lost and also a deep appreciation for what we retain and what we can build together
232760 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
232761 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
232762 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
232763 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
232764 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
232765 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
232766 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
232767 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
232768 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
232769 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
232770 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
232771 it all started early one saturday morning a week before my daughters fifth birthday
232772 there are 1 972 first names in the bible and do you know why that is because you cant tell the story of god with out telling the stories of the people who participate with god
232773 been excommunicated from a christian book store cheated on by his wife and who had tried to commit suicide
232774 feels more alive when he pushes his own limits and relies on a love that is greater than his own
232775 we were looking for a place to sit when we saw some people looking at something
232776 we joked that maybe it was something from plum island
232777 its a dog its satan people cant stop talking about it
232778 the once robust figure covered with soft and pettable fur was witnesses noted with dread utterly absent its coat save the occasional individual strand sticking out as if it had been skinned by an evil tormentor
232779 or looking at the picture we thought it could be a raccoon that was skinned and has its upper jaw missing
232780 the legs appear to be too long in proportion to the body
232781 rodents have two huge curved incisor teeth in front of their mouths
232782 a dog or coyote that was diseased and has been in the sea for a while
232783 a guy took it and put it in the woods in his backyard he has a big backyard
232784 the buyout part didnt surprise everyone it is the sale that has really thrown everyone because even if it is a negotiating tactic it is on the table
232785 i thought it was going to be something less than this
232786 this turned out to be much much worse that the paper is up for sale that is a punch in the gut
232787 im ready im ready were going to see tomorrow night i guess
232788 theyre very big because we have to continue to get better every day every practice every game that we play in to prepare ourselves for the olympics
232789 so theyre very important its a significant amount of time that we need to use in these games and practices to help us get better for the olympics
232790 um no thats normal for training camp it takes a lot longer for an offensive line to pick up all the different blitzes that a def brings offense is just that much more complicated they are all new together but all those guys have played for a lot of years in the nfl this isnt their first time around the block they all know the different defenses they play so i think theyve got some really good players that can gel pretty quickly
232791 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
232792 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
232793 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
232794 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
232795 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
232796 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
232797 satisfy your sweet tooth with free chocolate and confection samples
232798 i figured hed get plunked for his little bat flip in his last at bat when he homered off of todd jones
232799 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
232800 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
232801 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
232802 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
232803 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
232804 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
232805 ricky davis is now an la clipper finishing at last his 8 or 9 year journey to his true destiny
232806 at first i picked him up because i hate flies always have and i was grossed out by seeing the flies buzzing around his little face he was only a month old
232807 i just needed to help him get the flies away
232808 ive wanted to adopt a child all of my life
232809 i just didnt know how or when it would happen
232810 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
232811 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
232812 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
232813 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
232814 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
232815 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
232816 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
232817 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
232818 wanna go up to 4700m in a van and then ride a bicycle downhill 64km on the most dangerous road in the world
232819 ahem no do i look like i have a death wish
232820 we are anarchists for we do not run into elections
232821 hey look at me now im hot eh kinda and successful eh kinda and people love me okay that part is totally true
232822 hey i liked barbara a lot and id like to thank her for treating me like a human even though she was popular
232823 oh karen was so nice i hope she has a great life now
232824 you sneaky bastards youre manipulating the dumb and malleable unwashed masses that should legitimately be mine
232825 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
232826 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
232827 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners from foreclosure with barack obama for better gas mileage
232828 and when president bush tried to cut medicaid the oregon health plan i said no
232829 ive often said its not john kerrys fault that he looks french but it is his fault that he wants to pursue policies that have us act like the french
232830 a comparison of lam mpi and mpich messaging calls with cluster computing
232831 distributed programs often must deal with heterogeneous environments network links of varying latencies and unpredictable failures in the network or the computers
232832 software techniques for shared cache multi core systems intel software network
232833 a high number of clusters have 64 nodes or less almost no clusters have between 64 and 256 nodes then above 256 the number increases
232834 a comparison of lam mpi and mpich messaging calls with cluster computing
232835 but at the end of the day its better if the world can see who i am and that the choices that ive made are reflected because ultimately the choices that ive made in life on balance represent me and for most of us thats a good thing
232836 im facing my imminent demise and im still an atheist religion gives me no comfort
232837 a hippy camp that existed during the seventies and has been completely untouched ever since the result a laidback rural romance which perfectly compliments the new season collection
232838 this is a very difficult time right now and our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends of the brave soldiers and civilian who died

232940 acho que o cruzeiro tem dois jovens jogadores que o caso do fabinho que agora passa por cirurgia e vai ficar parado por um per odo longo e o jaj um atacante novo eu acho que o cruzeiro carente de atacante para uma competi o dessa independente de vir a ter que sair algum jogador ou n o
232941 hoje voc trazer um jogador do n vel do fran a do n vel do lu s fabiano invi vel para a maioria dos clubes brasileiros
232942 o ciro uma surpresa pra voc s pra n s n o ele est sendo trabalhado h algum tempo mas n s tivemos um cuidado grande com ele na fisiologia na nutri o para que ele ganhe algo a mais para ser um atleta de alto n vel tecnicamente ele sabe ainda falta muita coisa mas ele sabe ousado voc s viram e vai poder nos ajudar bastante

233062 no ser el nico ahorro porque al disponer de locales vac os podremos hacer una valoraci n global de los ahorros que nos suponen en todo tipo de prestaci n de servicios estamos contando con el asesoramiento de una empresa cualificada y estamos estudiando la circulaci n de papeles para ver qu servicios se ponen pr ximos y cu les ser n los mejores espacios para albergar cada funci n
233063 hasta que no est terminada toda la instalaci n en el seminario no procederemos a mover un funcionario
233064 un buen ejemplo de un edificio que se tendr que estudiar qu se hace con l y ser una de las decisiones que se habr de tomar as como de los locales de plaza roma es un conjunto de decisiones que se deben tomar de forma r pida para que en septiembre empiece todo el proceso
233065 you can really feel the particulate stuff getting into your lungs
233066 after the race when we tried to talk or laugh or cough it was pretty tough you could feel it in your lungs there was a burning
233067 trying to cheer was almost impossible because we just couldnt take deep breaths
233068 there may be some risk for outdoor events that include minimum one hour continuous physical efforts at high level
233069 its going to be the toughest on those athletes because theyre going to be out there breathing hard for the longest amount of time
233070 its going to have its biggest effect on those with an underlying lung disease like asthma or those who have allergic rhinitis that would be triggered by the smoggy air
233071 certainly those athletes are going to be at a disadvantage and thats just going to be a fact of life
233072 so im just trying to take inventory of when that gets to be bad and when that is fairly good
233073 ive tried my different asthma medicines and my different allergy medicines and im trying to find the perfect combination that helps me breathe the best
233074 i think scientifically weve done everything possible and will continue up until games time and through games time to make it the best possible for athletes and visitors
233075 we are confident that because of those extra measures the air quality will be good for the athletes during the games time
233076 two days of rather impressive blue sky its been beautiful outside and you just take it one day at a time
233077 there has definitely been an improvement in the air quality
233078 the beijing government calls days here with good air quality blue sky days
233079 sometimes its hard to tell looking at the sky today theres only a suggestion of blue peeking through the haze and the clouds
233080 the benefits of the masks are as much psychological as they are physiological
233081 whether or not these devices are necessary is something we wont know until were actually in beijing at the games were optimistic that the air will be of a suitable standard but we are prepared in the event that we encounter conditions that are somewhat less than ideal
233082 i think of pollution as one of many factors that i need to deal with during the race
233083 most of my planning is going to be focused on simply getting used to the time zone change and getting used to the heat and the humidity
233084 those are things i feel i have better control over
233085 keith is a big athlete who likes physical play and has a strong will to win
233086 in turkey he was selected to the leagues all defensive team and always guarded the other teams top scorer i am sure that in frankfurt he will continue to improve and will help us a great deal
233087 its like a horror movie the attack of the killer lobsters the most un kosher creature on earth is about to feast upon the most kosher
233088 the bible says god drove adam and eve out of the garden of eden in a fury
233089 pursue your enemies with your tempest and terrify them with your storm
233090 the roar of moses triumph is heard in the hills
233091 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
233092 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
233093 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player we can squash that one
233094 congress shouldnt take a vacation until we vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
233095 mucho m s importante como consecuencia de las actuaciones en el r o porque han provocado la situaci n actual
233096 la zona del iceberg por ejemplo hay que limpiarla cuando termine la expo y en el puente del tercer milenio siguen existiendo obst culos cuando se limpien todas las islas que se han generado el r o se comportar de forma normal
233097 y eso ya es un lago que permite hacer actividades deportivas de forma regular
233098 estamos haciendo lo que dice el pgou y las actuaciones que se est n desarrollando en estos momentos son propuestas que se hizo al bie bureau international des expositions
233099 para el d a que lleguen los barcos que espero que sea de forma inmediata
233100 s lo falta que los barcos con su motor empiecen a surcar porque ya se ha procedido a la limpieza del r o
233101 la reforma en el r o beneficia a la ciudad
233102 la limpieza del r o est terminada y en cualquier caso falta la autorizaci n de un motor auxiliar por razones de seguridad y que se utilice cuando sea necesario
233103 los barcos de una forma natural no han llegado a la expo y creo que podr n llegar de forma inmediata pero no me atrevo a decir una fecha
233104 hay que cumplir y a partir de ah la empresa concesionaria tiene la obligaci n de cumplir las normas y las ordenanzas
233105 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record
233106 i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
233107 our visit was during the heat of summer my mother wants to see the land in bloom and although professors don t get vacations in april i m already planning a way to carve out five or six days to take her there

233120 come amos perdendo para a nig ria por 2 a 0 no campo deles depois vencemos dentro de casa perdemos fora e empatamos em casa claro que n o aquilo que gostar amos que fosse realmente n o estamos bem pontuados mas se for olhar o que foi produzido isso me d esperan a os jogadores absorveram bem a chegada de um novo treinador em um espa o muito curto de tempo

233122 ela tem um ingl s mais puro que o meu converso direto com os jogadores no treino s assim a gente vai ter uma melhora mas para trazer mais facilidade para a imprensa ela me auxilia muito bem porque fala um ingl s excepcional ela uma garota promissora muito inteligente filha de um grande amigo meu que foi meu jogador campe o comigo e que eu tenho o maior respeito que foi o tita ela tem me ajudado bastante e eu agrade o muito a ela
233123 aquilo foi uma coisa que eu coloquei no dia que n s vencemos me perguntaram como eu estava me sentindo eu falei que estava querendo ir para casa fazer uma banheira levar uma massagem que eles me bateram demais eu n o pensava que aqui batiam tanto est o batendo tanto quanto aqui no rio mas estou acostumado quem trabalha em flamengo vasco botafogo fluminense corinthians internacional bahia vit ria guarani e vai por a afora est acostumado a esse tipo de situa o foi s uma coloca o para animar um pouco o ambiente

233130 we are displeased with this report and while the economy is not as strong as we would like we are encouraged that the overall economy seems to be doing slightly better as the gdp report showed yesterday
233131 i think you could fairly call this a mixed report as wages rose by 3 4 percent over the last 12 months
233132 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
233133 i think the president is not inclined to move forward on a second stimulus package right now
233134 we are already seeing a positive impact on the economy but the additional benefits from it and the data that well see from it arent going to come for a little while
233135 i remember everything i remember it being sunny and hot i had my window down
233136 the next thing i knew the concrete started to wave in front of me
233137 the bridge pulled apart in front of me and i went sliding
233138 i said i will not die on that bridge i am not going to die today
233139 this is not the way i am going to go
233140 when i hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient that scares me and i think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very very important and should be a welcome trend in the united states
233141 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken
233142 it is time for a new a different and a better approach
233143 we are looking at mileage based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel we are looking at private sector investments
233144 you would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses yet this was one they failed to accurately assess it was like a meteor falling to the ground
233145 i say how did we get money for stadiums how did we get money for all these new stadiums were building
233146 whats more important baseball or safe traveling should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now
233147 our goal was to educate decision and policymakers across the nation of the importance of louisianas coastal erosion problems that it affects the entire nation

233165 tobacco producers and their families will be able to bring closure to what has been a very stressful time
233166 this program is available to help producers exit the industry transition to other crops or find new opportunities outside agriculture
233167 the unique challenges tobacco farmers are facing have never come with easy solutions
233168 as you know farming is a business but its also a proud way of life that goes back generations these funds will help those who wish to continue to produce to do so under a new provincial licensing system
233169 to help communities transition to a non tobacco based economy
233170 in a phone call with the player he spoke about his views on football and what role he would like to see arshavin fulfil at the club
233171 ramos gave andrei a key position in his team and arshavin was very pleased
233172 secondly tottenham are the only club who met the terms of andreis personal contract
233173 and they offered zenit virtually all the money which the club wants for the player
233174 this might be achieved by moderate sunbed exposure during the winter
233175 according to the estimations of giovannucci and co workers this would reduce the total number of cancer deaths by 29 percent in the united states corresponding to a reduction of the annual number of cancer deaths in norway by 3 000 from the total level of 11 000 this reduction is more than 10 times the number of cutaneous malignant melanoma cmm deaths in norway which is about 250 per year taking into account that moderate and regular sunbed exposure in the winter might not necessarily lead to any increase in the number of cmm deaths one should reconsider the restrictive attitude towards sunbed use

233186 theres a time and place for everything and its called college
233187 we wont let them take a single cent from us we also have poor people
233188 first they should distribute to us the portion that they confiscated and later the central government should assign the poorest provinces part of the other 50 percent of the money left in its coffers
233189 because these non renewable resources belong to the entire country not to just one region and it is not acceptable for one part to be getting rich when a majority of peruvians continue to live in absolute poverty
233190 these are areas that also need some kind of economic compensation to spend on public works that enable them to develop when the company no longer operates in the zone

233202 there are not a lot of idaho locust trees around so its sad to lose them
233203 the idaho locust was thought to be resistant to the black locust borer
233204 in the mid 1980s the insect devastated black locust trees but the idaho locust had only minor infestations now we are concerned that the insect might be making a resurgence
233205 the greatest threat to our street trees is a lack of water
233206 we plant a diversity of trees so we dont have a large population of a single species that may become susceptible to a new insect or disease

233212 oh no heather not a rose everyone has a rose what about a daisy
233213 religion and poetry are akin because each is marked by a pure reserve a kind of modesty or reverence to follow nature sensitively you need to follow her unveiling part of herself you are led upwards from beauty to beauty quietly and serenely step by step with no sudden leap from depths to height beauty is shy is not like a man rushing out in front of a crowd religion too if it is wise models itself upon the ways of scripture where the treasure of truth is hidden from the idle and unread to be seen on when eye of the mind is pure

233260 she wont mind the ground she likes good ground but a shower of rain would not do her any harm
233261 she has done really well to come back henry has done a brilliant job with her
233262 she is a genuine group one filly and hopefully she will run well tomorrow she wouldnt want the ground too firm but it should be ok
233263 its richard hills view that she will appreciate the step up in trip he even said that when she won at newbury
233264 tomorrow will be a good time to find out whether he is correct or not
233265 she may be fresher than most she hasnt been as busy but we need to see if he is right in his assessment that she wants 10 furlongs and there is every chance she does
233266 there was talk of her running over a mile and a half but there isnt much in her pedigree to suggest that she wants that far
233267 any ease in the ground certainly wouldnt harm her chances

233355 we had a pretty simple philosophy work hard and work each day you have a little plan and you work to achieve the goal
233356 offensively we have as good a group of skilled players as we have seen we have a chance to be better defensively we have eight starters back and you inject sam nina sinkam back into the mix and we have the opportunity to be good
233357 i think we have a chance to be very good we also have a chance to be average depth is a problem as it is for many teams but our goals are the same every year compete for a league title and advance to the championship tournament
233358 we have a very talented player at quarterback john skelton and we have a lot of weapons around him we return four of five starters on the offensive line the kicking game will be a big issue for us
233359 we are going to play a better brand of football we are bigger stronger and more experienced we are starting to see big dividends in recruiting and we have a lot more seniors now sophomores and juniors that have played a lot over the last two years
233360 much like a coach randolph is never satisfied until hes doing everything perfectly hes just one of those driven players
233361 we have to have some guys step up our defensive line has to step up if we have that we have a defense that can be as good or better than last year
233362 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her shes doing a great job
233363 we consider this incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference conference usa office and the ncaa with the information

233365 we consider this gt incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference gt conference usa office and the ncaa with the information
233366 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
233367 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
233368 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested

233375 it will be a great to tribute to our mother the late janet kramm as a school teacher
233376 we expect smart sales will come in between 24 000 and 27 500 during 2008
233377 some of the biggest names in music have become part of our ambassadors of rock program over the last three years from the who the
233378 we are also proud to partner with vh1 save the and continue to show support for music education
233379 i was going to a fathers wake i never met the man but she is a wonderful woman and i was going to support her i generally leave work at 5 or 5 15 on average
233380 it takes time to process everything and thats what created me leaving the building later half hour 45 minutes later than i normally would have
233381 i went from the best moment of my professional career to the worst moment of my life
233382 i heard a loud boom the bridge moved lateral it dropped a little i just assumed that a barge had run into a beam in the water
233383 seconds after the north end which i was heading towards buckled up to 40 50 feet in the air slab by slab coming at me and all the rest of us we were actually moving sideways and thats when i thought it was an earthquake
233384 grabbed my cell phone basically i called my wife to say basically say goodbye i just assumed that was it
233385 kim kim im on the bridge it collapsed people are in the water people are screaming we need help call 911
233386 taking 15 minutes to do a 2 minute job taking literally a half hour to figure out something that takes 5 or 10 minutes losing focus the position i had was up on the ninth floor so being up high and not trusting things to stay in place i still had that feeling of dropping and that was hard because i had to take time to go outside to get my bearings and composure
233387 meeting took place in the office the subject was how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
233388 if you get the right incident the american public will support
233389 usually its some kid or some drunk who pulled the fire alarm but then i looked out the window
233390 we had to run down 14 flights of stairs to get out
233391 it made us a little panicky once we started smelling the smoke
233392 we were lucky that it was during a very slow period
233393 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
233394 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
233395 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
233396 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
233397 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
233398 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
233399 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
233400 before making an application default on we require a few things access to the sites structured data through semantic markup or a data feed a well designed and broadly useful application and positive user metrics
233401 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage we started with yelp linkedin and yahoo local because they were among our first partners to share structured data
233402 our tests uncovered that users found these apps useful in fact in some cases we saw a lift in click through rate of as high as 15 percent
233403 cbs like all media companies is facing stiff head winds from an advertising downturn
233404 top line advertising revenue was soft across all of its major business units and especially so in radio
233405 we are clearly challenged by the economic conditions affecting many industries particularly as it pertains to our local businesses
233406 but this is kind of the wrong time and the wrong place for a sale
233407 have a boyfriend right now i go on dates and have crushes and stuff though
233408 right now i think this is the last season i go through phases when ive been filming where i wake up in the middle of the night and i think im being filmed thats when i have to take a vacation
233409 sometimes you have a feeling you made a difference in peoples lives
233410 sometimes you have a criminal with a serious addiction you get them on a path to turn their life around
233411 theres a certain appeal where you dont have to bounce the kids back and forth
233412 it can work for a while both parents have access to the kids on an equal basis it resolves a problem
233413 people want a final decision on custody and they want to stick to their position
233414 theres more complexity in the rules you have to follow all of it goes in protecting peoples rights which is a good thing
233415 i think its a wonderful way to cap a career in law
233416 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
233417 it is a race against time and time is winning
233418 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
233419 let us demand that the president of the united states call a special session of this congress on energy
233420 beat the heat with dcs best local ice cream at the dog day farmers market on
233421 we will be bringing the following flavors gelato keswick creamery lemon ricotta cardamom blue ridge dairy mascarpone valrhona chocolate amargo dark chocolate gelato pistacchio di bronte sicilian pistacchio dulce de leche sorbetto lime cilantro cilantro from gardeners gourmet lemon opal basil opal basil from gardeners gourmet toigo orchards yellow peach bourbon toigo orchards plum whatever plum is available westmoreland berry farm raspberry westmoreland berry farm blackberry toigo orchards sour cherry plus some surprises depending on what we find at the markets this week
233422 the industry and the people who do dietary risk assessments in companies could not be more upset by this
233423 if the program had the support of the industry the agencies the public and nongovernmental organizations who did want to cut it
233424 unless we get additional funding from usda or congress the programs not coming back
233425 not to disrupt ongoing market analysis reporting and to notify the committee in advance of any termination of other ongoing nass activities
233426 we can get a better feel for whether growers are moving away from high risk compounds
233427 the loss of this survey will leave a lot of unanswered questions
233428 we depend on these data for helping to interpret our water quality results
233429 what we really need is something like the california system nationwide with complete reporting from the point of use instead of a survey
233430 its the cadillac of pesticide use data in the country
233431 i will update my 2000 report on pesticide use soon and it will be a lot harder for me to do it without nass data
233432 without nass data all the policy issues and debates that have been going on for the last 15 or 20 years over pesticide use would be based largely on speculation
233433 we have discussed with usda the need for such reliable publicly available data but at the same time we are exploring alternative sources of information to ensure we can continue to provide robust pesticide risk assessments
233434 we meant that the current surveys are taken for granted users are not demanding more and have been quietly going about their business of using the nass surveys for the past 17 years
233435 no one was shaking the table saying dont touch this if youre a bureaucrat and no ones shaking the table you ignore them
233436 new york like most states is now facing an unenviable choice either taxes have to be raised or expenditures cut
233437 when faced with such an unpleasant choice economic theory and evidence gives a clear and unambiguous answer it is economically preferable to raise taxes on those with high incomes than to cut state expenditures
233438 i read about it and i thought a lot of people wont agree with this but i say why not we pay taxes to help those who need it
233439 i think its a great idea if you are looking to force rich people to move to states like florida
233440 in times of financial distress the rich get hurt also
233441 im not sure about how capcom in general feels but its not doing as well as i would like in the us at retail
233442 marketing on the title has actually been rather significant especially through vehicles brought to us by partners like nvidia dell and intel the game has been shown at events all over the world in their booths at tons of computing events especially in asia multiple media tours theres an upcoming promotion with dell etc
233443 dont take the praise or the blame seriously it leads to an easier life
233444 ac hay una responsabilidad paraguaya al no haberse terminado todas las obras que se debieron haber hecho y no se hicieron pero tambi n hay una responsabilidad binacional en haber permitido subir la cota sin haberse terminado todas las obras
233445 fue bien recibido dijeron que tienen tambi n sus problemas y necesidades pero que est n abiertos a discutir porque consideran leg timo nuestro reclamo
233446 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
233447 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
233448 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
233449 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
233450 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
233451 i used to make my own websites and sell them but then i realised hey this is much easier than making them
233452 its as simple as buying a website from someone and making it more attractive its about creating value where there was none
233453 google docs is a free web based word processor spreadsheet and presentation application offered by google it allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real time with other users google docs combines the features of two services writely and spreadsheets which were merged into a single product on october 10 2006 a third product for presentations incorporating technology designed by tonic systems was released on september 17 2007
233454 san jose state university is in the early stages of using google apps education edition currently only faculty and staff are given access we hope to include students at a later time when technical challenges around associating student email addresses with google apps is resolved
233455 the point is that 401 k and similar contribution plans were created to ensure that people would have adequate savings for retirement not as a source of credit to use casually
233456 these debit cards allow a participant to use his or her retirement savings to make everyday purchases like buying a cup of coffee clearly thats not what the 401 k is for
233457 most people dont realize it but youre paying back the loan with after tax income
233458 angie gave me the power to not care what people thought of me
233459 she always just wanted to be who she was and that was female and to be loved
233460 a lot of times transwomen specifically transwomen of color are targeted for multiple reasons regarding various identities transgender identity being one of them
233461 a hate crime like this serves to intimidate and disrupt an entire community
233462 no one should ever live their lives in fear and intimidation regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity
233463 what is indisputable is that a beautiful teenager who was loved by her family and her friends was beaten with a fire extinguisher by someone who thought he was somehow justified in doing so angie wasnt killed because she was lying to him she wasnt killed because she had a secret she was killed because we live in a society that doesnt teach not to kill
233464 he took a part of our heart he did when he killed her
233465 he took a part that will never never get replaced
233466 this is modeled after stuff these guys do every day for a living that might be part of why we havent drawn the huge sponsor money and tv coverage
233467 the climbing competition is the flashiest part of the business but its the smallest part arboriculture is mostly folks doing estimates looking for bugs or doing proposals to city councils for funding
233468 theres lumberjacks and then theres the hippie tree huggers these folks are somewhere in the middle
233469 im probably up a tree leave a message and ill get back to you
233470 does pretty much everything to do with trees except well pretty much everything
233471 sometimes you get two guys set up side by side in two trees
233472 then its always a contest to see who gets to the top first thats inevitable
233473 we could have been out of there a long time ago
233474 and in a much better position as a nation both in terms of our economy and national security if we had done this earlier
233475 now just about everyones on board except for basically george bush dick cheney and john mccain
233476 even maliki who has resisted this even though the iraqi parliament and people of iraq have wanted it for a long time is now saying this is the best choice
233477 the vehicles would stretch from denver watching them drive by at 30 miles per hour would take 75 days experts estimate the removal of all personnel and equipment could take as long as 20 months
233478 many people lost many of their beloveds they cannot take it anymore
233479 but its not the turning point that people think were at
233480 i think were either past or right at the point where if we dont make a transition to iraq function ing on its own its going to lose its ability to do so
233481 a lot of times getting people to work together is much easier to do at that local level than it is at the national level
233482 trying to drive this thing by trying to get a national reconciliation that would then feed down to the local level is pretty much counter to how most processes work
233483 that would rekindle the violence in a very short time
233484 now i will have sunni militias integrated into the security forces and then they will come to revenge the shias who killed them
233485 thats what it is and no matter what country welcomes help at some point to deal with a problem nobody wants that occupying power to stay forever or for a very long period of time so the resentment has always been there and the danger is that if we dont indicate a clear intention of when were going to leave so the people can look at that that resentment will grow again and cause serious problems
233486 if you stay longer were going to have more violence more battles
233487 people will adjust to the political reality of how you gain power and use power in an occupation instead of adjusting to a new status quo that will be created when the transition is completed
233488 we want people to work for iraq not work ing for their sects
233489 boy this writing is really good but let me show you a little more about structure
233490 lets go take a drive around nashville ive got a car out here
233491 tom you gotta stop trying to be me and start being yourself
233492 ive lived in other states where midwifery was legal and legitimate and was advertised in the yellow pages
233493 i dont want it to be a culture of fear
233494 theres never been a midwife listed in the st louis market before
233495 choosing to deliver a baby at home is to place the process of giving birth over the goal of having a healthy baby
233496 i dont know if youve looked into the requirements of what the lay midwives have to achieve to be certified its laughable
233497 there are women in hospital where the situation changes in minutes
233498 membranes rupture and umbilical cords collapse it doesnt take too long before that winds up in a disaster or death
233499 i know they said the doctors arent going to be liable
233500 you tell the plaintiffs attorney that they drop the problem off at your doorstep and if youre on call youre it
233501 as far as the legal system is concerned i would do it all
233502 people who think this is a willy nilly choice please read the extant literature
233503 homebirth places the process of birth over the goal of a healthy baby
233504 in theory you could not graduate highschool and still be a midwife
233505 for example in missouri lay midwife bills get introduced year after year these bills have been stopped up to now mainly by deft political maneuvering and hardball tactics employed by the state medical society not by any persuasive testimony about comparative safety or quality of care
233506 shes the girl who doesnt take shit the girl thats gonna walk into the room and she might not be the tallest thinnest prettiest or perfectly put together but she looks the sexiest and most confident because she exudes that hey im a badass attitude
233507 she goes against the grain sometimes and shes just a lil bit edgy a lil bit tougher but at the same time she isnt a bitch and she isnt a whore
233508 i wrote a whole song about the power of role playing sex im a came about because my boyfriend at the time and i fell into a bit of a rut sexually so i tried to introduce some role playing after a couple of nights of this he said terri im not a pirate im not a burglar im just a guy i just like guy things great if you notice in the song all he says in the chorus is im a man im a man im a man boooorrrriinnnngg im all kinds of things a bitch geisha blue movie goddess virgin fuck you im interesting he laughed at the song and we did eventually try some more fun scenes in bed
233509 when we wake up in the morning we can either choose to plug in to the creative source or to plug in to a chaotic force if you dont consciously choose this then you will be drawn into chaos before lunch and youll have no idea how you got there energy follows intention i wake up i take the 10 minutes it takes in the shower putting on makeup before i go out to set my intentions what i will and wont accept energy wise there is not one way that is the right way to do this but if you are aligned with a creative source then its very hard to seduce you into destructive conversations arguments and reactions p s a bonus one for the road when you come up for air come up laughing
233510 a photograph in a fashion magazine that he waters took that really has kept me thinking over the years
233511 i want to f amp k you like an animal
233512 i want to make experimental music that affects all the senses
233513 we wanted to be entertainers most bands are like public enemy we wanted to be mc hammer we wanted to give you a show
233514 i think that we had to establish a distinctive look for ourselves because we werent very good
233515 so we had to have something to get us going and we figured wed learn the rest on the way
233516 we just stole from everyone thats what good artists do in my opinion
233517 we were opening up for established local rock group feable weiner and we had a buddy that made concert posters so we put our names real big on it and then put with feable weiner under it to make it look like were headlining
233518 and we were passing out flyers telling everybody this band kicks ass you gotta see this band you gotta hear this band
233519 id always go out there and be like yall wanna hear some more songs
233520 and id hype em up and theyd just be screaming and then id be like cds are over there go buy one and theyd be like fuck you and start booing but then go buy it
233521 we really didnt care what anyone in this town ever thought of us
233522 you can be the best band in nashville and what does that really get you what does that mean
233523 a major reason for the perception that we havent worked hard enough to build a fan base in nashville is simply because nashville is one of the only cities in the country where all ages shows and beer sales cant go hand in hand
233524 in most cities you would just get a wristband if youre of legal drinking age and an x on your hand if youre not
233525 why go to fucking new york if someone dont know you in alabama
233526 we had like eight dudes in the same house and we were all just doing drugs and fuckin the same bitches on the same days sometimes at the same time just getting rowdy
233527 we had a guy living in the laundry room jamie lived in the garage everybody played in a band
233528 you kinda just did whatever you had to do to make it
233529 it was all for one and one for all at that point yknow
233530 we played to a room full of suits who were madly texting on their blackberrys the entire time
233531 after the set the curtains closed and jordan schur then president of geffen records ran onstage he was immediately stopped by security but just barreled through them
233532 he was like i gotta have this band with his arms wide open and all that
233533 i think the pink spiders are the kind of band that with the right song would just translate to radio immediately
233534 in my head i was like this is the kind of band where you know the machine could work
233535 the contract we signed was supposedly the best a new band had gotten in years
233536 we wanted to go to a strip club and do all the fun things that you do when you sign a record deal and we were talking to the president at six flags and he was like can you guys even get in there he had no idea that we were old enough to drink
233537 it was one of those once in a lifetime you wouldnt believe it unless you were there kind of things
233538 l a is sunny everyones phony but thats fine new york is grimy
233539 its cold if you hold the door open for someone they think youre trying to mug them
233540 every time matt had a suggestion lord alge would just point at the wall of platinum and gold records he wouldnt even talk
233541 in hindsight ocaseks mix may have been better but it wasnt really thick or big which was what the label wanted
233542 they were like it has to sound like a blink 182 record
233543 i wanted us in the jacuzzi with hot girls like rick james videos something just decadent and ridiculous i wanted us going down the street in a limousine with a hot tub in the back having a ball with girls whod never talk to us unless we had money cause its funny
233544 no dude is gonna admit they like this band after seeing that
233545 their idea was we were gonna be some kind of like backstreet boys band or something
233546 and we were just like thats not really what we are
233547 everyone was kinda like why are these guys on tv
233548 and they thought we were put together by the label too because of the marketing
233549 because those bands had been touring for years with other bands who were kinda big in that punk epitaph records realm the reason they hadnt heard of the pink spiders was because they were playing basements and when they skipped that level people just acted like they came out of nowhere when they were playing far shittier shows than a lot of those guys did
233550 we were on trl in april and the fuckin record comes out in august so this songs being played on the radio like a motherfucker
233551 and there was no product you couldnt go anywhere and get it we did the whole fucking warped tour with a single and no product wed sell some copies of hot pink but we kept thinking we were gonna have teenage graffiti but do you sell this album with all these original recordings of the songs on it its gonna confuse people
233552 maybe they were really expecting that song to take trl by storm and create a buzz for two months it just seems like you wouldnt take that chance with a video that was clearly so expensive
233553 i fought with anyone and everyone at the label until i was out of breath
233554 that seems to be what happens to major an inefficient business where things dont happen on time youll see that on any bands myspace page itll say coming in fall for a while and then itll be like coming in spring coming in summer and maybe they hope to get it out that soon but they just cant
233555 enough catchy charm and ass kicking propulsion to suggest a ballsier weezer or a punk schooled cheap trick
233556 the spiders are ready to spin a power pop revolution
233557 the idea was to have a sort of modern day monkees but not as campy
233558 it was funny cause the motorola reps were like we cant get any bands to hold the gear
233559 it seems like the kind of budget and the kind of approach to it wouldnt happen anymore
233560 it very well might have been one of the last it seemed like the model of advance and plan that you would give a band 10 years ago when people were selling millions of records
233561 but whenever youre talking to the people that hold the cards it doesnt really fucking matter what youre saying
233562 if i cant get that then what the fuck am i doing and it comes to respect for yourself self esteem issues you feel worthless
233563 publishing rights by definition belong to the songwriter when garth brooks writes a song the band that plays on the record doesnt share in the publishing royalties they get paid other ways
233564 fuckin ryan adams splits publishing with his backing band the cardinals
233565 almost everything i made ive put back into this band
233566 any money that the band would make would go back into the band and so the band would have a few grand in the band account but me and bob were just flat broke
233567 wed always go on tours with the idea that at the end of the tour well split the money up and then we made this new record and from the first record we added dave paulsen and we were like all right another guitarist joe reilly is probably not a bad idea and so on this last tour we went out and he decided to bring another person keyboardist raf cevallos and we were kinda like what so then were paying him and were paying another guy to be tour manager and play guitar and they were getting paid about a grand a week but the band members arent getting paid
233568 another thing that id always heard was that if you dont split the publishing you get paid like a hired gun
233569 hell we didnt know that but it does make a lot of sense
233570 what would happen was when the money was out and gone wed have to call our business manager and shed be like okay i gotta call matt and see if thats cool
233571 and shed call matt and matt would give us some money but it was never enough
233572 if the band has money to take two people to take on tour with us but we cant afford to pay my 20 something dollar water bill
233573 bob said the same thing that i would have said if he quit
233574 he said the pink spiders was three people to have that band without those three people was just cheating the fans its more of like a caricature of what it was
233575 i love those guys like brothers and i always will im genuinely just glad that theyre doing what makes them happy isnt that what this is all supposed to be about anyways jons a great songwriter he needs to have his own creative outlet i can completely understand and respect that were still friends weve moved on for the better of everyone involved
233576 all this pressure and all this pain all these sins swim through my veins if i could do it again id probably do it the same
233577 their idea was we were gonna be some kind of like backstreet boys band or something
233578 and we were just like thats not really what we are
233579 they clearly were not really on the same page about anything
233580 anyway congrats on your awesome new game sony im positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat hating heteronormative assholes its not often i have the opportunity to congratulate a cutting edge tech company on such splendiferous retrofuck jackholery way to go the fat princess of shakes manor salutes you
233581 so how about layering karamari style a bunch of random shit on top of the chest like shrubbery rocks bison etc that would also weight it down that could be cute and silly and not reinforce nasty stereotypes about women and the obese

233606 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
233607 there is no shortage of speculative market bears who continue to interpret the generally favorable weather as a sign that yields could still match trend line projections

233616 it may well have made primary schools safe from paedophiles but what of the everyday person on the street where street crime rises
233617 it may well have made primary schools safe from paedophiles but what of the everyday person on the street where street crime rises
233618 police are no more likely to catch offenders in areas with hundreds of cameras than in those with hardly any
233619 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
233620 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
233621 we have to look at look at how can this happen
233622 it doesnt matter in terms of colour or gender or whatever how does it happen that someone can be so severely attacked on our main street and with absolutely no connection to the people who attacked
233623 im realistic enough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
233624 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power
233625 if the commission decisively rules against comcast it will be a remarkable victory for organized people over organized money
233626 defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington every day people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
233627 when i saw the thousands of submissions to the commission by consumers and the standing room only fcc field hearings that we attended and in some cases testified at that part surprised me
233628 that there were that many people paying this much attention to this
233629 however in terms of enforcement this is a first in the world as far as i know
233630 the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantial legal questions
233631 we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
233632 government intrusion into broadband providers traffic management practices would have a chilling effect on investment and innovation
233633 if there is to be regulation therefore it must apply equally to all providers
233634 mr martin is also greasing the skids for a potential barack obama administration to take an internet industrial policy who knows where
233635 net neutrality is a slippery slope toward interventions of all kinds
233636 what martin has proposed and what the commission is about to do is exactly designed to protect innovation and to protect competition
233637 if net neutrality means anything it means not that each of us is made equal in the marketplace but that at least we have an equal set of rules that are transparent to all of us in order to compete
233638 a silk scarf tied ever so nicely just enough bangles on the arm to send out the right chime a striking fragrance to draw out the inner beauty
233639 sometimes all you need are a few lustrous trimmings to help you get your groove back the same goes for pies sometimes you can change the entire appearance and taste of a pie simply by embellishing it with a little meringue top
233640 sometimes there is a little bit of movement that you cant see but that movement and it creates a weakness along the joint seam
233641 we had a little bit of moisture and that moisture causes a force that causes the slope to fail
233642 every year there are a number of rainfalls that gradually weaken the slope
233643 its very much like bending a paper clip back and forth and you dont know when it is going to break

233687 what a pretty pink it turned in the pan and the texture why it reminded me of sour cherries in syrup the slight crispness as you bite into one was so similar
233688 this dish is quite unexpectedly yummy sweet flavorful and fragrant it is probably because of the added fragrant herbs kaffir lime leaves and sweet basil

233699 he was a great neighbor always quick to help out if you needed anything
233700 he was not one of those people who was reclusive and stuck to himself he wasnt that kind of person
233701 that he would be implicated in any kind of way with the anthrax letters and so forth is a tremendous shock
233702 one car would pull up and the other would pull away
233703 theyd be around all the time and then disappear for days so wed try to keep track of who was gone or on vacation then

233732 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
233733 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
233734 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
233735 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
233736 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
233737 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
233738 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
233739 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
233740 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person

233742 business is good you just have to learn how they do things

233745 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business

233770 the sense of hope that had been a part of the establishment of kadima has been lost along the way
233771 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
233772 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
233773 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
233774 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
233775 a couple of artists who used to be signed to my label what happened was like since i was like cause i own my own entertainment company and basically i manage artists i do promotions i do advertising i do everything for them i produce you know anyway i had so many artists i had like five artists including me and what happened was that there was so much time to get everyone in the studio that eventually each and every one was like oh you know hes not doing his job hes doing this hes focusing more on one person and it was just real complicated so what happened was we ended up like i started to get the whole cd together but in the end they kinda all split and basically wanted to go do their own thing so what happened was eventually over time you know i guess a beef kinda rose from all of that
233776 my flow is real versatile i can basically flow in any style i can do more street type of work i can do mainstream i can do club i can do r amp b i can basically do anything anything anything any type of music
233777 what i would do is go back and ask for a joint venture with my company so that way i can kinda join the old business as well and not just be an artist and like have my own company to continue a lot of my business not only the music scene but also like everything else the clothing line the production just the whole deal
233778 my dream car would have to be a lamborghini murcielago lp640
233779 im not really more of a street look i have more of a club look something thats real fashionable something like p diddy pitbull style
233780 really pretty im not saying i mean im not trying to offend girls or anything but you know girls who are really fit really pretty i guess good looking but as well like she has to get along with you on the set but yeah something eye catching something very eye catching
233781 silver golds old its for old people silvers whats in
233782 there are a couple of people like p diddy i admire him for his business because hes an entrepreneur and thats what i want to do i want to do the whole everything the clothing line the production the songwriting he does everything he could possibly do in the industry and thats what i want to do as well as chamillionaire hes real good because he sold a ton of cds i mean he sold cds out of his trunk he went everywhere and just hustled you know i admire him for the hustle i admire pitbull for the style cause pitbull and daddy yankee their style because theyre latin artists but theyre getting known in the hip hop area
233783 i wouldnt say stereotype necessarily id have to say hip hop is sometimes treated like a hardcore genre know what i mean like more street people be looking at other artists and be like oh this guy doesnt do this he doesnt do that and may be comparing him to major artists and so it affects a lot of hip hop artists because they cant last out there because of the way people are they want something new something different
233784 okay i have to say lil wayne because its not like hes bad i mean hes doing his thing and thats good but as far as overrated hes probably the one thats overrated right now but i mean times are changing right now because i mean a lot of rappers are going to be redirected so its going to be switched over
233785 on the hip hop genre id probably work with kanye west id probably work with lil jon producers and stuff like that you know like jermaine dupri as far as different genres id like to work with kinda like rock artists and stuff like that something different like a crossover because not a lot of people cross over and take risks like that id like to try something different
233786 not really ive never really run into trouble because i always try to stay focused you know not do anything stupid to end my career im not just going to go i just think you should stay cautious just stay focused if you really want to make it a lot of people will be like oh you know what lets go steal or go smoke something or well go drink im really good about that im not really the type of artist who will go do that im more focused on my work my career
233787 bikini car wash because the girls at strip clubs are real laughs theyre crazy bikini car wash theyre probably nice girls you know theyre not gold diggers
233788 not really sure ive never really heard any rumors im sure in the future something will come up im sure
233789 i listen to a lot of old school stuff like frank sinatra like that you know like a lot of real classical music i listen to everything you could possibly listen to i listen to everything everything i listen to oldies 80s classical music cause thats what really counts because all the hits that were in the past i mean people will sometimes will pick up their songs again but thats what makes it i listen to all the real major artists you know frank sinatra michael jackson you know all the major artists who impacted the music industry at one time you know those are really important artists who people cant forget
233790 id have to say probably one of my own because im the type of person who likes to make an entrance like i guess you could say i like to promote myself as well
233791 it depends on the situation if its something thats going to effect you later on then go ahead and just you know i mean you cant always walk away from everything you need to be able to face everything that you you know that comes upon you you cant always walk away because then you wont really accomplish anything if you walk away i mean you just have to know when to pick your fights know when to pick em dont pick stupid fights pick the ones that are going to be worth it the ones that are really going to matter

233811 on june 4 sen sununu discussed the possibility of locating the air force cyber command center at the portsmouth naval shipyard with assistant air force secretary william anderson
233812 sununu underscored new hampshires strong technological base skilled workforce and the nearby location of highly regarded colleges and universities and asked that these factors be given strong consideration as the review process moves forward
233813 but weve advocated that the air force look at the brunswick naval air station as well we would be supportive of either one
233814 she isnt endorsing any one proposal she wants to let the process run its course
233815 sen collins said that there are a number of different proposals for the old navy prison under consideration and we will continue to work closely with the shipyard and navy to identify the best use
233816 i remain in active contact with both officials at the portsmouth naval shipyard and the air force regarding the best use for the old shipyard prison and the best location for the headquarters for air force cyber command
233817 currently the navy is carrying out a request for proposal process to decide the future use of the prison it is possible a lease could be signed this year and this would benefit the shipyard and the local communities with jobs and significant economic activity
233818 an attempt to move the cyber command headquarters to the old prison could potentially upset this process also it should be noted the process for locating the cyber command headquarters is well along to conclusion with hanscom air force base in the running as a likely site a place where many new hampshire citizens work since the governor of maine has not submitted a proposal to the air force which is deep into the selection process the likelihood of moving the cyber command headquarters to the old shipyard prison is extremely low the best opportunity to ensure a constructive and economically positive use for the prison is to focus on working together with the shipyard as the rfp process moves forward

233951 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade brad and angelina are the dream couple of the glossy magazine world and we expect to triple our circulation because of the publics fascination and interest in the couple and their children
233952 the number 50 is not a bad word i feel fine and am not sensitive about anyone talking about it
233953 i see it as another excuse to have a party im enjoying life as much as ever as well as all the different things i do directing making music having a family
233954 having children has had an enormous effect on me as a person and creatively when you have children you look at life differently
233955 you have a much fuller sense of appreciation and for the fragility of life and how magical we all are as human beings
233956 i think the criticism that celebrities face when they are tackling humanitarian issues is down to the cynicism of the public people like to criticize its human nature
233957 they cant imagine someone could be doing something for an altruistic reason because they are feeling generous
233958 but i believe that if you have one iota of compassion you cant ignore whats going on you have to figure out ways to be a part of the solution
233959 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
233960 there is some room for optimism on the corporate profit front
233961 but a lot will depend on consumers and energy prices for the remainder of the year
233962 there is another who testifies on my behalf and i know that his testimony is true
233963 you sent messengers to john and he testified to the truth
233964 how do we do what we can to make sure the homes in the state of alaska are heated this winter
233965 the high cost of fuel in rural alaska has gone out of control
233966 theyre going to take that 8 cents and put it in their coffers
233967 if we want this money to actually get to the consumer we need to find another way than suspending this gas tax
233968 the only guarantee is that if we dont suspend the tax the public will go on paying it
233969 there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish but what are they among so many people
233970 after this jesus went to the other side of the sea of galilee also called the sea of tiberius
233971 do not think that i will accuse you before the father your accuser is moses
233972 whoever denies me before others i also will deny before my father in heaven
233973 if you believed in moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
233974 i will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people i will put my words in the mouth of the prophet
233975 if you believed in moses you would believe me for he wrote about me
233976 i can do nothing on my own as i hear i judge because i seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me
233977 22 the prescribed work for gaining a plenary indulgence attached to a church or oratory is a devout visit there which includes the recitation of the lords prayer and the creed pater noster and credo unless otherwise stated in a specific grant
233978 23 1 besides the exclusion of all attachment to sin even venial sin the requirements for gaining a plenary indulgence are the performance of the indulgenced work and fulfillment of three conditions sacramental confession eucharistic communion and prayer for the popes intentions 2 several plenary indulgences may be gained on the basis of a single sacramental confession only one may be gained however on the basis of a single eucharistic communion and prayer for the popes intentions 3 the three conditions may be carried out several days preceding or following performance of the prescribed work but it is more fitting that the communion and the prayer for the popes intentions take place on the day the work is performed 4 if a person is not fully disposed or if the prescribed work and the three mentioned conditions are not fulfilled the indulgence will only be partial
233979 since it is a miserable sinner who speaks to you o god of mercy he askes you to have mercy on his brothers who are burdened with sin and he asks that all those who prentant cross over the threshold of this place receive from you o lord who sees their torment pardon for their evil deeds
233980 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
233981 the american people want congress to roll up its sleeves and get something done on energy
233982 the speakers refusal to keep congress in session until we take action on a comprehensive energy bill is very disappointing refusing to allow even a vote on any of the proposals to increase domestic energy production degrades the institution and the peoples confidence in their government refusing to allow such a vote also means every american will pay more in energy cost than they should
233983 over a year ago i introduced h r 3089 the no more excuses energy act of 2007 the bill would encourage more domestic production of all forms of energy oil gas nuclear and renewables such as wind since the bill was introduced a discharge petition has been filed to try to force it to the floor for a vote and it has been proposed as an amendment to a variety of other bills including two just this past week but the house leadership has never allowed it to come to a vote in fact despite the current energy crisis no bill to provide for new oil and gas production or new nuclear plants has even been voted on in the house of representatives much less gone to the president for his signature
233984 senator stevens has proclaimed his innocence and has sought a speedy trial
233985 todays decision in washington d c is very encouraging it is clear that the trial will begin and conclude prior to the general election this means that the senators innocence will be confirmed before alaskans go to the ballot box in november
233986 clearly we feel the law was misapplied and law enforcement officers who are on duty and during the pursuit or apprehension of an individual who they believed had committed a crime should be an exception
233987 the severity of the charges and the harshness of the punishment are totally disproportionate to the violation in question
233988 it was never the intent of congress to have the gun use charge apply to law enforcement officers carrying a firearm is a requirement of the job
233989 congress must take action immediately to clarify for the courts what seems to be perfectly clear for the rest of america this sends a demoralizing message to law enforcement in our country and an encouraging message to those wishing to do us harm i respectively request that president bush consider the merits of this request and the far reaching effects on the rule of law in our country and restore justice by commuting the sentences of agents ramos and compean
233990 as a former prosecutor and district attorney i have a strong appreciation for the rule of law in our country
233991 its outrageous that these men should be serving more time than killers and rapists to hit them with a gun charge carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years is harsh and unnecessary i once again urge the president to exercise his executive power and right this wrong immediately

234000 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
234001 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
234002 let us demand that the president of the united states call a special session of this congress on energy
234003 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
234004 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
234005 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
234006 the speaker can reconvene if the public interest shall warrant it i cant think of any more important issue to the public today than relief from out of control energy prices why not call us back for a special energy session so that congress can devote its undivided attention to energy im sure members from both sides of the aisle would appreciate the opportunity to debate and vote on a meaningful comprehensive energy policy
234007 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
234008 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

234019 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
234020 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
234021 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
234022 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites

234027 i get a cup of coffee every day on the way to work i mean i can brew a pot at home thatll save 10 12 a week right there
234028 because if you hit frugal on google itll show you a lot of people who are using some very interesting ideas about where to go and what to do
234029 i have to say i feel a lot more optimistic than i did
234030 therefore strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble and make straight paths for your feet so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed pursue peace with all men and the sanctification without which no one will see the lord see to it that no one comes short of the grace of god
234031 it is better to live in a corner of a roof than in a house shared with a contentious woman
234032 exhibiting an often perverse and wearisome tendency to quarrels and disputes
234033 i cry aloud with my voice to the lord i make supplication with my voice to the lord i pour out my complaint before him i declare my trouble before him when my spirit was overwhelmed within me you knew my path in the way where i walk they have hidden a trap for me
234034 an excellent wife who can find for her worth is far above jewels the heart of her husband trusts in her and he will have no lack of gain
234035 does him good and not evil all the days of her life
234036 charm is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman who fears the lord she shall be praised
234037 this is just one of those days where fill in the blank

234093 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up

234098 well thats not documented as the documentation isnt provided by linden lab
234099 the use of the function in this way was nearly universal by this time and the people at linden lab who worked on this code were essentially completely unaware of that fact
234100 who created careers and sold clients investors and the public on this type of mega nonsence
234101 but i think this thinking would be terribly short sighted on lls part
234102 if linden lab suddenly needed a cash influx before then
234103 its a violation when we see it because wed know what a violation is
234104 users feel the virtual community is unsafe and uncensored theyre also deterred by the huge amount of sexually orientated activity which takes place in the world
234105 this will be a huge set back for linden labs sic
234106 last i read the tos and the cs there really isnt anything directly specific to age play

234109 how can you comply when you dont know what to change
234110 are you being broadly offensive how do you know the lindens wont tell you until its too late
234111 ok i removed the shoes just as you requested thanks for the heads up it wont happen again
234112 huh oh ok i just deleted the green shirt sorry again for the problem and thanks again for spotting that for me
234113 open standards in this area are expected to allow virtual worlds to connect together so that users can cross from one world to another just like they can go from one web page to another on the internet today
234114 allowing current business applications and data repositories regardless of their source to function in virtual worlds is anticipated to help enable widespread adoption and rapid dissemination of business capabilities for the 3d internet
234115 at present we have no firm evidence of wrongdoing from our own investigations into wonderland nor from our abuse report channel

234119 in recent months more than 6 000 print journalists have lost their jobs newspaper circulation is down and so is advertising revenue page counts and stock prices
234120 nearly two thirds of american newspapers cover less foreign and national news now than they did three years ago only four american newspapers even have foreign desks
234121 well still get those sort of free dailies they hand out on the metro designed to be read in twenty minutes which are essentially advertising rags with virtually no reporting but the large newspapers are dying and the internet is not going to replace them and i think that the crisis is one that is severe not only for the newsgathering industry but for our democracy as a whole
234122 thanks to the clinton administration we now have five corporations essentially controlling everything that we read see hear and ultimately think
234123 and what my deepest fear is that the future of news will end up looking like the drudge report
234124 some people advocate that blogging is actually this is the beginning of a new era very much like the early newspapers in the early 1800s where youre basically getting a whole new medium opening up the opportunity for more citizen journalism and eventually this will filter itself out into new developed media companies
234125 and we talked about alternative publications but there is a you know real question of as to whether or not we can build employee stock owned papers whether we can build co op models there are different models
234126 the average reader of the paper copy of the new york times spends forty five minutes reading the paper the average viewer of the new york times website spends about seven minutes the internet is not designed for a literate society we are moving into a post literate society a society where information and of course a very limited quality is portrayed primarily through images the internet can make that fusion between print and images

234134 for our clients coming down to lexington and sitting in a courtroom for two or three weeks and hearing all this again was not going to be a pleasant experience
234135 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
234136 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
234137 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
234138 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
234139 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
234140 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
234141 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
234142 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
234143 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person
234144 sometimes ill run down the street and jump into the cab with the chinese person and say ok lets go together the chinese person will usually get out of the cab
234145 business is good you just have to learn how they do things
234146 for instance americans are warm and outgoing japanese are hardworking but stingy germans are inflexible but punctual
234147 the stereotypes were formed historically but may change with passing time
234148 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business
234149 ive learned a few simple phrases of english for the products in my store like green tea beer and coke

234205 sarah lacys very readable book pulls back the veil from the new princes of web 2 0 and that it is as much about attitude as it is about business
234206 i have no knowledge of him taking them around the island
234207 there are lots of stories i have no idea where they are coming from stuff gets made up and it almost becomes true

234211 neighbors will have three to six hours to experience our streets in a new way and to see how livable a city can be when people drive less
234212 this is our chance to experiment and to evaluate how these events work for people and well be fighting global warming at the same time
234213 its a modest action that could have a huge impact
234214 under the old way of thinking the solution to a traffic bottleneck would be build more lanes and invite more cars onto the highway
234215 under a least cost model we look for solutions that cost less and have a smaller negative impact on the environment
234216 while we were shooting the second movie we realized we wanted to make a dvd for the fans
234217 its still difficult for asian actors to get the same breadth of story in their roles
234218 but things are getting better as long as the studios look at us as consumers i think well see positive changes
234219 it can be awkward cause were not stoners ourselves im a blow man myself
234220 we were crossing our fingers for a lot of the first movie
234221 we were hoping white castle would say yes and they did we hoped the studios would say yes to minority protagonists and they did and we hoped nph would say yes
234222 i believe dr sanjay gupta and fareed zakaria could play kumar
234223 but there was absolutely no shortage of asian actors with talent at the auditions
234224 general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the citizens of texas
234225 the lakes are held back by moraines that appear to be giving away we need some advice
234226 imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity
234227 on average if oil prices do not completely collapse wages will about even out with inflation in germany this year
234228 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
234229 if you look at the last three to six months you will see that nato forces have reviewed their procedures as they constantly do and you see that the issue has become less of an issue
234230 when you lose a loved one its natural to be angry to be resentful to blame someone
234231 but the evidence is also pretty clear one weve had progress on civilian casualties and two by and large people have responded very well when we have these rare incidents particularly in the canadian case
234232 by the time our mission ends in 2011 will afghan forces be able to maintain the status quo i think they will from what ive been seeing
234233 what we have is i think a very strong very focused strategy working backwards from 2011
234234 we also know that theres a long way to go and the challenges here are large and the solutions arent going to be overnight
234235 i think what we need to look at is that we are we heading in the right direction and i think we are
234236 i think personally you always wish you could do more but i think weve done pretty well here
234237 build on the collective success of our troops and civilians
234238 you always go down there hoping that you can do something

234248 we could choose to do another audit at a later date but of course we would give them time to implement the core actions

234250 intentionally split change orders processed in the same day for the same contractor
234251 and im hard pressed to say that what they have done wont be sufficient because i believe what did transpire was they were dependant on the players that were there at the time and how do you protect against a very similar situation recurring i dont know
234252 these people that were on the board were elected and the minute you change the players then i would say all of the effectiveness of the rules changes too
234253 russia is our oldest international adoption program so its a privilege to be able to continue serving these children and to find them loving homes
234254 it has been a long process but were so thankful to the russian government for working with us to get to this point
234255 having this accreditation means buckner is able to provide loving homes for russian orphans
234256 the good news about all of this is that russia passed a law which provides accredited adoption agencies with a non expiring certificate
234257 we used to have to reapply for accreditation each year
234258 it has been our goal all along to continue to operate with the highest standards in adoption
234259 we want to show them that they made a good decision
234260 talk about faith and patience theres finally a light at the end of the tunnel
234261 buckner will seek new ways to develop its russian adoption program to help meet the needs of russian children
234262 its going to take a little time we need prayer to help us re establish things quickly
234263 most of the children we see available for adoption are 5 years old or older
234264 what happens here today with the dedication of this church is the reason for everything else thats happened this week
234265 the mother of god desired that a chapel be built to which she would invite her children to come on pilgrimage

234269 tobacco producers and their families will be able to bring closure to what has been a very stressful time
234270 this program is available to help producers exit the industry transition to other crops or find new opportunities outside agriculture
234271 the unique challenges tobacco farmers are facing have never come with easy solutions
234272 as you know farming is a business but its also a proud way of life that goes back generations these funds will help those who wish to continue to produce to do so under a new provincial licensing system
234273 to help communities transition to a non tobacco based economy
234274 it still comes down to the fact you better be a well prepared athlete or you dont have a hope in hell suit or no suit
234275 they are talented and they have the potential the field is tough but i believe that they can still measure up to the competition in beijing
234276 the strategy of pushing propositions likely to draw conservatives to the polls has faltered as republicans face mishaps in drafting measures and a more aggressive opposition

234291 and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
234292 theyre healthy and theyre doing well and im so happy
234293 and of course the parents are really happy and over the moon its a wonderful time
234294 you know 20 000 people used to get the giveaways now its 10 000 and michael kay
234295 what you see here mud and sewage came through the house
234296 it is an old army barracks barged down from the sounds when they were dismantled and put together here
234297 they are sending some pretty firm signals they are going to run out of money and will need a hand
234298 well be taking the matter further with the international rugby board irb and the french
234299 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility
234300 solange epitomizes this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided
234301 one of my guy friends was like youve made my dream before me
234302 i was on the sideline for the one game with my arm in a sling and the coach came over and said are you alisha moses
234303 and he told me that theyd come to watch this game to see how i was going to go so i was pretty gutted because i thought that was my chance gone
234304 it was good to have people with experience to fill me in on what happens
234305 its a tough one because youve got that mixed emotion
234306 do you kind of throw all your toys at it and forget what youve done for four months hopefully we can get that balance right because if we can have a decent performance and grab the three points then i think making the final would be great for wellington and great for the fans
234307 but at the end of the day i just want to make sure were right by august 17
234308 combinations are important well try a few new people and if that produces a result then i guess everybody wins
234309 theres definitely been an added edge i suppose guys are niggly at training and stuff like that
234310 that shows theres a bit of an edge there we just have to make sure we use that
234311 we have to be smart about the way we play and also in the physical side of things and the aggression is what we are after
234312 i was out coached and i will be out coached again
234313 the breakdown is vitally important and i think that is where we perhaps came second last week
234314 how you get to function as a loose forward often depends on what happens in front of you a big way of combating them is to not allow them to get a free go like that
234315 weve been communicating with the coaches throughout the season about who we wanted to be involved in the train on squad and out of those girls only four out of the nine that we selected made themselves available
234316 five pulled out so when it came to the final selection we only took two jess saolete and aimee sutorius out of the four because we still had girls fronting up every week wanting to be a part of it
234317 when youre dealing with a group of 35 or 36 girls its hard to choose two who everyone knows have been to two trainings out of 12 or 13
234318 theres no vendetta here to rugby but we feel like the problem is too often swept under the carpet and players are not really being looked after properly
234319 im just horrified to see mortlock taking the field this weekend
234320 this isnt us causing trouble but obviously we are sensitised to concussion since nicks death
234321 when i saw mortlock in la la land the other week he was just spaced taking just a week off i thought this is ridiculous would a boxer be fighting a week later of course not
234322 were just focusing on getting in the final and then well worry about home finals as well
234323 weve been looking a way to combat that in practice
234324 theyre going to be down a few players as well
234325 theres just too much debris too many rocks flying through the air at the moment to be confident that we can open it to traffic

234331 harvard university researchers have made motor neurons the brain cells that degenerate in patients with
234332 become an embarrassment and you cant blame boston for wanting to see the last of him
234333 every time we come over here we come over with the mindset of getting the job done the history that it hasnt been the case just emphasises how significant the challenge is for us
234334 we have got a positive mindset that if we play well and do the job then well get the result but weve got to front up its a massive challenge for us
234335 in sport you tend to find those hoodoos or string of matches either won or lost but they always get broken eventually
234336 theyve got a challenge and its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see and they are excited
234337 they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are ready to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
234338 obviously what we have brought in the past hasnt been enough were conscious of that but really keen as well
234339 could handle the loss of so many players and still be competitive
234340 the difficultly is when you are not quite sure what you are going to do
234341 you always expect something different its part and parcel of the game
234342 weve put our best foot forward as a group of players they are really trying to do the business its whether we are good enough

234347 i know my future now and obviously thats more or less the whole of my career placed with preston
234348 i can get on with playing for the team now and obviously getting over that final hurdle that everyone wants and thats us getting promotion

234355 i feel pretty in this dress therefore i must be a woman
234356 i am not interested in discovering who i really am i prefer to pretend to be someone else
234357 you have to go there starting with your shape and making sure your shape is good defensively from there you get out into the attack
234358 you cant sit back and absorb all their stuff because youll get hammered you have to make sure youre picking your attacks and going at them and trying to keep possession
234359 you have to be the aggressor if that means getting an early goal thats great but if not at least you approach the game in the right way where youre going out and playing positive
234360 d c can get you at a lot of different areas theyre a very good attacking team as far as im concerned emilio is one of the best forwards in the league you give him time and space he punishes you going into this game we need to limit his shots on goal end of story we need to be stingy with our defense
234361 if i talk to my teammates and communicate more it really helps me stay in tune with the game and helps me direct my teammates into spots that i really need them to be
234362 they have some creative minds on the field and we need to make sure that were always aware whether its off a throw in a quick free kick or just through the run of play we have to make sure that were prepared if were able to possess the ball that will allow us to capitalize on some of our strengths and some of their weaknesses
234363 i think they have a good atmosphere but the tough part about playing in d c is if you let them get a rhythm in the game they make it very difficult for you because you are chasing the ball a lot and mistakes happen because of that the key is making sure they dont have that possession that they can then create
234364 weve put together what we feel like is more of who we are weve realized what makes us good and what makes us successful and were trying to stick to that
234365 one big game maybe a win on the road hopefully in d c can be that game that gets us going up towards the top of the table where we want to be
234366 we feel like were playing better we feel like were creating more chances and defensively we feel solid
234367 at the end of the day it comes down to can we finish our opportunities if we do that were going to be a great team
234368 hes a smart guy he knows his body he had a little bit of an issue with his hamstring
234369 were just going to have to play it day to day to see if hes available for the game on saturday
234370 weve really put ourselves back in a position where we can catch people these games where eastern conference opponents lose points as we gain points are a huge opportunity for us
234371 if we can win this game then weve gotten more than a point a game on the road at this point in the season which is huge
234372 he has suffered moretraining problems and you wont see him again this year hopefully well get him back next year the plan this time was for an autumn campaign and hope he was good enough for the arc
234373 i think he is quite progressive he was a late foal and took time to mature hes been going very well at home
234374 this is a tremendous honor and the first feeling that comes to mind is that dreams can come true
234375 you never know when it will happen but with enough positive intention and belief it can i am ready willing and able to take on this great opportunity unfortunately this comes at the expense of a great athlete paul hamm my heart goes out to him he did an admirable thing and he will always be a hero in my eyes i also want to recognize the other two alternates who are an important part of the soul and spirit of this team
234376 while i havent closed the chapter on that there is a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster going on while i am disappointed that i didnt make the squad im still a part of the team as an alternate which is an honor but at the same time i feel as if i did my job
234377 i was so proud of that guy he was just amazing in every single aspect of what he did
234378 his maturity and everything he has done this year impresses me
234379 can take solace in his role as the star of the olympic trials and thats from no less an authority than bill foster
234380 whether or not he reaches olympics bhavsar in the right place
234381 it turns out the only accomplishment bhavsar wanted this week was to go out on there rock out his routines and have fun doing it
234382 this time around there has been a very large following for myself and the media has taken quite an interest in my comeback and my philosophy on life which is absolutely wonderful
234383 truth be told i actually did better than four years ago
234384 what i found was that my ability to have fun my ability to enjoy the finer things in life that never went away
234385 it started suddenly to dawn that if i can carry this same grounded approach for my next olympic run then no matter what happens i think i am going to be successful either way the motivation finally came back its not so much about training every day in the gym and perfecting a routine so much as it is about trying to be a good human being regardless of what happens in life
234386 the important thing in the olympics is not to win but to take part just as in life the important thing is not the triumph but the struggle
234387 probably the number one lesson that i learned out of all of this is that there is much more to being a great human being than getting in an olympic team or winning a war or having a high paying salary
234388 currently the last page of this book has not been turned yet i am going to beijing maybe to compete maybe not but after that after a long vacation i am thinking about a couple things
234389 public speaking is something that i have been interested in i think many people can relate to my story
234390 many times in life we feel defeated and we take it personally and we give up the motivation we want to be successful
234391 while we believe much potential exists for continued growth of athenahealths top and bottom line results we note that investors have already experienced a rollercoaster ride in the movement of athns shares
234392 we believe the exuberance that drove up the valuation multiple in the months immediately following athenahealths ipo is not a good measure of the valuation range for the company
234393 even the near 60x range the company currently receives is not sustainable in our opinion but we believe the multiple should eventually diminish as the companys growth rate stabilizes
234394 we believe athenahealth offers several attractive investment characteristics including an attractive business model and a relatively open ended earnings growth opportunity

234446 whatever became of that study that caif commissioned for the goodale round did it ever get published what did it conclude about tax leakage
234447 i do want to point out that there is a serious flaw in some analyses especially on the taxation of pension and rrsp accounts finance was not right to treat the impact as zero

234467 the biggest mistake parents make is assuming their child doesnt know where the gun in the house is
234468 kids are smart and if they know theres a firearm in the house theyll probably figure out a way to get to it
234469 parents monitor their kids diet curfew and social life but when it comes to guns parents often just say respect the gun its off limits or guns are dangerous that type of parenting just doesnt work
234470 first you have to weigh whether or not you really need a weapon
234471 do the benefits outweigh the risks if the answer is yes you must take safety precautions
234472 tell them there is a firearm in the home but explicitly explain that guns are fatal no matter how children handle them dont keep the gun loaded and store the ammunition in a locked safe and carry the key with you at all times also dont hide the combination and dont give it an obvious numerical password
234473 the american academy of pediatrics recommends pediatricians ask parents about guns in their home in an effort called anticipatory guidance which attempts to keep children safe in cars on bikes and around swimming pools
234474 its rare that doctors initiate this conversation but they should
234475 also ask the parents of your childrens friends if they keep guns at home and if kids will be playing where theyre stored
234476 dont worry about appearing intrusive its better to seem pushy and be safe

234510 sie werden schmerzhafte kr mpfe und blutungen bekommen die st rker als bei der normalen periode sind gegen die schmerzen k nnen sie schmerzmittel einnehmen sobald die abtreibung erfolgt ist lassen kr mpfe und blutungen nach
234511 die gefahr zu verbluten oder an einer blutvergiftung zu sterben ist nicht zu untersch tzen nicht selten ist eine rein medikament se abtreibung bei fortgeschrittenem schwangerschaftsalter inkomplett beispielsweise kann der mutterkuchen nach dem aussto en des feten in der geb rmutter verbleiben
234512 es ist nat rlich problematisch dass alles nur auf online ausk nften beruht
234513 keiner kann nachpr fen ob die frauen wirklich erst am anfang der schwangerschaft sind keiner wei ob nicht ein junges m dchen diese pillen bestellt
234514 wer eine schwangerschaft abbricht mit freiheitsstrafe bis zu drei jahren oder mit geldstrafe rechnen muss in besonders schweren f llen ist die strafe freiheitsstrafe von sechs monaten bis zu f nf jahren ein besonders schwerer fall liegt in der regel vor wenn der t ter gegen den willen der schwangeren handelt oder leichtfertig die gefahr des todes oder einer schweren gesundheitssch digung der schwangeren verursacht
234515 der tatbestand des 218 nicht verwirklicht ist wenn die schwangere den schwangerschaftsabbruch verlangt und dem arzt durch eine bescheinigung nach 219 nachgewiesen hat dass sie sich mindestens drei tage vor dem eingriff hat beraten lassen
234516 one day someone is going to come out with a voice morphing program that can import all these suckers
234517 one of my main goals is to translate as much emotion as i can through the guitar emotion is something that is lacking in much of todays music
234518 why not change a guitar solo each time there is always room for different expressions
234519 the pickups in the neck and middle positions are unknowns but my bridge pickup is a seymour duncan hotrail i like the extreme differences between the neck and bridge tones it allows me to go from fat and smooth to super hot with a flick of a switch
234520 as far as string gauge goes i tend to alternate between nines and 10s it was my first guitar and i still have yet to play one that feels better than it we have that special bond that those who experience it totally understand
234521 it is 50 watts and is loaded with two eight ohm celestion vintage 30s i like it because it is simple with only one channel and no reverb
234522 i plug my pedal board into the low sensitivity input and run the gain at eight with the bass mid and treble at ten with the presence at about six its a great platform for my pedals because it is nice and warm and stays intact when i run hotter tones i like to keep it as simple and consistent as possible
234523 i occasionally use a crybaby wah pedal a 1 echo delay and a talk box
234524 i dont see an end to equipment possibilities there are so many great tones to discover
234525 there is no telling what pedals or setups ill be using down the road
234526 weve noticed a tendency now for foreign companies to buy u s companies
234527 with the declining dollar and the declining market here things are cheap and the acquisitions weve seen have been preceded by options activity
234528 it sounds like ak steel has put themselves up for sale and are seeking a buyer and we wouldnt be surprised to see either a chinese russian or indian company who seem to be out there shopping in our markets looking at ak steel
234529 the decline in the market has also created an opportunity for stock pickers to come in and look for value and in the case of an activist investor realize that value
234530 theyve insisted they dont want to spin it off but weve seen an awful lot of activity in that name this week
234531 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
234532 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it
234533 i expected one of the english teams fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this card on one hand it is very very tough we know that but on the other very exciting
234534 two sources tell me that u s defender cory gibbs whose promising career has been interrupted by injuries is close to returning to
234535 in a phone call with the player he spoke about his views on football and what role he would like to see arshavin fulfil at the club
234536 ramos gave andrei a key position in his team and arshavin was very pleased
234537 secondly tottenham are the only club who met the terms of andreis personal contract
234538 and they offered zenit virtually all the money which the club wants for the player
234539 thawing permafrost eroding lakeshores a melting glacier and fears of flash floods at a national park on baffin island have forced the evacuation of 21 tourists and led officials to declare much of the wilderness reserve off limits until geologists and ice experts can assess what appear to be the latest dramatic effects of climate change in canadas arctic
234540 this summers events are beyond anything were used to this is no doubt a result of climate change
234541 one has a stronger hand when theres more people playing your same cards
234542 while other aspects of environment were found to be important influences on drinking such as social supply and the deprivation of the locality in which the young person lived the outlet density is an aspect which is amenable to control by public policy and therefore of considerable importance from a public health perspective
234543 he is looking sharp in training will he stay of course
234544 i am not worried not at all in other positions were maybe one player short but up front we dont need anybody else
234545 its part of the fabric of peoples weekly routine here
234546 most of my fun money goes on food films and books
234547 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
234548 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
234549 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me
234550 it was almost like a cult like following from some people
234551 some people have said ive been to listen to you five times and thats lovely on some levels but it just makes me uneasy
234552 these resources will help schools develop programmes that focus on lifting the literacy levels of boys
234553 i get angry about it because its a nonsense its a complete nonsense
234554 what happened in australia is we took an evidence based approach to it
234555 i think thats a really good way to look at it because it looks at whats working rather than whats wrong
234556 looking around and thinking what on earth has this got to do with me
234557 you dont have to look out and search for role models you are the role model you parents will always be the top one in your family
234558 at what stage are we going to call what is just basic discrimination against boys
234559 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
234560 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
234561 gascoigne was my favourite player growing up the first football top i ever got was a tottenham shirt with his name on the back
234562 gazza was great a footballer who enjoyed his football enjoyed his life and just played with that freedom a lot of players looked up to him
234563 id love to be an entertainer like gascoigne i desperately want that but i know i have to start off by earning the right
234564 first of all i have to earn my right to be at this football club a club that is in my heart
234565 the england winger admitted that while he would have loved to have joined spurs when he was a kid it was their bitter rivals that discovered his talents
234566 no one from spurs scouted me at all though i lived just up the road all my mates gave me some stick when i went to arsenal but i have to say it was a great environment to grow up in
234567 i was coming through at the time of the invincible team which went an entire season unbeaten in 2003 04 and set record after record
234568 i just wanted to play regular first team football it has never been about money with me
234569 no one forced me to leave but blackburn offered me what i wanted a real chance to play
234570 once i knew spurs were in and interested ill be honest and admit i thought id never end up here there was only ever going to be one team id sign for
234571 i was trying my nuts off to get here every day i was going through it on the phone trying my hardest to come here
234572 my friends are all season ticket holders and they were on the phone to me every day it has been an emotional time for me
234573 all my mates the tottenham boys loved it absolutely loved it when i signed they all have tottenham tattoos up their arms and down their legs theyre mad fans
234574 they kept phoning to tell me youve got to come to tottenham i told them i want to but they dont want me
234575 it means the world to come here my head and all my passion will be channelled into doing well for tottenham my mates are buzzing now just like me
234576 rachel and ryan talked when he was away from the deejay stand they really looked like good pals he seemed happy to see her

234579 he also has a few tattoos which she loves theyve spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical
234580 theyve been having a great time lees put a smile on her face
234581 as an indie rock label we dont sign things thinking that theyre going to blow up the label itself has a history of admiring new zealand bands

234601 im very aware that in these post christian times in this slack and ill disciplined society holding up a bylaw around what is decent and what is not will be very difficult
234602 i have always been opposed to the objectification of women
234603 as with any event there are those who object or find it offensive but the overwhelming majority of people are supportive
234604 most new zealanders know it is indecent and inappropriate to be topless in a public place
234605 for those who stand for decency and who seek to protect families and children a parade during lunchtime down a major street will cause widespread offence
234606 although none of us were aware of it our action so impressed the band that they offered to put on a free concert in our auditorium
234607 they didnt tell anybody except our principal brian oconnell and year 12 dean jo white
234608 we didnt know what to expect when the two top years were called to what we were told was an emergency meeting in the auditorium and wow we were thrilled

234655 isaac is humble and businesslike hes a pro basically just handle your business and i know youre going to handle yours
234656 you know how it is you get in 10 years and get into your 30s and plus and some people say you dont have it anymore and you start to lose a step
234657 rightfully so i want to come out and say for my 10th year that i came out and played well
234658 i have to be smarter and work smarter and give myself time to heal
234659 but at the same time give myself a chance to see whats going on feel the offense more so i can be ready for the main thing and thats sunday
234660 i have to continue to talk to myself and say hey torry just pull back and just relax
234661 any rep he takes we want it to be a really quality rep
234662 the nfl and you never get it when youre younger is more mental than physical
234663 his technique is better than any receiver in the league and his physical abilities are still unbelievable he still has it
234664 al is a terrific teacher a tremendous motivator and demands excellence
234665 its a vertical game its fast and the tempo is good so its exciting
234666 you could see that someone took the time someone loved her enough to put clothes on her
234667 the thinking was it was young girls who became pregnant and didnt know what to do there have been situations where a person has abandoned a baby and went home and found a family member was very supportive we go from there
234668 there is so much help out there that all they need to do is call a social service agency or a church
234669 there are places to go that would provide information anonymously and confidentially to anyone who is feeling trapped by pregnancy or parenting
234670 it would be better to get help and think it through than to abandon your baby and have second thoughts all your life
234671 the baby wasnt thrown in the trash she wasnt thrown in the toilet mama did a good job there
234672 i hope she knows that she did the right thing her baby is safe
234673 staurt rose from the ditch climbed into his car and started up the road that led toward the north the sun was just coming up over the hills on his right as he peered ahead into the great land that stretched before him the way seemed long but the sky was bright and he somehow felt he was headed in the right direction
234674 to hit a homer that gives us a lead which weve not had a lot of lately is certainly a great memory thats probably the best ball ive hit all year
234675 the competitor in me wants to be perfect right away
234676 but i know its going to take a little time i was a little more confident this time
234677 he makes good pitches and gets good hitters out and then he makes mistakes
234678 theres no question at all the obama campaign has crossed over to popular culture
234679 ive seen candidates give away t shirts for their campaign
234680 ive never seen consumers from the bottom up latch on
234681 the image got out on the web and traveled virally
234682 last election would you have wanted to wear a t shirt with either bush or kerry on it
234683 what could the devil do to best keep me away from god
234684 there are so many initiatives so many candidates i looked at my sample ballot the other day and its a mini phone book of people running for office
234685 i think when obama and mccain both speak out about it it piques peoples interest
234686 if they succeed in liberal states its hard to see how they wouldnt succeed in places like arizona and nebraska
234687 i do not believe in quotas i have not seen the details of some of these proposals but ive always opposed quotas
234688 he talks about how he opposes quotas and therefore supports the initiative but quotas are illegal across the country and have been for quite some time
234689 his statements clearly demonstrate he doesnt understand what arizona laws are and what is at stake in this election
234690 john mccain believes in the protection of civil rights and equal opportunity for all americans
234691 hes committed to aggressively enforcing our nations anti discrimination laws and to the education of all of americas children so they have the necessary tools to compete and succeed in life
234692 its clear to me that he did change his position but so did millions of americans over the last few years
234693 senator obama should be grateful for race flippers because if it wasnt for them he would not have been elected the nominee of the democratic party
234694 obama asked later that day about mccains position on the measure said he was
234695 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
234696 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
234697 but ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
234698 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
234699 it has to be pretty drastic for the state to take this measure
234700 the dna testing results conclusively exonerate both mr white and mr winslow as the persons who raped and murdered mrs wilson
234701 which is favorable to the person in custody and material to the issue of the guilt of the person in custody
234702 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
234703 the economy will get worse and that can certainly generate more weakness in the labour market
234704 hi im insert your name here i work in the instert where you work here
234705 shout out to nick catchdubs the motherfucking carpenter of flyness
234706 die haben mich als ich wieder in athen war zu sich gerufen und mir mitgeteilt dass ich in zwei tagen abreisen m sste
234707 ich gehe normalerweise eher nach dem prinzip learning by doing vor das war dann eben ein bisschen h rteres lernen
234708 weil ich da selber schuld war und mir das vorher alles nicht ordentlich durchgelesen habe
234709 weil es mir als sportler die riesige chance einer pers nlichen plattform nimmt das finde ich nicht ganz nachvollziehbar aber die werden ihre gr nde haben
234710 es soll vor allem verhindert werden dass athleten ihre position f r diverse medien ausnutzen und dann etwas gezielt und geplant inszenieren
234711 es wurde der aktuellen technischen entwicklung rechnung getragen und erstmals eine neue richtlinie nur zum blogging entwickelt
234712 auch mit r cksicht auf die rechtlich komplizierte welt des sich schnell entwickelnden mediums internet
234713 ich wei dass ich nur ber mich schreiben und auch keine fotos online stellen darf
234714 wir tragen das dann mit aber ich denke das sind konstruierte f lle das wird sicher nicht passieren
234715 aber dann gibt es immer noch die sichere l sung in der form von interviews
234716 as for georgia several factors propelled its move up the rankings
234717 ten years ago just 21 percent of georgias adult population had a college degree badly lagging the national average today 28 percent of the population has a degree on par with the rest of the u s the jump is the second biggest improvement by any state after maine
234718 the musical starlights of sir andrew lloyd webber and the disney musical productions
234719 we also are adding a faculty dog to assist students who maybe are having a bad day or just need somebody to read to
234720 im not happy that this has been used in this way mr rout said
234721 it would have been about 40 per cent of the boat market about 80 to 100 boats in the champs
234722 invalid and that he had personally met with mr rout to discuss moving forward from the matter
234723 were both keen to move on and build a relationship together for the future
234724 that letter is tiny in comparison to the rest of the bid application weve known about it for a year fisa know about it the police know about it and weve covered it off
234725 i like doing hot button topics the michael richards incident pushed the n word over the edge its now a fighting word
234726 its truly an honor to be recognized nationally by ones peers especially for work on subjects that im passionate about namely black history and the black experience ive seen the dichotomy about the n word debated behind closed doors all my life when stories about its use exploded both locally the coach and nationally the comedian the timing was prime to explore the controversy even deeper
234727 the first four weeks in hospital i didnt want to look in the mirror at photos nothing but then i finally popped a brave pill
234728 i couldnt do much at all dianne was my full time nurse at home i couldnt even go to the toilet on my own
234729 you use your hands with everything you do even just moving round in bed mine were all strapped up with splints so i had to use my elbows a lot to shift around
234730 theyve been bloody good when i was first out of hospital there was a truck here every day coming to see me and asking if there was anything they could do to help
234731 the turnout was absolutely bloody amazing even the guard of honour from police lined up from the countdown corner right down to victoria st there would have been a 100 or so
234732 once a firefighter always a firefighter and i guess the fact i dont remember the two vital hours i dont remember the fire or explosion i last remember standing beside the truck and then the doctor telling me he was going to put some staples in my head
234733 it will be interesting to see what does come out of it the only thing i would like to see is that it doesnt happen again thats the most important thing
234734 ive seen him three or four times hes doing extremely well and as far as i know theyre very happy with the way hes going
234735 i thought it was pretty neat especially since she arrived in a fire engine they drove her from the hamilton central fire station to the casino
234736 the swells got to about 7m and the captain turned the ship so we were going with the swell rather than against it the captain then told us we were going to turn to get back on to a safer course and it was in that manoeuvre that we hit two waves at once
234737 unfortunately it was enough to smash crockery and send tables flying some people were injured but some just panicked i think it was more a mental thing
234738 there were people with some more serious injuries needing medical assistance but i dont know the details
234739 some people were freaking out but all the crew were saying was to go down below to our cabins because there would be less rocking and so people who needed treatment got it quickly
234740 i felt sorry for the crew they fed everyone made sure we were all okay and they were happy the whole time they really stepped up it probably increased my respect for them
234741 desde enero de este a o se ha venido discutiendo la renovaci n de esta ley habilitante que ha sido denominada la madre de todas las leyes y que hasta el momento le ha dado oportunidad al presidente para legislar en 11 mbitos
234742 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
234743 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
234744 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers
234745 however the data shows that the problem is much broader than just with minorities and low income households my belief is if we widen our lenses to see that this problem affects all segments of society we will change the tone and context of our approach to solutions
234746 the waves have been moving right up and over a high dune crossing the properties and even reaching point rd theres a lot of water and its causing big problems
234747 the sea has been taking the sand out from around and behind them and theyre just tumbling away
234748 this time around fences have gone and on one section a shed has been left hanging right on the edge another property has had at least a metre of lawn removed from in front of the housess patio
234749 the only thing i have heard of is that the storm surge up the waitara river caused some concern overnight but there was no damage
234750 we were waiting for the outcome and we will go further now
234751 our operator made the initial mistake and issued the ticket so we have to wear some of that but if he dyke had just fronted up at the start it wouldnt have cost him 17 000 it wouldnt have even cost him 16 000 we could have come to some agreement
234752 as far as the charges are concerned i didnt do anything wrong as far as the penalty is concerned im considering other options
234753 all my owners except for one have been very loyal both morally and financially
234754 ned kelly became famous once and the next good horse i get i will race it in australia
234755 the financial result is of grave concern to us as we head into the new year
234756 sharp decline in credit card spending challenges the popular belief that americans are charging basic goods in order to sustain their quality of life
234757 this is an official change to my will we are in approximately 50 foot waves nearly on our side
234758 if we get out of this it will be a miracle sorry to be so negative but would give anything to be able to hold you kids right now love you so much
234759 i know this sounds negative but if anything happens make sure you get legal advice and sue the company
234760 she had been in tears and it was basically her saying her final goodbyes
234761 we were up in the bar by the casino and all of the glasses and bottles in the bar were crashing down everybody was grabbing hold of their drinks
234762 you were holding on for dear life we were just hanging on you just had to hang on you just saw people sliding and flying and things crashing around
234763 you could see the look of fear on their faces cause something that big was coming hurtling across the room towards them and they couldnt move out of the way
234764 in the dining rooms the tables were bolted down but nothing else was and everything else just went flying
234765 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
234766 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
234767 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
234768 i believe were fairly confident well be able to manage flight attendant staffing through the leave program

234791 basketball was a time of my life this is my roots basketball was a little drop of my life thats why it was so easy to turn the page
234792 i didnt sleep well for about a year or two after the scandal at minnesota
234793 it takes a lifetime to build a reputation and one minute to knock it to pieces i came back where people know me they know what im all about and who i am im home
234794 among the most serious academic fraud violations to come before it in the past 20 years
234795 i never once asked a young man to do something wrong to cheat or to protect me never im not perfect but i never did anything that would embarrass or hurt the university the community or the program if i did anything wrong it was because i was trying to help an individual someone who needed my help
234796 what they say in the end when they put out that piece of paper it doesnt have to be the truth
234797 what people think happened at minnesota and what happened they arent the same the problem is once youre guilty youre guilty you cant ever shake it whats said about you is the truth forever
234798 the committee noted the violations were significant widespread and intentional it should be noted that the university and enforcement staff were in agreement on the findings of violations and facts in the case
234799 when he came to the high school he fit in immediately
234800 people here dont give a damn about what the press says

234802 but now hes just a regular joe like the rest of us
234803 of course i missed it at first i started playing basketball when i was 11 years old anyone who does something that long and then says they dont miss it is lying you get set in a routine as much as anything i was used to going to practice to getting ready for games that routine is a comfort and when you dont have it depression can set in all those empty hours but farming filled my void i have something to do every day every hour if i want to this is who i am and im very happy with who i am

234807 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled

234809 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
234810 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
234811 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
234812 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart

234840 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter not grow

234845 we selected openlink because we judged it the most flexible solution to allow us to expand our business in terms of number of positions regions transactions and product catalog
234846 sas is the best one stop bi shop that includes high end analytics from a single vendor
234847 we see no reason sas cant continue on its amazing track record of uninterrupted 32 year growth
234848 even though several other vendors realise or are starting to realise the value of providing higher end analytics tools like statistical analysis and predictive modelling sas is pretty hard to beat in this category especially when it comes to embedding such analytical routines in powerful dbms engines like teradata
234849 using sas enterprise bi server brooks brothers has been able to turn data into an increasingly strategic corporate asset
234850 we are now able to focus on the performance indicators that matter most and proactively determine what actions will yield the most favorable results we use our data to power better business decisions
234851 as we expected the sas bi solution allows brooks brothers to quickly see how actions contribute to reaching our goals but the more we use sas software the more its value increases
234852 this aligns perfectly with our corporate mission to offer a superior combination of products service delivery and communications we deployed sas and our customers benefit
234853 we feel that right now for these markets we are right sized
234854 we dont rule anything out well continue to monitor the situation and well adjust as needed
234855 ad comparing barack obama to a celebrities such as paris hilton and britney spears
234856 your candidate started by saying he wanted to run a different type of campaign do you want to put out a pledge no more ads like this lets leave the personal alone lets talk about what well do for america
234857 well listen i think the ad is a great ad i think its getting a lot of attention which was exactly what it was designed to do
234858 but is this the type of discussion you want that youre comparing the candidate that youre running against to paris hilton that its frivolous childish is that good for you
234859 he obama doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
234860 what does that mean if its not a suggestion that his race is going to be used against him
234861 hes said this repeatedly as you mentioned all over the country hes noted hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes young hes new to washington yes hes african american
234862 looking to get attention theres been a lot of attention given to obama
234863 average daily kos diarist sitting at home in his mothers basement
234864 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
234865 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
234866 if obama is president will we still call it the white house
234867 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
234868 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
234869 the dnc is well known for supporting such racists as andrew jackson george wallace and lbj
234870 and he may very well know that the religious folks who some would
234871 spurred by what it considers below the belt attacks on his character fitness and even his fame barack obama is firing back
234872 and obamas campaign has just created a new website the low road express
234873 what is striking about mccains sharper edge criticized by several newspapers recently is how it appears to conflict with some of his more high minded talk of the need for civility on the stump
234874 the sharper tone has been noted since mccain put associates of karl rove in charge of his campaign rove was the mastermind of president bushs election victories
234875 we got up early for prayers and i went down to have a wash
234876 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
234877 and five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion

234889 when i hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient that scares me and i think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very very important and should be a welcome trend in the united states
234890 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken
234891 it is time for a new a different and a better approach
234892 we are looking at mileage based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel we are looking at private sector investments
234893 you would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses yet this was one they failed to accurately assess it was like a meteor falling to the ground
234894 i say how did we get money for stadiums how did we get money for all these new stadiums were building
234895 whats more important baseball or safe traveling should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now

234904 i was very cognizant of knowing it had to be there prior to the 30 day requirement
234905 the court feels there is a statutory requirement mr kulkin reside in district 3
234906 if were talking about where i sleep more i sleep more at 8825 n linda if you talk about where i spend more time during the day its probably 2530 tough boy road or im out working
234907 i still believe that the law supports that i only have to live in the county but i wanted to show good faith to the people who elected me to district 3
234908 it was common knowledge that he set up a residence on tough boy i got involved because i felt if a person would go to the extent of stretching the limits of the boundaries of the district to run what would they do in office
234909 thanks to bonaventure the precedent has been set that anybody with a winnebago can park it in someones yard call it home and run for an office
234910 in february 2003 he disrupted a meeting of the pahrump regional planning commission
234911 friday afternoon following the aug 15 primary kulkin paid a visit to democratic central committee headquarters on highway 160 in pahrump in a fit of rage over his election loss kulkin accused the party of playing favorites and then trashed the place
234912 kulkin allegedly kicked over a cabinet and swept his arm across a desk knocking off flyers and other campaign materials he also reportedly threatened jack woods the 72 year old vice chairman of the organization the only one present at the time
234913 its a wonder all i did was knock over a coffee pot im a human being i have feelings
234914 this man is very fortunate that mr woods didnt have a heart attack
234915 both sides believe there is something called the master narrative
234916 yes there is an abundance of voices and sources trying to influence that master narrative but it does finally get set and once its set its virtually impossible to change so everyone is doing their best to stop the master narrative from setting in a way that disadvantages their side
234917 accusing someone else of being a press darling is an element in the effort to destabilize a hardening narrative
234918 hey what about the anthrax attacks in 2001 whatever happened with that why did bushco lose interest

234923 yo obtuve exactamente lo que quer a de este trato los hechos claros en esta situaci n
234924 me siento mucho mejor sabiendo que nelson dijo bajo juramento que durante los juegos de dallas en las finales de la nba en el 2006 se estaba reuniendo con la gerencia de golden state y ayudando a los warriors a trabajar en sus planes y que l y sus abogados hab an comenzado charlas m s de un mes antes de que aceptara el trabajo y no solamente unos d as antes como l hab a dicho p blicamente
234925 desafortunadamente seg n el arbitraje debido a que retuve alrededor de 25 000 en pagos por consultor a al tratar de entender esta situaci n estoy obligado a hacer ese pago diferido que deb a hacerle a l b sicamente le pagu exactamente el mismo monto que hubiese tenido que pagarle si esto no suced a

234929 sta no es la manera en que yo hubiese querido que todo suceda yo quer a ser el red auerbach de los dallas mavericks luego de haber sido entrenador pero eso no fue lo que cuban quiso la buena noticia es que esto me ha forzado a seguir siendo entrenador y realmente disfruto trabajando con mully chris mullin vicepresidente de operaciones de b squet de los warriors y de poder regresar con los warriors me estoy divirtiendo nuevamente y esa es la manera en que deber a ser todo est funcionando muy bien y probablemente voy a terminar haciendo algo en un rol de patriarca de franquicia como lo hubiese hecho en dallas

234934 the most challenging part of the project was nanoengineering a coating robust enough to withstand the high temperatures of firing and that would still release the tags when touched

234946 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet
234947 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
234948 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
234949 we thought aw maybe it was just a bad test
234950 it took three or four races before we could even admit it
234951 it was like one of those addiction recovery things where you have to admit it first before you can deal with it
234952 i feel energized and pumped up and ready to give my audiences a great performance
234953 there are huge benefits to selling content exclusively on the web most definitely
234954 we considered doing dvd sales and honestly it doesnt seem like the profit margins are worth the inherent risks of having to know what youre legally able to send to one place or another there are some really ancient almost puritanical laws in some places saying you cant look at this or that in texas anal sex wasnt legal until 2003
234955 our sales literally quadrupled in the course of one month when we started looking into what niches werent overly catered to and we searched forums searched interest groups had conversations with different people and got feedback from our members and when we found something that wasnt being paid attention to and something we could do in our own style thats what we went for
234956 i think just because of the availability youre going to see people trying things and looking at things that they normally might not
234957 there are so many more outlets now people are allowed to explore things a lot more openly and freely and completely because it exists on the web they might find that they dont enjoy it but that moves them on to the next thing the internet does a lot for cultivating more specific tastes over the long term
234958 its something that my wife and i were into and when we had our son we went through this puritanical phase and got all the porn out of the house
234959 i uploaded it all to a yahoo group which we completely forgot about we came back to it a year later and discovered that there were like 10 000 members of the group so that was the market i went after thats why i decided to do it
234960 our first site was indecisivecaptions com and from there we launched three additional sites that are pretty unique
234961 theyre fetish focused sites but what makes them stand out is that the medium isnt your traditional photo sets or cams
234962 and a number of free sites that involve blogs also we just entered into a partnership to launch a site called orgasmdenial com pretty much the biggest community resource site in that particular niche
234963 the fact that my business is a canadian company and that im located in canada and i do my production in canada that protects me a great deal
234964 the fact that i do business on the internet that really doesnt make a difference
234965 theres also privacy legislation in canada that essentially says that what you have to do to comply with 2257 in the u s is illegal so one of the challenges for a canadian based business is that to fully comply with 2257 wed have to violate canadian privacy laws so we kind of have to split the difference
234966 if youre in this industry and not comfortable with risk youre in the wrong place
234967 and our political system doesnt lend itself to an attorney general who wants to go after some guy on an obscenity conviction just to make himself look good for the next election id much rather operate my business out of canada than the u s
234968 the internet has liberated the kinksters of the world and theres business opportunities in becoming a one stop shop for people that are into these kinks we work very hard to make ourselves a trusted partner for our customers and part of that is putting our credibility on the line by saying if you want to buy a chastity device weve done the research and weve found a partner who isnt going to screw you theyre a trustworthy retailer
234969 you can look at material on websites meet people someplace like alt com the alternative lifestyles personals site which claims some 3 5 million members and you can get the toys to play with on stockroom com it brings together people from all over the country in the small town you live in in idaho for example there might not be the people that share your interests but the internet gives you the opportunity to come together and find those common interests
234970 the bdsm movement is kind of following in the same footsteps as the gay movement
234971 it was declassified as being a mental disorder which kind of helped but i think intelligent people are more likely to get bored with the same old thing and people are looking for ways to spice their sex lives up so youre going to see more people taking that next step into whats interesting we certainly notice that
234972 i think even the mainstream are starting to get it because people that are looking for something specific spend more money and stay in one place longer
234973 i think the mainstream providers and producers are catching on that people are always looking for that next thing
234974 the present situation results from the fact that the protection of society has received more emphasis than the rehabilitation of inmates consequently we have decided from now on to stress the rehabilitation of offenders rather than the protection of society

234978 is launching a package of initiatives on private investment projects carried out by the government after amending the instructions of the execution of contracts for projects by contractors

234982 a building within the office of the ministry of planning and decision of the minister
234983 the formation and operation of the court came at the recommendations that were submitted to the council of ministers on the work of companies in iraq
234984 working to adjudicate in cases of government contracting with contractors implementing the projects
234985 the work of the tribunal is to achieve transparency through the control mechanism of contract with contractors with the government to implement the projects
234986 got the cabinet approval to begin rebuilding and rehabilitation of buildings and the former ministry of planning which is located at the gate of the ministry of defence present
234987 faced administrative and technical difficulties to obtain the consent of prime minister to restore the building and begin the process of rehabilitation and the first phase of construction have been allocated 42 billion dinars and will work within a few months
234988 because the amounts of consumer double the amount of investment whereas the vision of the ministry of planning considers the need to allocate funds to invest more than consumption because the country needed to invest and build to absorb unemployment and the establishment of large scale projects the country could recover through
234989 the motives of the ministry of finance and the allocation amounts of consumer double the amount of investment came to extinguish iraqs debts and amounts of ration cards and to increase staff salaries but does not prohibit the re consideration of the budget and retrenchment
234990 court set up by the ministry of planning after coordination with the supreme judicial council
234991 membership director general service contracts in the ministry of planning and representatives from the federation of iraqi contractors and another representative federation of iraqi chambers of commerce and industry and take the building of the ministry of planning current headquartered

234993 the court began its work after receiving 11 a lawsuit which was completed eight cases and the remainder under consideration by the court
234994 will work together with regulatory and accounting devices in the country of the office of financial supervision authority and the competent organs of integrity
234995 all three contracts are dead in the water and management has to start over at the beginning
234996 financial analysts at the time of the papers purchase said avista wanted to cut costs and resell the paper what better way to cut costs than force concessions down the throats of all the unions
234997 they showed a lot more backbone than the newsroom folks

235031 its their standard line they always wanted to have the freedom to raise the interest rate at any time for any reason
235032 at some point you have to reasonably assume that theres a pattern
235033 this is not going to go through the senate this year

235035 the company did not see at the time how it failed to take all reasonable steps
235036 we cant say how it the sliver got there we wish we could and as a consequence must face and take responsibility for that

235044 opponents to the ban are using the same arguments theyve used for any legislation that attempts to limit abortion

235046 there is a perception out there that heat pumps are almost free to use that is not the case at all
235047 we dont think it would be uncommon for people who are running them really hard to incur costs of up to 5 a day
235048 i think that is almost certainly what we are seeing here
235049 more and more new zealanders are getting heat pumps so all retailers will be facing similar issues

235076 a new mccain ad compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton apparently obama fired back by comparing mccain to george burns and the mummy
235077 mccain is not backing down hes defending the commercial where he compared barack obama to paris hilton as being all talk and little action thats what he said like paris barack obama is all talk and little action really has he seen her sex video there is no talk it is
235078 demeaning obama is not why this is a dick move by mccain
235079 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
235080 insiders say hillary was never on obamas vp list obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket bad enough to worry about jesse cutting them off didnt want to worry about hillary breaking them too you know what im saying

235084 yesterday the united nations announced that it will increase the interior temperature of their 39 story office headquarters in new york city by 5 degrees fahrenheit pushing the temperature to 77 degrees what better way to make sure 4 500 people of varying cultural and political backgrounds work cohesively and without conflict than to cram them all into a building and crank up the heat

235087 i work hard every day in practice throughout the whole year
235088 its been that way since i got here three years ago nothing changed
235089 i look at it that this is a group of guys that i can go win a ring with i can be a part of something special i have my personal goals but they definitely dont supersede what were trying to do as a team and what i want to be a part of collectively
235090 a lot of guys want to get that attention and be high profile sometimes it makes them more marketable i guess but i think that getting that ring on my finger would be sweeter than any of that stuff
235091 there are a lot of guys on this roster that are extremely valuable to this team even if they dont show up in the stats every week
235092 everybody in this locker room is talented and weve got a great football team i want to do my part and any way i can and contribute

235095 do you deny that youve been in telephone contact with rielle hunter since she found out she was pregnant
235096 the absence of any follow up reporting from the enquirer or any other source
235097 question what former nba players latest charity outreach involves providing housing for unwed pregnant women
235098 what an odd denial who accused young of funneling campaign funds to support rielle in the first place i wonder if any member of our crack mainstream media will bother to check into this interesting thread

235129 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
235130 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
235131 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
235132 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
235133 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
235134 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
235135 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
235136 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
235137 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
235138 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
235139 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

235151 i think what were running into is a kind of difficult rubbing between the indaba process which has been in large measure very conversational very relational
235152 seeking to find structures and procedures whereby we can remain in communion with one another
235153 how the two can interface for the well being is a huge challenge at this moment

235155 it was about two or three months ago all the taxis in our company had this fitted
235156 there is a screen which displayes the exact location of the vehicle the taxi is also able to send information back to us at the control station all the taxis registered with us have had the modifications
235157 in the case of any danger the cabs are all fitted with cameras i think its on the right hand side of the cab above the passenger to the right that camera is constantly switched on
235158 we cant see the video back at the control station but we can do audio surveillance the gps signal enables us to hear whatever is happening on board the cab
235159 its all computerized if anything happens in the cab it will show up on the screen if anything happens that needs reporting to the police there are people who are hired just to do surveillance there are more than 100 of them
235160 those are people who are just hired to monitor the in cab microphones there are even more of us to control and dispatch the cars
235161 before 2008 the beijing authorities will have spent a total of 1 9 billion yuan u s 278 million to install gps tracking systems on all of the citys 10 000 buses
235162 it also has a budget of 680 million yuan u s 99 million to complete its installation in the citys taxi cabs so a central monitoring station will know the precise location of every individual cab at all times
235163 we do not go beyond normal security measures and relevant security practices and measures that are commonly employed in the international arena whether in hotels or in other public places

235176 women of faith can offer a moderating voice that has the potential to curb extremism
235177 women of faith tend to represent religions human face and to maintain a distance from its power politics from this position they have great potential to enhance the contribution of religion to peace and to mitigate its role in violent conflict
235178 patriarchy allows the subordination of women and is a form of structural violence
235179 religious chauvinism is a major factor behind conflicts over religion and in the way that religion is used to inflame conflicts of a political nature
235180 faith teachings and understandings of justice and humanity provide a moral lens that help women to recognise injustice faith offers a frame of reference that assists women in identifying something as wrong
235181 the importance of this is fundamental it is not possible to challenge an injustice that we are not aware of or able to see the moral lens that faith provides is crucial in prompting women of faith into action
235182 to be active in our faith means that we are able to use our gospel values as a mirror in which to view conditions in society and to struggle to bring about change
235183 challenging injustice and working for a better world are seen by many as the very essence of what it means to be a woman of faith
235184 whether religious or lay women of faith tend not to distinguish between their work their faith and their worship each flows into and sustains the other
235185 inner resolve rather than an expectation of rewards or power
235186 the source of remarkable commitment and determination and gives women of faith the strength to keep going even when difficulties appear insurmountable
235187 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
235188 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
235189 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
235190 we must acknowledge that there are great tensions in our relationship at present and an erosion of trust between us
235191 we havent suddenly reached a consensus about the issues of human sexuality the problems are not all solved but there are significant differences
235192 we are able to look at each other we are able to shed tears with one another but at the same time knowing that weve got different ways and different convictions
235193 president bush must use the opportunity provided by his attendance at the olympics to make clear to president hu that the united states expects the chinese to begin sincere and concrete negotiations with the dalai lama on the future of tibet
235194 the house expects progress not promises at a time of crisis for the tibetan people ict commends the house leadership and chairman berman and his foreign affairs committee colleagues for advancing this timely legislation

235201 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
235202 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
235203 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
235204 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
235205 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
235206 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
235207 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
235208 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
235209 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
235210 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
235211 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
235212 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
235213 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
235214 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
235215 in todays culture is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was for those who brandished it most seriously a symbol of violence rhetorical political and literal against the united states it was the high sign for a racist militia the black panthers which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with americas enemies
235216 but even a more benign view of the salute shouldnt obscure the intense contradictions of espns decision to honor carlos and smith both men were members of the olympic committee for human rights which wanted a complete black boycott of the 68 olympics the committee considered an entire generation of heroic black athletes including jesse owens and jackie robinson to be uncle toms
235217 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
235218 another important distinction that should matter is that this was 1968 not 1938 by the end of the 1960s the united states had seen two decades of steady if too slow racial progress the black power vision of an irredeemably racist amerikkka was all but blind to the desegregation of the military the accomplishments of owens and robinson and the civil rights acts of 1957 1960 1964 and even 1968 one hopes espn disagrees with those views as well
235219 but the question is not and never has been whether the olympic ideal can be achieved but whether it should be pursued by embracing those who spat on that idea it seems espn thinks the answer is no
235220 we want people to be open and honest and frankly talk about the issues
235221 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
235222 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
235223 what they have done is taken a big step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
235224 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
235225 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
235226 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
235227 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
235228 niagra and our open storage products really represent the future of how our company is being rebuilt

235242 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
235243 in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
235244 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
235245 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
235246 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
235247 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke or ms albright is or whether that arm can reach me here
235248 in june of 1996 i went to belgrade and negotiated an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that he would quit as president of the serb portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
235249 he karadzic reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations but then in order to protect himself he put out this false story
235250 such a deal never existed there has not been any attempt to drop the charges against karadzic
235251 both holbrooke and i were actively involved in the 1990s in an attempt to get nato to intervene to have him arrested this failed but that is another story
235252 fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal protection it then became clear to me that i could not come before the tribunal because the conditions for a fair trial would not be met

235259 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
235260 here in western lands men were fighting again the age old struggle for freedom and for civilization which is one that always must fought for the weak and those unwilling to make the struggle soon resign their liberties for the protection of poweful men or paid armies they begin by being protected they end by being subjected

235322 the concept reminded me of two games in particular the rubiks cube and sudoku both of those have several things in common its all about getting people to play with rules and laws we wanted the same with echochrome only rules and challenges nothing else

235325 when i moved back to iowa after leaving the marines i felt like everything i was hearing on the news was so one sided
235326 for those of us who fought in the iraq war we werent really getting the chance or were not given the voice to express our perceptions of what was really happening on the ground which seemed to be the opposite of what people were hearing in the news
235327 during my deployments i also thought it was a morale downer whenever i read the newspaper and the only thing i was reading was how people didnt want us to be there
235328 i really wanted to join the marines after 9 11
235329 i wanted to help out in some way and felt compelled to enlist my brother is in the marines and served in afghanistan at the time so thats why i felt drawn to the marines more than any other military branch
235330 i wanted to speak out and tell people what was really going on over there
235331 and i felt that vets for freedom which was founded by combat veterans was the best avenue to push this cause
235332 what i want to do is take our message down to the local level so people who dont watch the national media get a chance to hear our message
235333 i was overwhelmed by an outpouring of emotions from the iraqi people thanking us for what we were doing and begging us to do even more
235334 to have parents come up to me on the streets and thank me for what we were doing and seeing people sacrifice their safety by telling us where the bad guys were made me want to come back to america and tell people what is really going on
235335 our mission is to educate the american people about the importance of achieving success in both iraq and afghanistan by applying our firsthand knowledge to the issues of strategy in american politics
235336 we have a history of supporting candidates on both sides of the aisle basically we want the american people to know that it is extremely important for us to succeed in iraq and afghanistan and that it should not be such a partisan issue
235337 i think that we will see success when iraqis can go to the voting booths and to police stations to sign up without having suicide bombers blow them up
235338 we see that iraq now accounts for 75 percent of its own spending and there are over 540 000 members in the iraqi armed forces i dont think we are too far off from fully achieving success at the same time we do need to be concerned about the terrorists we dont want to just leave iraq and have these terrorists running rampant in the country
235339 we dont want to see terrorist organizations come in and take over the government then harbor other terrorists which may pose an even bigger threat to national security
235340 we have seen some of the violence levels drop dramatically this past year
235341 when you look back at the beginning of the surge and where the iraqi government and military was and how many terrorist organizations we had in the country and compare these to today these are measurements of success
235342 we are not a 527 group and we are not here to elect any candidate
235343 as veterans it is and always will be our job to protect the american people
235344 the iraqi people are extremely grateful for what we have done and this message has been misconstrued by the media
235345 if people would understand the importance of this issue they would understand that we need to achieve success in iraq and afghanistan
235346 this is not a political issue nor is it a partisan issue to make it either one is extremely demeaning not only to the vets who have fought there but to the family and friends of those who did not make it home
235347 we felt that it is important if he is going to run for president he should go to iraq and see the success that has happened since the surge two months later he did just that

235373 darwinism is no longer merely a scientific theory but an ideology an ideology is an all encompassing worldview that attempts to explain everything often on the basis of a single principle such as natural selection moreover it demands complete obedience from our hearts and minds
235374 darwinism is out creation story and such a story always controls how we interpret reality
235375 w e have darwinism but not keplerism we encounter darwinists but no one describes himself as an einsteinian
235376 our natural tendency it would seem is to believe the world is designed
235377 intelligent design is so important because the evidence for it is compelling but darwinists suppress that evidence to promote a naturalistic worldview

235584 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

235666 it is reflective of the failure of political will across the board on everything that has to do with darfur and sudan
235667 it means a way of responding timely to incidents as they occur around the darfur region and the troops can respond rapidly to incidents when they are developing
235668 it is becoming very difficult to help darfuris on the ground who are suffering from continual attacks
235669 people who are familiar with operations in iraq and afghanistan would know that the lives of soldiers and civilians and chances of surviving from injuries improve dramatically with access to helicopters
235670 the member states of the security council and especially the p5 britain france russia china and the u s have authorised the icc to investigate the killing in sudan theyve authorised the hybrid protection force theyve authorised ambassador salim to launch a peace process that would conclude with an agreement for sudan
235671 in each case however when required to provide back up efforts it failed and the failure to provide helicopters has direct consequences for the people on the ground and for the peacekeepers
235672 no heavy lift helicopters have been transferred or provided making it impossible for the force to be mobile confront aggression or even defend itself
235673 since january first according to the secretary general 190 000 darfuris have been displaced and nine people have lost their lives
235674 from the perspective of the coalition it is outrageous that the members of the security council send troops into a conflict zone without the minimum of the equipment needed to protect themselves
235675 i encourage european governments and the united states to come forward and tell the world what theyve got available and what they can make available
235676 if the international community is serious about fulfilling its responsibility to protect civilians in darfur it can start by providing the basics that unamid urgently needs
235677 such support could have saved some of those peacekeepers who died this month gallantly trying to protect civilians the least we can do in their memory is to make sure that no more civilians or peacekeepers perish because of resource constraints

235683 singapore a nation that is considered to be first world has carefully cultivated an image of freedom and progressiveness but the practical reality is that singapores government is authoritarian and resistant to popular sovereignty and as such it censures anyone who advocates democracy and greater freedom

235726 the wage gap is most severe for women of color its absolutely inexcusable that women and especially minority women earn a fraction of what men earn from the same job african american women earn just 63 cents on the dollar and latinas earn far worse at 57 cents the wide disparity begins at the start of a womans work life and grows wider as women age in the long term combined with the decrease in pension income and social security benefits which is what happens many women are at risk of falling into poverty as they get older because this disparity began when they first started working h r 1338 takes immediate steps to close the wage gap for all women by amending and strengthening the equal pay act

235755 it appears that our anti spam filters caused some blogger accounts to be blocked from creating new posts
235756 while we are still investigating we believe this may have been caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression

235790 cuando han concluido las obras y se est procediendo al traslado paulatino del personal de los distintos servicios municipales el equipo de gobierno ha anunciado que abandona la idea de continuar con la puesta en marcha de la guarder a laboral en el seminario porque va a destinar ese espacio a otros usos

235798 estar sembrando el germen de lo que tras el 15 de septiembre deber empezar a ser una nueva conciencia mundial sobre el agua y el planeta
235799 lo que supone un nuevo desfase en el proyecto del seminario que no hab a sido contabilizado hasta el momento
235800 ser necesario planificar y ejecutar otros trabajos para reubicar al organismo ebr polis que actualmente tambi n tiene su sede en el edificio el cubo
235801 por qu no se incluyeron en el proyecto original cuando ya nos anunciaron hace dos a os que ambos organismos se trasladar an al seminario tanto empe o ha tenido belloch en ir ocultando su mayor chapuza cuando va anunciando por fasc culos los diferentes desfases
235802 el paradigma del despilfarro socialista de la mala gesti n y del desprecio con el que el alcalde belloch dilapida los recursos de los zaragozanos
235803 lo que no es nada con el esc ndalo que supone una obra que iba a costar 50 millones de euros se haya incrementado en casi 25 millones
235804 en total llevamos cerca de 75 millones que sumados a estos dos millones de nuevos desfases y a la liquidaci n del iva har n que esta obra acabe acerc ndose a los 80 millones de euros
235805 que termine esta sangr a para las arcas municipales y que aclare hasta d nde piensa llegar con este agujero
235806 en cualquier administraci n seria y responsable un desfase del 60 sobre las previsiones iniciales ser a motivo para asumir unas responsabilidades pol ticas sin embargo el alcalde sigue utilizando la t cnica del avestruz escondi ndose constantemente para disimular este desastre
235807 no es necesario modificar un espacio de 50 000 metros cuadrados y si se hace es porque hay otras necesidades que no est n lo suficientemente explicadas
235808 est tomando decisiones econ micas con este edificio que hace que se dispare continuamente el coste del proyecto del seminario
235809 son decisiones totalmente innecesarias y que hacen que cada d a se incremente m s el coste de la obra

235824 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
235825 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
235826 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
235827 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
235828 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
235829 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
235830 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
235831 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
235832 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
235833 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors

235840 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
235841 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
235842 the next game in the doom universe is in development
235843 we do have the core of the team working on it under the direction of kevin cloud
235844 we are working on what the story is going to be for the game right now the logo shown during quakecon didnt have a four or a subtitle we havent made the decision about that yet there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one
235845 theres going to be big guns lots of blood and demons
235846 thats what we see as the core and thats what that game is about
235847 we are still working on the game and what its going to be about
235848 the goal for the game is that it will be the best game of its ilk when its released
235849 it will remain true to what doom is about this very visceral experience but we still want to obviously be innovative within that

235852 dont you believe in true love anymore what happened to blacken your soul woman
235853 first of all let me say that i do believe in true love but i also deeply believe in the complexity variety and downright insanity of love a lucky person loves hundreds of people in their lives all in different ways family love friendship love romantic love all in so many shades and depths i dont think you lose your ability or right to have true love by loving more than one person in part this is true because you never love two people the same way another part is that if youre lucky you learn to love better with practice the bottom line is that you have to choose who you are going to commit the foundation of true love not a lack of other options

235856 contravenes the spirit of sanctions handed down by members of the un security council on iran
235857 that harms the international effort to considerably toughen sanctions against iran
235858 this deal helps iran in a sensitive sector and makes a mockery of the international communitys efforts to isolate a nuclearizing iranian regime
235859 with the violations and crimes committed by the security forces in the west bank as a campaign to restore order it deals with the performance of the security forces in the gaza strip as clear violations of law
235860 the agency expressed its apology and took out the fabricated news report or article when asked but repeated has the same mistakes
235861 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
235862 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
235863 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
235864 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
235865 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
235866 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
235867 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
235868 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
235869 this is a cultural catastrophe a national tragedy there is so little of art of such level in the former soviet union

235886 hay que trabar ahora sin mirar el resultado puede darse un resultado negativo que no es lo que queremos pero que lo positivo sea dar el m ximo crecer como grupo crecer como equipo y que el objetivo nuestro es el 31 de agosto cuando empiece la liga
235887 hay que sumar la parte f sica y meter un poco dentro de la bolsa para despu s sacar durante el a o

235892 el deportivo es favorito pero no lo tememos en absoluto tenemos nuestras bazas y conf o en un resultado favorable all en la ida
235893 estoy contento porque un rival f cil no nos pudo tocar el deportivo es un buen equipo pero nuestra ventaja podr a ser su inicio tard o del campeonato por lo dem s ya no son el equipo que fueron
235894 ellos son para nosotros un rival atractivo y nosotros para ellos no tanto esto tambi n podr a ser un punto positivo para nosotros espero que en la ida logremos un buen resultado para intentar clasificarnos ante un estadio poljud repleto
235895 creo que el deportivo tiene problemas econ micos y que no invierten mucho si se nos da una coyuntura positiva y los jugadores lo dan todo creo que podemos pasar
235896 por que no hemos de lograr un buen resultado ya en la coru a tenemos potencial para ello
235897 es una pena y muy doloroso perderme los juegos pero debo pensar en mi salud lo pas mal en el tour y he estado enfermo he hecho todo lo posible por acudir a pek n pero el m dico del equipo me aconseja reposo

235919 tambi n es cierto que en la primera sesi n ferrari ha estado ah con ellos por tanto si en esta segunda sesi n ferrari estaba rodando con mucha gasolina ma ana cuando la quiten van a volar o sea que yo no descartar a a ferrari todav a
235920 todav a falta casi la mitad del campeonato y hace tres carreras ferrari hac a primero y segundo en casi todas las pruebas y ahora lo hace mclaren y esto puede cambiar de una carrera a la otra por tanto van a llegar as de t a t hasta el final no creo que nadie d un golpe definitivo hasta m s adelante
235921 se han estudiado las dos opciones hacer una convencional con una primera parte de larga intentando hacer una buena carrera y cogiendo los m ximos puntos posibles o intentando arriesgar en la clasificaci n hacer una buena crono y luego con los dedos cruzados toda la carrera para que no te adelanten muchos coches y coger tambi n los m ximos puntos posible
235922 y esto depende un poco de lo r pido que vayas si vas bien y eres competitivo puedes hacer la opci n arriesgada y que te salga bien si vas lento es un suicidio o sea que si ma ana por la ma ana vamos bien y estamos confiados igual arriesgamos en la crono y si vemos que vamos regul n optaremos por lo m s seguro

235989 at the annual and the climatic 30 year scales gcm interpolated series are irrelevant to reality gcms do not reproduce natural over year fluctuations and generally underestimate the variance and the hurst coefficient of the observed series even worse when the gcm time series imply a hurst coefficient greater than 0 5 this results from a monotonic trend whereas in historical data the high values of the hurst coefficient are a result of large scale over year fluctuations i e successions of upward and downward trends the huge negative values of coefficients of efficiency show that model predictions are much poorer than an elementary prediction based on the time average this makes future climate projections at the examined locations not credible whether or not this conclusion extends to other locations requires expansion of the study which we have planned however the poor gcm performance in all eight locations examined in this study allows little hope if any an argument that the poor performance applies merely to the point basis of our comparison whereas aggregation at large spatial scales would show that gcm outputs are credible is an unproved conjecture and in our opinion a false one

235992 why so serious indeed if ever a tagline was perfectly suited to a film and the critical audience adoration of it it would have to be this three word gem created by a marketing superhero for christopher nolans the dark knight the film that currently sits at 1 on the imdb top 250 films of all time and has been proven to cure cancer put an end to all wars and solve erectile dysfunction as with most long underwear films why must superheroes wear tights its not uncommon for the legion of fanboys and girls to take it as a personal affront when confronted with a dissenting opinion yet with the dark knight the seething anger and raging bile thats been ejaculated on dozens if not hundreds of pages of comments all over the interweb far exceeds the typical zealotry critics who refused to swallow the red pill have been treated as enemy combatants about coms j rgen fauth and the house next doors keith uhlich both friends i should add are two such critics neither of their reviews was intended to provoke nor were they playing the contrarian they simply didnt like the film as of this writing there are 938 comments in response to these reviews some go no deeper than fag some are actually amusing keep your head in little women and suffrage texts you pansy the dark knight well david edelstein and keith uhlich might have some thoughts on that i have not yet seen the film myself and though i very much appreciated batman begins christopher nolans first foray into gotham city geography i find it strange how predigested the anticipation has been about this blockbuster so much so that fans who hadnt even seen the film yet were roasting edelstein for not rubber stamping their excitement and the other pre release raves and of course those that had seen it and took exception to a dissenting view let both edelstein and uhlich know just how unqualified they were as reviewers because of their opinions the commenters are essentially pissed off at these guys for taking this movie seriously something which i suppose would be okay if their own views on it were being validated does a spectacular with a 185 million production budget probably at least that much in an advertising budget and a record breaking opening weekend really need such a vehement hypersensitive defense

236257 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
236258 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
236259 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
236260 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
236261 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
236262 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
236263 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
236264 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
236265 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
236266 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
236267 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
236268 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
236269 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
236270 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
236271 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
236272 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
236273 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
236274 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
236275 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
236276 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
236277 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
236278 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
236279 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
236280 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
236281 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
236282 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
236283 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
236284 who are open to doing something on the production side
236285 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
236286 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
236287 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
236288 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
236289 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
236290 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
236291 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
236292 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
236293 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
236294 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
236295 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
236296 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
236297 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
236298 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
236299 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
236300 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
236301 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
236302 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
236303 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
236304 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
236305 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
236306 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
236307 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
236308 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
236309 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
236310 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
236311 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
236312 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
236313 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
236314 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
236315 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
236316 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
236317 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
236318 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
236319 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
236320 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
236321 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
236322 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
236323 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
236324 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
236325 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
236326 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
236327 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
236328 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
236329 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
236330 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
236331 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
236332 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
236333 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
236334 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
236335 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
236336 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
236337 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
236338 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
236339 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
236340 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
236341 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
236342 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
236343 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
236344 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
236345 jen continues to be more public in her relationship with john than she has with anybody ever
236346 steve was probably a little remorseful for what happened and was trying to apologize
236347 we havent had much time to talk about it but it will be dealt with internally
236348 i think anytime something like that happens you are disappointed
236349 im not going to deal with this in the media
236350 those are possibilities we dont know exactly what is going to happen the focus still needs to be on what this team needs to do you are going to lose guys one way or the other through the season and true test is how we respond to it
236351 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
236352 i dont anticipate this having any lingering affect on this team
236353 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there

236364 when are those that are running state governement going to come up with an aggressive jobs policy in illinois that will keep and create jobs across the state
236365 when a public school fails parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
236366 okay so they are admittedly faux but i mean come on visibility is visibility and how else is lv gonna crack the heavy metal set they should just send him some real ones and be honored that a hardcore dude like navarro is into their brand
236367 we have no doubt that this copying has been willful and is intended to trade upon the fame and cachet of the lv trademarks to elevate the status of the infringing guitar strap and of janes addiction

236373 it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be
236374 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
236375 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
236376 the commission did not intend for the internet policy statement to serve as rules
236377 commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
236378 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory
236379 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated

236384 they have never been properly reproduced but weve recovered the original information that was there
236385 if you put headphones on with those recordings you are right in the middle of the room you hear the whole ambience
236386 i think what weve got is what they were listening to at the time
236387 the flight management computer has a lot of performance data and so forth it doesnt have the same thing that a flight data recorder would have but we will take anything we can get as far as speeds and that sort of thing groundspeeds out of a flight management computer
236388 we have no idea whether one of them is more important than the other at this time so were looking at the weather were looking at the airplane were looking at the flight crews were looking at all aspects to try to find the cause
236389 these gentlemen were valued for their camaraderie as well as their professional expertise the loss of their friendship and that of karen sandland of tishman construction will be keenly felt by all of us here

236395 the hospitalisation suffering or death of even one child from a vaccine preventable disease is an unnecessary human tragedy
236396 at the moment the government is the employer and liable but we are working out a formula so doctors take responsibility for costs
236397 we will impose that so doctors are more responsible knowing they will be taken to account for their actions
236398 if you are negligent pay the costs because that will make doctors more accountable
236399 i have to frankly say that this is the fault of the talatala who is practising grog drinking until the early hours of the morning within his home and in the villages what kind of example is he setting for the youths
236400 once they start drinking kava they want to follow that with a wash down and start drinking heavily and in that intoxicated state they fall into crime they damage property fight and sometimes these drinking sprees end tragically in murder
236401 how can they drink kava within the church compounds they are serving a holy god and yet they are practising a dirty habit its a shame that many of the youths in prison belong to the methodist church and who are they kidding declaring a tabu or abstaining from drinking kava for three months or a year
236402 exams are coming up and we dont want to affect the students learning environment
236403 the students interest will not be compromised so the health inspectors are at the school to sort out the issue
236404 if the school fails to comply within 16 days qvs faces a closure but we hope the solution will be an amicable one and that the students learning environment
236405 at this stage all i can say is we will not close down the school and we are attending to the notice
236406 wir werden uns sachlich mit der thematik auseinandersetzen und sie nach der sommerpause mit der fdp vorsitzenden birgit homburger und dem stellvertretenden ministerpr sidenten ulrich goll besprechen

236411 dass wir nicht in der lage sein sollen noch l nger zusammenzuarbeiten
236412 its nothing new we normally receive rumours or news of things breakouts like that
236413 its all part of the security system there was nothing sinister about it
236414 surely this incident creates a doubt on the competency of the graduates to the public
236415 they are therefore responsible for their own problems of paper leakages and they deal with it
236416 we hope those coming out of fsm are qualified to handle patients and not buying qualifications
236417 this is ensured through the intern programs even dental students are given another year to ensure they are competent enough to handle patients
236418 his body was discovered after he failed to turn up to work he was home alone at that time

236425 our death rate from cancers is related to late stages of presentation and often limited intervention options on treatment

236427 with thy head anointed with holy oil as kings priests and prophets were anointed as solomon was anointed king and nathan the prophet were anointed so be anointed blessed and consecrated king over the people who the lord thy god has given thee to rule and govern
236428 by this anointing pour down upon his head and heart the blessing of the holy spirit and prosper the work of his hands
236429 with the assistance of his heavenly grace may he govern and preserve the people permitted to his charge in wealth peace and godliness and after a long and glorious course of ruling a central kingdom wisely justly and religiously you may last be made partaker of the eternal kingdom through the same jesus christ our lord

236432 elections next year is the way forward and the international community also supports this
236433 it has to be a reflection of the parliament and a reflection of the people it must go through the parliamentary process there is no other way
236434 the interim regime is letting the constitution remain and i am happy that its still intact i believe the interim government should use it
236435 i respect the commodores views that elections will not take place next year from his standpoint but speaking from my own standpoint i believe elections should take place he said
236436 the positions have been vacant for six to 12 months and filling of senior posts will have a significant positive impact on nltb
236437 the process and evaluation of applications and interviews are being done in line with nltb board policy
236438 the tongans regard the kings body as taboo and they are not allowed to touch it because im a very distant relation to him he asked me if i would do the anointing of his head and the crowning
236439 it was a privilege but also a very humble experience
236440 there were 10 medals given to people who made significant contributions to the life here i think because i was doing the crowning i was given a medal
236441 i feel proud and this is a great achievement for me and my sister we are grateful to the hibiscus committee for such an opportunity and i am thankful to my sister for motivating me to be part of this
236442 i just hope to learn a lot from the exposure and the experience and i am looking forward to it
236443 the course teaches us about how to master the different sports and teaches us to become good trainers it is my aim to improve and develop local sports here
236444 we are the rightful owners of that piece of land
236445 by the time they get to school they are already tired and worn out and it is hard for them to grasp what is being taught in the classroom
236446 we are grateful to the variety childrens charity of new zealand which donated a four wheel drive
236447 the vehicle will make it easier for us to pick and drop the students everyday and also pick teachers when they get back from their break
236448 there is a different level of anticipation evident in the changing room compared to last season
236449 there were issues we agreed with them and we were able talk things through we have allowed residents to put their rubbish bags outside their gate if they wont be at home at time of collection this does not mean they can put rubbish by the road as before but we want it near their locked gates
236450 second we have allowed the residents to give a maximum of five bags for green waste
236451 the committee is always making a commitment to the hospital it was their words not ours
236452 we want the authorities responsible to fix the problem because this is a health hazard
236453 there are many families living in this area and the sometimes the smell is unbearable
236454 history of united states decision making on vietnam 1945 1968
236455 dont wait until the new war has started in iran or iraq in the past
236456 and do it at risk to your own clearances your careers these are not light risks but theres a wars worth of lives at stake
236457 laws that apply to the rest of us dont apply to the president he is beyond the law
236458 well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy
236459 uphold the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic
236460 you must leave this office at least as powerful as when you entered it
236461 to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stood
236462 o let america be america again the land that never has been yet and yet must be
236463 o yes i say it plain america never was america to me
236464 we decided to put in for the expenses and fix the road ourselves because waiting for the road department to fix the road might be delayed as there are many channels to follow in the government
236465 the farmers didnt mind raising some money and giving from their own pockets to fix the roads which is in a better condition now
236466 the farmers had no choice but to fix the road otherwise lorry drivers would not want to drive through the area because of the bad road condition
236467 we also had a book drive where the children donated a book each
236468 throughout the week parents have being coming in to discuss the progress of their children
236469 we are encouraging parents and teachers to work together because it pre school is the foundation of their education and we cannot work alone
236470 the new facility is expected to be completed within 12 weeks
236471 this new venture also provides space and capabilities to service private and corporate aircraft using fiji for a dedicated or transit stopover
236472 a diamond um dos maiores fornecedores de plataformas de perfura o mar tima do mundo com posi o de destaque no brasil h mais de 30 anos
236473 as plataformas ser o utilizadas para iniciar a campanha explorat ria da ogx na bacia de campos a partir do segundo semestre de 2009 conforme originalmente planejado
236474 como poder executivo essas resolu es ser o levadas em conta
236475 neste momento eu opinaria contra se algumas resolu es da corte eleitoral tiverem mais poder que uma lei aprovada pelo congresso nacional isso teria de ser estudado esperamos que as resolu es da cne sempre sejam usadas na legalidade e fundamentalmente em aspectos de legitimidade e democracia
236476 mais uma prova da boa avalia o do governo lula
236477 porque elei o municipal n o foi feita para se discutir o governo lula mas principalmente para politizar a sociedade
236478 nacionalmente aprovamos a alian a com psdb democratas e pps mas deixamos para os diret rios regionais decidirem de acordo com as realidades locais
236479 a melhor estrat gia a milit ncia acredito em pesquisas mas o jogo pode ser revertido o judson cabral tem chances a melhor prova de nossa probidade administrativa a reduzida inje o financeira nas campanhas se comparadas com algumas outras candidaturas
236480 vamos evitar ao m ximo os conflitos repudiando hostilidades muito importante que exista essa disputa pelo uso da imagem do presidente lula isso uma prova de que ele faz um bom governo
236481 nossa vinda a macei faz parte da campanha do pt brasil afora pelo voto consciente a lei quem nos traz impedimentos mas o pt autoriza a veicula o da imagem do presidente salvo quando os diret rios regionais solicitam exclusividade tendo em vista que alguns candidatos o fazem apenas com fins eleitoreiros mas n o creio que esta liberdade possa causar algum desgaste a n o ser que haja pr disposi o para tal
236482 esta a maior prova de nossa probidade administrativa valorizamos o que temos de melhor que a nossa milit ncia por que hoje a sociedade se pergunta de onde vem o dinheiro quem financia o que v o querer em troca depois
236483 segundo a pesquisa 25 da popula o brasileira prefere o pt com mais de um milh o de filiados enquanto que 54 afirmam n o terem prefer ncia partid ria
236484 teve gente que se elegeu praticamente sem chance no in cio do processo exemplo disto foi a vit ria de jacques wagner na bahia em 2006
236485 o presidente lula j ventilou por diversas vezes o nome da ministra chefe da casa civil dilma roussef mas outros companheiros podem pleitear como o tarso genro ministro da justi a por exemplo
236486 apesar de questionada no aspecto do constrangimento na abordagem a algumas pessoas
236487 tudo o que vemos hoje n o existia at o governo lula e o maior exemplo de que o trabalho feito com isen o que at um prefeito do pt luiz caetano de cama ari na bahia foi preso por fraude em licita es daqui h 20 anos o presidente lula ser lembrando como um dos melhores presidentes deste pa s ao contr rio de muitos outros que tiveram suas passagens marcadas negativamente
236488 a equipe de lugo nos apresentou um memorando extremamente interessante no qual h quest es a discutir de natureza econ mica at quest es jur dicas e obviamente pol ticas sobre itaipu
236489 prudente divulg lo antes que o governo brasileiro o analise
236490 come amos bem come amos com um acordo sobre a metodologia sobre os temas que temos que discutir e esperamos que esse clima positivo que se instalou hoje em dia possa apressar as negocia es que vamos estabelecer sobre itaipu
236491 mesmo assim a situa o financeira da empresa bastante confort vel e o cronograma de amortiza o da d vida est bem distribu do
236492 tudo caminha dentro do que era esperado por n s
236493 para que a compra seja conclu da ainda durante 2008
236494 um bom acordo sempre melhor do que uma demanda desnecess ria eu acho que isso uma coisa extraordin ria fazer acordos com os nossos criadores de gado e dizer que vamos recuperar as terras degradadas e vamos nelas fazer a pol tica de florestamento que tanto a ind stria precisa
236495 melhor para imagem do pa s melhor economicamente para os seus produtos a gente fazer as coisas direito e poder transitar em todos os f runs internacionais de cabe a erguida com a sensa o do dever cumprido
236496 im going to give you the scoop and im going to let people quote your interview
236497 i love your record and you got me through some really tough times
236498 mas o senhor tem que fazer alguma coisa por n s ex presidi rios
236499 avan ar rumo obten o de uma indeniza o justa para os cidad os americanos em seus processos contra o governo l bio
236500 ajudar americanos a fecharem um doloroso cap tulo em suas vidas
236501 h seis anos o doutor bruce ivins cooperava na investiga o e ajudava o governo em qualquer quest o ligada a ela
236502 n o estamos fazendo qualquer coment rio oficial ou emitindo comunicados neste momento
236503 estamos tristes por sua morte e decepcionados que n o teremos a oportunidade de defender seu nome e reputa o num tribunal asseguramos sua inoc ncia nessas mortes e ter amos provado isso num julgamento
236504 ele estava sob muita press o j havia sido interrogado pelo fbi
236505 this is a result of many years of frustration in trying to move forward with trying to provide our patients with treatment options access to innovative surgeries access to clinical trials
236506 as more research becomes available across the country our colleagues moved forward but you know were just having these increasing frustrations with getting these new treatment options off the ground in newfoundland
236507 these people are going through a very vulnerable time in their lives they need their support system we certainly want these patients to be dealt with on home territory thats certainly the most important thing for them
236508 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
236509 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
236510 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved
236511 during these spotless and near minimum flux conditions i have seen the extreme divergence of the day to day propagation paths as a function of the traditional flux numbers allowing for seasonal trends the differences in direction and quality of openings on a given band from day to day where the flux and a and k indices remain nearly unchanged for days the openings generally show much more relationship to the intensity of the solar wind from here the patterns of propagation under the weak stimulation of near minimum flux show much more pronounced linking to the dynamic wind speed and composition than to simple 2800 mhz flux measurements i believe without the positive contribution of the ionospheric bias provided by even a low flux say 80 85 even a small increase in solar wind has a profound effect on the daily paths
236512 put another way the good bad effects upon propagation from minor solar wind changes not associated with flares and cmes are much more observable when the flux is hovering under 68 or so than when it is higher at that time we feel the big effects from the major storms but it is interesting to note the nuances of propagation say by observing the ncdxf hf beacons daily during a quiescent sun
236513 i noticed a forecast on a propagation web site that the geomagnetic field would be unsettled due to a solar boundary crossing i dont recall seeing reference to this phenomenon in any previous forecasts what is this boundary crossing
236514 o que mais me chamou aten o nos postos de sa de da prefeitura que eles n o atendem ao perfil dos bairros a regi o da zona sul concentra a maior popula o idosa da cidade e n o existem m dicos geriatras e fisioterapeutas
236515 quando as pessoas podem registrar um evento que est acontecendo isso ajuda nas investiga es
236516 infelizmente ocorreu uma explos o por g s metano oito deles foram resgatados mas j sem vida dois outros tamb m foram encontrados e enviados ao hospital
236517 os mineradores ilegais n o cumprem com as normas de seguran a e por isso est o sujeitos a este tipo de acidentes
236518 uma pena praticamente indulgente que se transforma em motivo de piada
236519 estranha muito quando se ouve dizer que um traficante pagou uma pena m nima e vai viver como um rei
236520 agora nos preocupa que as negocia es l com os narcotraficantes levem a que imponham uma pena praticamente indulgente
236521 qualquer negocia o que se realize nos estados unidos com os narcotraficantes extraditados pelo menos lhes imponham uma pena m nima severa
236522 a id ia essa excelente n o tem d vida a receita j trabalha h muito tempo e vem evoluindo isso evita o problema da duplicidade se a gente nasce com um n mero e isso for colocado em tudo uma vantagem indiscut vel
236523 a expans o das opera es de financiamento vir acompanhada de aumento de efici ncia operacional e queda na inadimpl ncia
236524 nesses n veis o crescimento de empr stimos nos bancos pode superar nossa proje o de aproximadamente 25 em 2008
236525 isso mesmo levando se em conta que as taxas de inadimpl ncia uma fonte de preocupa o em um cen rio de maiores taxas de juros melhoraram
236526 o in cio do processo de aumento da selic j deve trazer resultados positivos sobre a carteira de t tulos p blicos
236527 injusto o processo e a senten a ilegal e infundada
236528 as irregularidades registradas durante o processo s o escandalosas e degradantes
236529 as acusa es foram fabricadas as provas n o existem e a senten a foi aprovada antes do in cio do processo
236530 eu deveria me retirar n o somente da vida pol tica mas tamb m dos escrit rios do partido e desaparecer completamente da esfera p blica n o dar entrevistas nem publicar trabalhos liter rios em uma palavra permanecer o suficientemente invis vel para que os acordos de dayton se aplicassem totalmente
236531 n o seria julgado perante este tribunal e que deveria entender que durante um tempo haveria uma forte ret rica
236532 est claro que sendo incapaz de cumprir suas promessas holbrooke passou ao plano b a liquida o de radovan karadzic
236533 desconhe o o tamanho do bra o do senhor holbrooke ou se esse bra o pode alcan ar me aqui
236534 n o teria as condi es de um julgamento justo especialmente quando um dos procuradores disse em p blico que eu teria certamente uma condena o de pris o perp tua
236535 a conclus o se baseia em mensagens interceptadas e mantidas entre agentes de intelig ncia paquistaneses e militantes que realizaram o ataque
236536 membros da espionagem do paquist o est o prejudicando os esfor os americanos para combater os militantes na regi o
236537 em alguns casos lhes permitiu evitar os ataques com m sseis dos eua nas reas tribais
236538 precisamos superar este obst culo t cnico sobre o qual paramos

236541 for those new to the mojave experiment its a focus group effort we initiated a few weeks ago we interviewed and polled 120 participants in san francisco in hopes of better understanding everyday users perceptions of windows vista and seeing whether there really is a gap between perception and reality we wanted to see how people reacted to windows vista when they were not aware they were seeing windows vista we recorded our discussions and today you can see them for yourself

236592 it is disgusting to read about the details of the commerical arrangements surrounding the case
236593 this is a result of many years of frustration in trying to move forward with trying to provide our patients with treatment options access to innovative surgeries access to clinical trials
236594 as more research becomes available across the country our colleagues moved forward but you know were just having these increasing frustrations with getting these new treatment options off the ground in newfoundland
236595 these people are going through a very vulnerable time in their lives they need their support system we certainly want these patients to be dealt with on home territory thats certainly the most important thing for them
236596 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
236597 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
236598 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved

236630 traditionally people think linear from cradle to grave which means that at the end the whole earth will be a graveyard because we lose all the material we have a lot of energy put on this planet but we dont have material input except maybe some meteorites but in this context we need to think about how to make material products that they go back into nutrient cycles forever and we distinguish between two cycles things which get consumed like food like detergents like shoe soles like brake pads are designed to be biological nutrients right now australia looses about 5000 times more topsoil that is regained per time unit and so we need to rebuild soil to be able to feed all the people on this planet thats a biological cycle and the technical cycle are things like washing machines tv sets etc you dont consume them you only use them theyre technical nutrients so you cannot design a tv set without heavy metals i have been analysing a radio and i identified 2800 different chemicals in a radio yet do we really want to own toxic waste or do you just want to listen to good radio programs like this one for example and then you see you dont want to own toxic waste you only want to have a service but these materials are rare and they are toxic so they need to be able to be designed to go back in a technical nutrient cycle so this is cradle to cradle

236643 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
236644 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
236645 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
236646 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

236653 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
236654 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
236655 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
236656 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
236657 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
236658 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
236659 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
236660 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab
236661 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
236662 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
236663 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
236664 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
236665 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
236666 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
236667 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
236668 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
236669 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
236670 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
236671 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
236672 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
236673 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
236674 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
236675 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
236676 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
236677 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
236678 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
236679 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
236680 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
236681 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
236682 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
236683 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
236684 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
236685 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
236686 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
236687 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
236688 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
236689 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
236690 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
236691 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
236692 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
236693 there was not an increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with regular consumption of orange juice grapefruit juice or diet soft drinks in our study
236694 so much attentions given to obesity that marketers are naturally trying to market towards a healthier consumer base
236695 light juice blends have fewer calories but are high on artificial sweeteners that heighten the palate for sweet things void of nutritional value
236696 four ounces is the quantity of juice that children and adults should consume per day
236697 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
236698 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
236699 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
236700 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
236701 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
236702 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
236703 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
236704 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
236705 i watched it grow when it looked like it was going to be a weed
236706 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
236707 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
236708 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
236709 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
236710 ive no memory for it its just one of those things you know the more days i put between then and now the more distant it gets even now it doesnt seem like a part of this album it seems more like an excuse why this album was delayed
236711 i found this really beautiful instrument that kind of dictated the way the songs would sound
236712 i had all the parts but no connection i didnt know how to finish it
236713 put me into this childlike place where i didnt have to front or have to explain i just sat at the piano and drums and played
236714 trying to cover life cover everything to do with war and life and living and loving the whole thing and fate and peace
236715 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
236716 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
236717 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
236718 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
236719 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
236720 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
236721 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
236722 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
236723 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
236724 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
236725 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
236726 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
236727 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
236728 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
236729 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
236730 it seems that in the media to some extent hes being blamed for every bicycle thats disappeared in the last many many years in toronto
236731 it would appear the response is a bit overblown by the public
236732 its early and i think the judge just wants to respect his rights to speak to counsel and hes giving him that opportunity
236733 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that
236734 i know he was from edmonton i dont know why he was on the bus thats still under investigation
236735 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
236736 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
236737 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
236738 he was a great neighbor always quick to help out if you needed anything
236739 he was not one of those people who was reclusive and stuck to himself he wasnt that kind of person
236740 that he would be implicated in any kind of way with the anthrax letters and so forth is a tremendous shock
236741 one car would pull up and the other would pull away
236742 theyd be around all the time and then disappear for days so wed try to keep track of who was gone or on vacation then
236743 we know bruce worked in the big anthrax lab so we started think maybe this has something to do with him
236744 at first i thought it was in front of my house
236745 the trucks lights were off and there were no sirens
236746 this is a result of many years of frustration in trying to move forward with trying to provide our patients with treatment options access to innovative surgeries access to clinical trials
236747 as more research becomes available across the country our colleagues moved forward but you know were just having these increasing frustrations with getting these new treatment options off the ground in newfoundland
236748 these people are going through a very vulnerable time in their lives they need their support system we certainly want these patients to be dealt with on home territory thats certainly the most important thing for them
236749 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
236750 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
236751 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved

236812 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

236833 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
236834 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
236835 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation

236837 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along

236843 the american ambassador to the united nations in the middle of the 1970s daniel patrick moynihan has thus congratulated himself in his memoirs for having rendered
236844 instead of simply utilizing nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence they the us will start manufacturing bombs and other devices of mass destruction for the purpose of actually using them and the most important point i believe is that they clearly stated their intention to use those weapons in combat
236845 overwheening even crazy and criminal by what it implies and one that did not come out of president bush juniors head to be implemented by an extreme right junta seizing power through dubious elections
236846 it is the project which the ruling class of the united states has unceasingly nurtured since 1945 even though its implementation evidently passed through ups and downs encountered a few vicissitudes and was here and there checked and could be not be pursued with the consistency and violence that this implied in certain conjunctural moments like that following the disintegration of the soviet union
236847 the objective of us global policy is not just power for its own sake but the
236848 it is notably in the middle east and surrounding the question of palestine that the united states has systematically instituted impunity in the face of violations of international law
236849 when i speak before american university students i say this to them if i were to write a book called the american empire for dummies page one would say dont ever look for the moral factor us foreign policy has no moral factor built into its dna clear your mind of that baggage which only gets in the way of seeing beyond the clich s and the platitudes they feed us
236850 military necessity does not admit of the inflicting of suffering for the sake of suffering or revenge nor of wounding except in fight nor of torture to extort confessions it does not admit of the use of poison in any way or of the wanton devastation of a district art 16
236851 such a felt sense of political responsibility for empires actions by its citizens is dependent on viewing oneself not as an innocent or impotent bystander but rather as an implicated agent
236852 do have a responsibility to act to resist empire this is based on an analysis of the impunity of empire for it is the idea that there is a nonreciprocal right of empire to run roughshod over everyone else in the name of spreading its own values and its own conception of security globally one of the essential hallmarks of empires law that must be contested
236853 ethically motivated and informed global action has no adequately global instruments
236854 what the american empire fears and i think rightly is that such strategies may contribute to our capacities to become the strong my claim is that such politically inspired attempts litigating against american empire under international humanitarian law may contribute to the goals of cultivating a sense of poitical responsibility while both depending on political action for their broad effectivity and contributing to further political action
236855 oh youdre eyes are blue i really wanna talk to you
236856 power may be spotty in some areas but overall the island is back on its feet
236857 we want to thank aep and its hard working crews for all theyve done for us
236858 we welcome our tourists back to south padre island but we ask you to pardon our dust
236859 our warm sandy beaches are open and the weathers fantastic
236860 we will continue with our usual friday fireworks display and it will be a special one
236861 the display will symbolize south padres grand re opening and resilience after a rather difficult time this is your island and we want you to enjoy it with us
236862 eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
236863 you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free
236864 the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him
236865 the world cannot judge you when you are walking in the spirit of truth
236866 that little boy from bain town who does he think he is
236867 they did not hire me and they cannot fire me if i am released it is because god does not want me to be employed here at this time he wants me to be deployed i am going to step into a higher level of living
236868 if that was really the son of god and he really died for me then i felt compelled to get on my knees and worship him
236869 up until that point my prayer life was like a child talking to santa claus making deals with god saying ill be good but this is what i want in return
236870 which god do you have to thank for your safety
236871 in a monotheistic home with a firm belief in a god with traditional values the same sort of values you find in the ten commandments and other mainstream religions
236872 not a faith that was necessarily tied to a particular historical scripture or revelation
236873 i did not have an overnight epiphany like so many people do
236874 given my background and personality that was an important part of the process
236875 i dont think you can read yourself into faith i had gotten to the point where i knew what history had to say about this person named jesus and what he had done on earth i think at some point you have to take a leap of faith
236876 i dont know why i was struck so hard at that moment
236877 there was nothing fascinating about this particular video but watching this depiction of an actor playing jesus on the cross it just hit me harder than id ever been hit before
236878 if that was really the son of god and he really died for me then i felt compelled to get on my knees and worship him
236879 up until that point my prayer life was like a child talking to santa claus making deals with god saying ill be good but this is what i want in return
236880 it was like the words were jumping out of the page it was literally as if it had been written just for me
236881 i didnt know how theyd accept it i wanted to make sure they didnt view it as a rejection of them that i still loved them and still shared many of the values they instilled in us
236882 i dont think i can do that im not catholic
236883 there is hope in what he represents that an immigrant can hold the highest seat in state government who doesnt look like the average american whats disappointing though is at what expense does it take turning your back on your tradition to your community
236884 ive always thought that each of us as an individual should make our own decisions
236885 i think it is unfortunate that so often in modern society we tend to try to group people by stereotypes and hyphenated identifications
236886 its all plastic tubing and its been glued ill have to cut it to find the blockage
236887 mon dieu if it was like this everyday id never have stayed a plumber quelle catastrophe
236888 this is supposed to be connected to the town sewage system
236889 defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won a historic precedent for an open internet
236890 we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
236891 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
236892 for now at least the vagueness of the fccs net neutrality principles can be useful to both sides broadband providers and free press can point to them as supporting their respective positions if a court declares them to be unlawful the ruling could invite more specific regulations or explicit legislation from congress
236893 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
236894 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
236895 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
236896 sources close to the situation at one of taiwans top motherboard makers
236897 the loss of its chipset business is expected to have a significant impact on nvidias gpu business in the short term
236898 continues to be challenged by significant competitive and pricing pressures in its core gpu business and that street estimates
236899 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
236900 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
236901 has a permanent white patch of hair on the back of his head that is difficult to conceal
236902 his interests are in sailing physics and art he frequents libraries he reports that he was home schooled and may tell others that reigh is home schooled he also may have cut and dye her hair and be dressing her in boys clothing
236903 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
236904 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
236905 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
236906 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
236907 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
236908 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
236909 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
236910 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
236911 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
236912 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
236913 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
236914 because what sen obama was saying was that hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates and he understands that and he understands that that will be a source of contention but in no way did he say that
236915 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
236916 this is not the john mccain voters thought they would be seeing in this presidential campaign
236917 hes not just embracing the rove playbook that people really are tired of hes taking it to a further extreme
236918 this karl rove style ploy misleads people about baracks energy plan and even mocks his ability to inspire voters and bring americans back into the political process
236919 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
236920 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
236921 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
236922 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
236923 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
236924 in short comcast was not simply blocking their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
236925 the fcc is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and commitment for life
236926 we recognize that protecting internet openness is like protecting the internets immune system
236927 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
236928 we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
236929 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies
236930 mourned the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist we will miss him very much
236931 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
236932 are seen not only as luxury objects but also as an important business tool and thats a rare combination
236933 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as
236934 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
236935 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
236936 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
236937 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks
236938 for mac os x v10 4 11 systems bind is updated to version 9 3 5 p1 for mac os x v10 5 4 systems bind is updated to version 9 4 2 p1
236939 is apple modifying the bind distributions from isc and somehow didnt realize this repercussion or is there some kind of configuration file that they forgot to change it must be one of those two
236940 if you take the bind distribution from isc and patch your system on a linux box youre patched
236941 brings to an end uncertainties and costs of a complex dispute but in no way carries any acknowledgement of responsibility
236942 we have noted the interest of the venezuelan government in the banco de venezuela and are in talks at this time to that effect
236943 santander had planned to sell this bank to a group of private venezuelan investors an operation for which certain commitments had been made although no no final agreement had been reached
236944 were going to nationalise bank of venezuela im calling on banco santander to come and start negotiating
236945 they wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan banker and as head of state im saying no sell it to the government to the state
236946 they are talking they are negotiating and they are going to reach an agreement
236947 we have closed a chapter and are opening have opened another chapter and i am certain that after the reconciliation better times are ahead
236948 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
236949 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal
236950 telling the difference between severe storms in general and the particular ones that produce tornadoes thats the most difficult thing to do
236951 what we did is sort of the low hanging fruit
236952 trying to separate out this frequency of severe thunderstorms from the frequency of tornadoes explicitly is much higher in the tree
236953 we were reacting to what barack obama himself said about john mccain
236954 and i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics and i think that was fair well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist weve seen this happen before and weve not going to let it happen to us
236955 he said it to a crowd in rural missouri 99 percent white
236956 there were all kinds of press there nobody reported it as a racial comment nobody certainly said what rick davis just said that he called john mccain a racist the only time this became an issue was when rick davis and their campaign decided to kick it up and make it a racial issue and thats exactly what theyve been running a negative campaign for weeks
236957 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
236958 my arms hurt my arms hurt i was a p o w i am a hero ask anybody
236959 view obama as a pretender who talks about change but has not been willing to cross his party or any important constituencies as a senator
236960 feel the rhythm feel the rhyme get on up its charm song time coooool runnings
236961 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
236962 we discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else
236963 but this was discussed before the first heart transplant and in reality nobody really cared about that
236964 it is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation the higher it is the harder it is
236965 will manage this type of situation more efficiently in the future we apologize for any confusion or frustration this change may have caused
236966 its an example of a publisher treating e book retailers and readers as second class citizens
236967 unimaginable to many people that this court could now acquit me
236968 speed is essential to the calculations of a gunslinger but not at all in matters of law and justice
236969 not appear in public or on radio or television or other media or participate in any way in the elections
236970 they did not even let me send a single sms message
236971 its a little bit baffling i know they need the money but the symbolism of where hes going and what hes doing just reeks of why american voters want change
236972 if the democrats wish to take this opportunity to rehash statements made 18 years ago and use race for their own selfish political posturing then their priorities during this election season are out of line
236973 this facility is also much easier from a security standpoint which can be tricky when putting on this type of event and this cuts our cost

237002 the experience of being in the chase in 06 helped me so much in 07

237012 adebayor is an arsenal player and will play for arsenal next season
237013 for me there has been no trouble because when a player is a true professional he goes onto the pitch and tries to play the football he loves
237014 what is very damaging sometimes is that the player gets bad publicity against his own fans for things he has not said that is sometimes difficult to repair there is disappointment from the fans because they feel the player wants to go

237054 i think the house should continue trying to pass legislation to improve our national energy policies
237055 regrettably so far our repeated efforts to do that have been thwarted by the refusal of our friends on the other side of the aisle to support any of the proposals that have been considered

237075 the informant noted that the complainants hair seemed to be cut unevenly to her ear as if it had been chopped off

237081 we are considering and actively exploring alternatives that may close this gap and want to assure investors we will listen to their thoughts
237082 the lack of specifics coupled with the dolan familys well documented unpredictability was interpreted by analysts to mean that everything is on the table

237096 we have better things to do than contribute more time to this issue
237097 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
237098 theyre getting bolder doing almost anything to get the shot
237099 the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control it needs to be reined in
237100 without knowing who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
237101 a severe accident occurring from this kind of vehicular pursuit is not a theoretical possibility
237102 if i were someone who wanted to do harm to a celebrity of which there are many my best in succeeding today would be to hold a camera
237103 i dont sit before you today asking you to ban the paparazzi im asking you to regulate it
237104 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
237105 he doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
237106 i just cant understand what motivated the chief to attack me for trying to give the police department the tools to address this problem
237107 what does lindsay lohan going gay or not gay have to do with paparazzi
237108 whos a celebrity you me by definition we all think we are celebrities
237109 nothing is going to happen with this issue i can guarantee it
237110 to date we have had little response from the public to our appeals but this is understandable considering the limited information available for release somebody out there holds the key to this investigation ask yourself if anyone you know has been acting unusually or out of character since friday july 18 or saturday july 19 if you do then do not hesitate to come forward and tell us i continue to urge anyone who has any information about this incident to contact suffolk police

237121 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
237122 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
237123 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
237124 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
237125 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
237126 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
237127 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
237128 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
237129 whats wrong with your dad i think hes really nice
237130 ya know i never did learn how to speak polish but ive learned a bunch of the lyrics from listening to you sing ive been listening to your music since i was a kid

237132 how bout we walk a mile down the road to the anchor inn
237133 what would you buy for yourself if we win the lotto
237134 what charitable acts would you do for others with your money
237135 for wisdom is far more valuable than rubies nothing you desire can be compared with it
237136 do not judge or you too will be judged 2for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you
237137 i think the us financial system is basically sound i truly do
237138 since 1951 the budget of the department of defense each year exceeds the net profits of all u s corporations so in finance capital terms that means that the management of that budget controls the largest single block of finance capital resources
237139 the first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency the second is war both bring a temporary prosperity both bring a permanent ruin but both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists
237140 foreign dollar investors have been taxed by the american feds policy of benign neglect regarding the dollar
237141 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
237142 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
237143 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
237144 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
237145 the panic of last year is over its more orderly now but the financial stresses remain and there will be more difficulties to come
237146 the asset backed outstanding continues to creep a little lower
237147 no one is willing to touch the asset backed commercial paper because people are concerned about the intrinsic value of the underlying issues mortgage related securities
237148 most groups have ended because 1 they joined the political process or 2 local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups
237149 that cannot or will not make a transition to nonviolence policing is likely to be the most effective strategy
237150 a fter september 11 2001 the u s strategy against al qaida centered on the use of military force
237151 u s policymakers and key national security documents referred to operations against al qaida as the war on terrorism emphasis in original
237152 the evidence by 2008 suggested that the u s strategy is not possible
237153 resurgence should trigger a fundamental rethinking of u s counterterrorism strategy
237154 policing and intelligence should be the backbone of u s efforts
237155 military force may be a necessary instrument when is involved in an insurgency
237156 they have a better understanding of the operating environment even if they need to develop the capacity to deal with insurgent groups over the long run this means a light u s military footprint or none at all
237157 should include ending the notion of a war on terrorism and replacing it with such concepts as counterterrorism
237158 encourages others abroad to respond by conducting a jihad or holy war against the united states and elevates them to the status of holy warriors terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
237159 suggests that there is no battle eld solution to terrorism military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended it is often over used alienates the local population by its heavy handed nature and provides a window of opportunity for terrorist group recruitment
237160 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
237161 economic political and social development in vulnerable corners of the world
237162 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development
237163 the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
237164 an absence of fundamental conflict between great powers to shape the future and to prevent the re emergence of great power rivalry
237165 how can kerry protect us if he doesnt even understand the threat
237166 we have to take our military dominated war on terror and remake it as the global counterinsurgency campaign that it always should have been
237167 military action was the primary cause of a terrorist group meeting its final demise in just seven percent of the time
237168 i want to live fast love hard die young and leave a beautiful memory

237173 i dont like the idea that it the sale of parkland was done on the quiet
237174 im in the same party as they are but i dont like the corruption
237175 most of these people up here on the county commission belong to secret orders
237176 some of their ceremonies resemble wiccan ones they are less magical and more political
237177 they feel it is their right to control the destiny of other people

237189 he always seemed on the edge the kind of guy who might jump through the ceiling if you said boo to him
237190 almost everybody at riid believes that he has absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
237191 they said they were investigating science relating to anthrax thats all they told me
237192 the los angeles city council has passed an ordinance prohibiting construction of new fast food restaurants in a 32 square mile area inhabited by 500 000 low income people
237193 i think the republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda
237194 you know who wanted us to impeach the president it was the republicans
237195 its quite a risky undertaking to buy a company like that
237196 they have historically been fairly poor performing nuclear plants in the uk
237197 one is the power price might fall but the other is the serious risk that the stations wont work these have a terrible reliability record
237198 were that to accelerate down to sometime next year then it may turn out that bes shareholders and board turned down what in retrospect was an extremely good offer
237199 as long as nobody else is bidding for be what incentives does edf have to overbid
237200 we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
237201 nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
237202 this isnt over by any means because in the end there is no suggestion that edf doesnt want to build new nuclear power stations my guess is that this is just one more step in a long drawn out process
237203 they are the main indeed almost the only source of quick new build there was always going to be some people that will build some stations but edf is absolutely pivotal
237204 most of those companies would be able to move forward with a nuclear power station they may bring in expertise from outside but i dont think thats a complete show stopper for them
237205 i handle the notes no better than many others but the pauses that is where the art resides
237206 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
237207 in remarks to the american federation of teachers last month sen obama dismissed public support for private school vouchers for low income americans as tired rhetoric about vouchers and school choice all of that went over well with the teachers union but where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools
237208 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
237209 i do not and americans have rejected a quota system and that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone and has not helped anyone

237212 thanks for the newsflash baker did you really have to consult your toronto contacts to realize this and what the fuck are you talking about television numbers for yes rogers depends on television numbers on its own station because it sees the jays as little more than a marketing tool but how does that make the numbers less important to teams that need television numbers for direct income
237213 the reports he has given me are firsthand not hearsay
237214 on the financial front todd recently told the crowd that god had told him that there were 1 000 people who would give 1 000 and that they would be blessed 1 000 fold
237215 what i am saying is that we need to back up and not identify ourselves closely with lakeland and that we need to stop repeating claims being made on the air lest we end up getting splattered with the collateral damage when certain issues of false claims publicly by the way no one is saying that some healings have not happened only that many false embellished or unsubstantiated claims have been made a number of really good men champions of revival through the years are actually saying that the whole thing is of the devil and that even the healings are demonically inspired i want to be clear that im not going there
237216 need to back up and meanwhile back to the topic of
237217 an obruni the local twi term for white person or foreigner obruni hair is different its like straw what would she want us to do to it
237218 no you have to fix it i have to give a presentation tomorrow
237219 but madam the obruni her hair is different she insisted we use the product on her hair but it is not meant for her the hair is weak and soft its not our fault
237220 determine the safety and reliability of the nations nuclear weapons stockpile
237221 in short the university functions in some ways like an independent sovereign retaining a degree of control over the terms and scope of its own liability given the universitys unique constitutional status it is not surprising that the legislature would take a deferential approach when authorizing damages actions against the university
237222 t he literal reading of section 8547 10 we adopt today borders on the absurd bringing into possible play the principle that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend
237223 will act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act with respect to university employees
237224 for whistle blowing employees to be confident they are protected against retaliation they must have recourse to a fair and impartial decisionmaking process outside the line management of their employing agency or university if the same government organization that has tried to silence the reporting employee also sits in final judgment of the employees retaliation claim the laws protection against retaliation is illusory

237231 sade did it shes got an opinion your kiss is real
237232 this deck smells like chocolate chip cookies but i wish it smelled like him
237233 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
237234 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
237235 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
237236 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
237237 at this time im not aware of what may have provoked this attack
237238 i can confirm the victim was stabbed and that the victim was pronounced dead at the scene
237239 this is one of the most horrific crimes i have ever heard in my life
237240 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
237241 they walk around too damn cute but they dont serve enough food

237244 there is no greater problem facing average americans and small business today than high fuel costs and our nations dependency on foreign oil
237245 our proposal is not perfect but it is a bipartisan start on the road to a comprehensive energy strategy leading our nation to independence from foreign oil it will create new jobs from new technologies good for american wallets and our environment i am proud to be part of this bipartisan effort to address this serious problem
237246 offshore drilling with the consent of the states is an integral part of any energy independence plan
237247 there is no doubt we need more domestic exploration every barrel of oil we can find in america will be one less we have to compete with china and india for or be subject to opec price setting the more domestic energy we can locate and utilize the better
237248 since the 1970s our country has had an irrational view of nuclear power
237249 this view is best demonstrated by our nations refusal to allow recycling of spent fuel rods for decades the french japanese and british have all been recycling spent fuel surely this is an instance were we can be as bold as the french
237250 our proposal also commits billions for research development and purchases of alternative fuel vehicles
237251 we call for an apollo project like effort to support the goal of transitioning 85 percent of american new motor vehicles to non petroleum based fuels within the next 20 years
237252 quite frankly this particular tax incentive was never asked for by the oil companies
237253 it is irrational to be allocating around 1 billion per year in tax dollars to assist in production at a time when oil is 124 per barrel and companies are recording record profits
237254 it is clear to the american people their congress is broken i appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to try to jumpstart serious discussions on how to solve americas energy crisis
237255 it is my hope that this group will provide some reassurance to the american people that we still can work together and find common ground on the important problems facing every american family and business i hope that over the congressional recess support will build for this common sense balanced approach to making our nation more energy independent

237298 we wanted to add some depth to the bullpen some experience
237299 its a deal we started talking about last weekend and it came together this morning
237300 we felt the opportunity to acquire a young pitcher made sense as we look toward 2009 and beyond
237301 pedro grifol our minor league field coordinator has known gaby for several years and believes he has a chance to help us in the future
237302 ganha mais um momento antol gico onde tamb m presente os efeitos de som cria um momento que pode ser chamado de exibicionista mas o conte do apresentado algo que vale apreciar
237303 anytime you get some rookies to pump some energy in there its great
237304 its great that theyre having fun because thats what you need and its great burkett and palanski are local kids were thrilled with those guys so far
237305 theyre happy to be here and were happy to have them here
237306 theyre guys we can joke around with they keep it loose in the locker room because theyre so young not that im old but they bring a little life to the team
237307 the kids got good stuff a good curve ball great changeup and he can throw two seamers all day the balls 88 miles an hour and it runs in on hitters hes got a fantastic career ahead of him if he stays healthy hes going to get a chance this year and i know hes going to finish up this year strong if theres scouts that come to the game and see that stuff right there maybe theyll take a chance on him
237308 hes just got to learn to throw more strikes 17 walks in 26 innings and then hell be fine hes got to learn to throw more strikes because then his breaking stuff will be that much better
237309 its been a pretty easy transition i think to where i was at in college to here
237310 its a little tougher being in relief whereas at school i was starting you get into a routine and i knew what i was doing every day here you just have to be ready at all times you dont want to throw too much before the game you want to save it for the game get loose quick and get on the mound quick the hitters here they hit mistakes
237311 as a pitcher you want to get back out there after a bad outing
237312 you dont want to have to think about it for a few days it kind of gets into your head a little bit thats the advantage of relieving ive been working on my changeup a lot trying to keep hitters off balance thats been a big pitch for me since i got here
237313 its been awesome talking with guapo the guys a wealth of knowledge and roper pride pitching coach john
237314 hes 88 91 with some heavy sink on the ball and he competes
237315 nothing fazes him out there which is great im sure hes pumped up excited to be pitching for his home crowd
237316 in a summer ball in virginia in the valley league a collegiate league
237317 its awesome to see local guys succeeding at this level around here its just as good a competition as affiliated ball a lot of these guys could have been in triple a a year ago double a a year ago its still great competition
237318 hes similar to me except hes got a lot harder two seamer
237319 we feel good about what were doing right now especially when you win in this fashion a couple days in a row it brings guys right together
237320 i was struggling there at the beginning of the year
237321 i just kept trying to tinker with little things nothing big the stuff hitting coach brian daubach has been telling me has been helping and even teammate mike torres brought something up to me in the cage the other day that helped me out a lot too guys are helping each other out were starting to come together
237322 he wasnt aggressive enough at the plate in the first half of the season
237323 i was telling him swing the bat swing the bat i just wanted him to be more aggressive he was taking too many pitches
237324 were real thin brocktons 31 33 ahead of us and worcester in town tonight is ahead of us they the rox were killing us earlier in the year but now we just took four out of five thats huge
237325 ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months
237326 and this gives us a chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch
237327 i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try to help us reach the postseason
237328 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
237329 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
237330 maybe hes not the player at 38 that he was at 28 but as you saw last night hes still a force on a ballclub and i think hell definitely help the white sox a lot

237364 i believe that these findings could help explain individual susceptibility to sporadic non familial breast cancer since previous work in the medical school has demonstrated an on average higher radiation sensitivity of chromosomes to damage among white blood cells from breast cancer patients when compared with groups of normal non cancer patients
237365 the original aim of the laboratory cell culture work was to test a theory as to the way in which low dose radiation causes damage to our chromosomes our published findings support the theory and suggested a possible way in which this exciting result might help lead us in our ongoing study of patients to understand more about breast cancer susceptibility

237423 science works best when it tests among well framed hypotheses that make different predictions about measurable aspects of the world
237424 once the reasoning associated with scientific thought loses its status as the only adaptive way to think other forms of thought associated with religion cease to be objects of scorn and incomprehension and can be studied as potential adaptations in their own right
237425 shaun hill is resting his shoulder so since it was his turn to work with the first group thats why j t osullivan worked with the first group because if hes going to replace somebodys repetitions in fairness thats what you do and it is still wide open so theyre all competing but thats where its at
237426 no hes been in it all along we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy and now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it fair again j t osullivan still has less reps but he had an opportunity to get some so he got them but this quarterback position is open theyre competing for it as i said all along

237428 this is a completely inadequate deterrent to unscrupulous shop keepers who flout the law to sell these weapons to children and young people
237429 these tiny fines and a lack of custodial punishment is the wrong signal to those who profit from the illegal sale of knives
237430 these figures are particularly worrying as they came to light only days after the release of other figures showing 118 serious crimes in suffolk involved a knife in 2007 8
237431 these figures do not record children and young people separately but they do show that knife crime is a serious problem it is too easy for children and young people to get hold of knives too many are being drawn into a culture of carrying and using knives
237432 from the intelligence recently received by the police and trading standards officers this doesnt seem to be a major problem in suffolk
237433 however we are certainly not going to become complacent during the school holidays when young people have lots of time on their hands our officers will be out and about checking on all aspects of underage sales and responding to complaints
237434 to date we have had little response from the public to our appeals but this is understandable considering the limited information available for release somebody out there holds the key to this investigation ask yourself if anyone you know has been acting unusually or out of character since friday july 18 or saturday july 19 if you do then do not hesitate to come forward and tell us i continue to urge anyone who has any information about this incident to contact suffolk police
237435 a 22 year old has been spoken to by police but he was not arrested and did not attend a police station

237486 the few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor switzerland is designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
237487 at a minimum consumers deserve a complete description of what they are getting when they buy unlimited internet access from an isp

237489 i graduated in 2006 and am currently working as a team secretary in an office because i needed to pay my bills and survive basically theres two points id like to make i started working at this office as a temp paid well i might add i got taken on as an admin assisstant full time and within a couple of months i was being trained to become a team secretary its a shame that the design industry looks to other places to do the groundwork and expect the finished article to turn up on the doorstep the majority anyway the main point here is that yes taking on a graduate is a gamble for companies but that is no excuse not to pay someone while you make your minds up 3 month contracts will do then theres an option at the end the person gets paid in the meantime

237508 previously some scientists believed the diversity we see in south east asia developed only in the past few million years in response to climate and sea level changes caused by the ice ages

237512 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
237513 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
237514 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
237515 this one massive plant will negate the emissions reductions being implemented by the northeastern states in the first mandatory regional program to cut global warming pollution
237516 the administrations shameful decision rewards polluters flouts the clean air act and fails the american people

237523 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
237524 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
237525 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
237526 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
237527 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
237528 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

237538 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
237539 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
237540 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
237541 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
237542 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
237543 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
237544 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
237545 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
237546 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
237547 its a terrible sad story and a hard one to read we cant condone what they did but we can try to understand it good history brings you into the story in a way that you can understand yourself you should wonder what would i have done had i been there

237591 id love for us to call every local member station in the country thats currently airing the program and say we think this needs to stay on the air for the sake of the children
237592 ive been really surprised at the number of program directors and ive talked to 10 so far so a handful of them who just dont have the information about pbs dropping the show from its daily feed i feel like i know more about it and have been educating some of the program directors about this situation
237593 preserve mister rogers neighborhood content and make it available on demand through web streaming so families can access it 24 7
237594 obviously were pleased people want to see mister rogers neighborhood why wouldnt we be
237595 the right thing to do is to talk to your local pbs station if thats what theyre encouraging people to do theyre doing the right thing
237596 its a shame for them to treat it like a museum piece because hes so relevant still as long as children need to be nurtured then there is a place for this program because theres nothing else like it

237604 when we created the foundation our primary goal was to make sure no parent would ever have to experience what we experienced with kendrick especially when heat related illnesses are almost 100 preventable
237605 its so important for parents and coaches to pay extra attention to proper hydration awareness and cool down techniques to help ensure players stay safe on the field during hot summer practices gatorade and the nfl have been instrumental in getting the message out to a much greater audience
237606 heat related illnesses need to be taken seriously at all levels
237607 dangers caused by overexposure to high temperature and humidity are preventable if coaches and players know the early warning signs and stay cool and hydrated simple steps like allowing for acclimatization adjusting the intensity of practice to environmental conditions and access to fluids including properly formulated sports drinks like gatorade can make all the difference
237608 partnering with the national football league and the kendrick fincher memorial foundation is a great way to boost heat illness awareness among football players and coaches at all levels
237609 our goal is to leverage the resources all three organizations bring to the table to educate as many parents coaches and players as possible to help reduce the number of heat related injuries that occur across the country

237653 the state should lead by example and move away from our dependence on coal at the state owned heating plants in madison
237654 global warming demands leadership and as we plan for the future of the madison heating facilities we must chart a course that lowers greenhouse gas emissions and encourages new alternative energy sources
237655 the state should seriously explore the possibility of eliminating coal at the plants considered in this study and move to technologies and fuels that will provide a cleaner energy future for the capital city
237656 we need to use methods of providing energy that do not contribute to air pollution and global warming
237657 this is truly welcome significant news and is another important step to ensuring dane county citizens are able to breathe clean safe air
237658 the employee free choice act is the number one priority of unions to get through congress
237659 they know if the democrats win in november and elect obama were going to pass this new legislation
237660 we knew this was coming but we didnt think itd come this quick
237661 the business community is really scared that it the employee free choice act would help us get more people involved in the unions
237662 their value in the market falls because people worry that by making huge profits and keeping up their productions they are eating up their reserves
237663 oil prices continue to be at a level that will not undermine oil companies second half results but it is likely they will reduce their profits as we see oil prices dropping
237664 obviously this reduces the likelihood of a near term agreement

237691 twelve years ago 98 of political donations went to republicans
237692 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
237693 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
237694 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
237695 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
237696 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
237697 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

237709 it was great stepping back into mulders shoes it would have been depressing if i had to try to play him the same way i did 15 years ago its good we were acknowledging that time had passed and it was interesting to figure out how mulder had changed in the six years since weve seen him to keep him the same but different was somehow tricky because hes a kind of strange hero
237710 but i always thought it was a great tv show and thought if the writing was good enough it would work as a movie
237711 since the series ended i have taken on roles as far away from scully as possible including the last king of scotland and the bbcs bleak house but the movie was something that i liked the idea of and david and i discussed it before the series ended we always said if it was the right time and place for everybody we would all come back and do the movie when it looked like it was finally going to come to fruition it was something that i approached enthusiastically

237724 im not a praying man but if youre up there and you can hear me show me the way
237725 no one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow
237726 if the crisis had a defining moment it came on may 19 at 2 28 p m exactly a week after the quake that was when the entire country paused for three minutes traffic came to a halt flags were lowered to half mast and chinese everywhere stood in oft tearful silence to honor the victims of the wenchuan quake named for the county at its epicenter
237727 because i could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me the carriage held but just ourselves and immortality
237728 do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring forth
237729 it has become a reflex i find it a profound reminder of the murky instability of the future yes i hope to return home at six but god or fate might have other plans this in turn makes me value the present even more
237730 do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light
237731 i shall not die of a cold i shall die of having lived
237732 if you load responsibility on a man unworthy of it he will always betray himself
237733 the bed is a bundle of paradoxes we go to it with reluctance yet we quit it with regret we make up our minds every night to leave it early but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late

237736 citing a campaign of intimidation and violence against his supporters in which dozens were killed and thousands injured
237737 hope is the feeling that the feeling you have isnt permanent

237746 havent you been taught you should be nice to everybody

237749 anyone who does work on the sabbath day shall be put to death
237750 no amount of artificial reinforcement can offset the natural inequalities of human individuals
237751 a heart at peace gives life to the body but envy rots the bones
237752 and i saw that all labor and all achievement spring from mans envy of his neighbor this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind
237753 turns out that clearing the clutter makes you focus on what really counts
237754 one half of the world must sweat and groan that the other half may dream
237755 how the hell does a blimp fit into a kidnapping
237756 love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence
237757 love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species
237758 i dont need you to meet my needs god provides for me i want you to want me not need me
237759 those who marry will face many troubles in this life
237760 love one another and you will be happy its as simple and as difficult as that
237761 when i was engaged the second time i asked my mom how she and dad made it for so many years 53 she said that every single day you have to decide youre committed to the person
237762 you get used to interviewing and then when you go out like i went to college this year then it is so much easier when you have to do an interview for a job or to get into a program for school it is so much easier after just interviewing and they are not judgemental none of the judges are like here to bash you in they are like this is what you did good and it is so encouraging just to come
237763 i am not necessarily looking for technical aspect of what they know and stuff like that i am more interested in what they learned and why they shot it that way and stuf like that so i am more interested in how much fun they have with it
237764 they havent worked out the way wed hoped were going to have to go back to the drawing board
237765 the opportunity is really about asking can i love and cherish whats right in front of me do i choose to work with and appreciate this wonderful flowering gift in the present or do i distract myself with the illusion that there is something better over my shoulder the allure of finding better treasure in the next field
237766 the restless young soul is at odds with the wisdom wanting to be born in and through us and with one another
237767 perfectionist standards do not allow for failure they do not even allow for life

237771 last season was unlike any other in the history of the lsu soccer program and were looking forward to even bigger and better things in 2008
237772 we have the best fans in the country and theyve certainly played a major role in the success we enjoy today i have no doubt that they will enjoy another great season at the lsu soccer complex this fall
237773 by reserving their season tickets they will have the chance to see some outstanding soccer with many of the nations best players in action week in and week out
237774 we appreciate all of our fans for the support theyve given us these last three seasons
237775 lsu soccer is quickly becoming one of the more recognizable programs in womens college soccer were fortunate to have a supportive fanbase that is passionate the sport and our kids feed off of their energy each time they step onto the field its great to be a part of
237776 im going to ask your daughter to be my wife and i hope youre okay with that but if youre not tough shit
237777 if a bison looks like it might attack you try to put something between you and the animal try to get to a place where you can avoid the head
237778 it wont hurt so bad when the bear jams it up your
237779 if they are acting aggressively you know coming toward you you are seeing it in the middle of the daytime its chipping its teeth at you growling or taking an aggressive stance or something like that then youd be ok to go ahead and shoot and kill it
237780 when a cougar is chipping its teeth its actually snapping or chattering or popping its teeth and lips together to show aggression
237781 a voracious herbivore as big as a large housecat and prone to molelike digging that turns lakeshores into swiss cheese
237782 the humboldt squid is a voracious predator that will eat anything it can get its tentacles on
237783 we put a pair of 10 pound squid into a tank and one immediately beheaded the other these are fierce little beasts
237784 the only documented attack on a human was a provoked situation in which a man was bitten while attempting to beat a cornered coyote to death with a 2 by 4
237785 this is like having a personal assistant for your memory
237786 our daily routines are overflowing with situations where we gain new information through meetings advertisements conferences events surfing the web or even window shopping instead of going home and using a general web search to find that information pensieve helps the brain recall those everyday things you might normally forget
237787 this is where the real power of collaboration kicks in
237788 you can recall the name of the person you met right before you entered a meeting by traversing a timeline of your experiences or share a business trip with colleagues by creating a mashup that shows a map with an animation of your trail and the pictures you took in every location
237789 the extra effort to do all this and sync it with your computer later would definitely help ones memory for the information improve
237790 the difficulty is partly in making this extra effort in the first place

237797 ive been waiting much too long for this moment to come along
237798 it really helped in getting the more serious aspects of my case dropped because you know thats what they want to hear youre not an alcoholic and you dont have a problem
237799 its been a long time i thought we were forgotten
237800 they talk about it all the time and there was some sign of relief that the individual is no longer with us
237801 just fatigue some stress lots of stress man headaches just constant everyday it just never ends
237802 phyiscally i look good but mentally you just talk to me right now about anthrax and my whole world is itching me
237803 i had a guy say to me i want your job
237804 traders are more stressed more uncomfortable more fearful about how the years going to turn out and less confident than they have been in years
237805 once they are in a hole psychologically they start panicking
237806 they think maybe i was only successful because i was lucky
237807 what depresses more than loss of money is loss of prestige loss of self esteem embarrassment and comparative failing in contrast with their peers
237808 they just want some medication for anxiety and then never show up again
237809 for me the fair really doesnt start until two things happen
237810 the first i took care of already getting my cheese curds from the janesville optimists second is when i read the names of the fairs king and queen
237811 there were a lot of good people more deserving besides me
237812 4 h has allowed me to meet so many new people and its been exciting to see how ive grown through the great 4 h program we have in rock county
237813 crazy isnt being broken or swallowing a dark secret its you or me amplified
237814 that was just the worst thing i had ever known in my life
237815 i was just by myself so i just thought well ill go down and get the three dogs and theyll watch this thing with me
237816 but i never woke up i never woke up i never woke up
237817 theres three thin layers that covers your brain the blood clot was between the outer and the second layer which was good because it wasnt directly on her brain
237818 i didnt know what to do because they just said there was nothing they could do i felt pretty helpless
237819 but then the doctors came out and said they were going to do surgery and two days later she was standing up i dont know why they changed their mind
237820 its all been really bad because i just wanted to kill myself just be dead i had wished i was a bird and went everywhere else instead of where i was
237821 she knew what she wanted and what she had to do but she couldnt express it
237822 everything ive read about people whove had these they say the same thing theyre sitting looking at a person and nothing comes its like in your mind your talking but its just coming out mumbo jumbo so it really creates some anxiety for them
237823 she cried probably 70 percent of the time and a read to her a lot of the time
237824 he was with me like a doctor he was so wonderful for me i dont think so many men would have helped their woman like he did for me
237825 this thing pointing to her skull they had to take the thing off
237826 they went inside and i thought oh my god theyre going to give it to somebody else it was really terrible i didnt look at myself because i knew i was so ugly i had no hair i thought if they would just give me back my thing i would be able to think well that wasnt true
237827 a lot of it was creating a lot of anxiety because there was nothing there
237828 she had to wear a helmet and it was just really unnerving to have no skull there
237829 it helped when she got back here being around her stuff
237830 when we got home she started getting better more and more faster than down there in the hospital she would start doing things and shed start remembering this and that just from seeing stuff she was familiar with
237831 shed go into her office and get frustrated and start crying
237832 she knew there was something in there she used to do but she didnt know what
237833 and then when i read them several times it was like three or four weeks later when she starting reading and writing it kind of just started all of a sudden she had me reading her scripts to her and i read them several times and she started connecting with remembering what shed written for a long time she couldnt believe she wrote them
237834 i can listen to the ones that ive already written
237835 if i think its just a little bit ehhh then ill change it a little bit but only just two words
237836 shes really maticulous she always was shes probably worse now
237837 shes told me stories pretty well she just cant put them in words its like a checking account she can go through and balance a checking account pay bills so she can do those kinds of things its just connecting the words with paper is difficult for
237838 it must have been the lord as i was asleep
237839 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things yet unseen
237840 theyre living in a world of literature a world where theyre thinking about epiphanies and character changes all the time so it seems natural that theyd apply that to themselves
237841 i think that creative writing teachers have a reputation at least within english departments of being anti intellectuals
237842 and they also have a reputation of sleeping with their students like in the squid and the whale

237871 we cast anchor near tybee island where groves of pines running along the shore made an agreeable prospect showing as it were the bloom of spring in the depth of winter

237941 having been friends first they totally got to know each other first without romance getting in the way and spike has been very supportive during this most difficult time for michelle since splitting from heath last year and his death in january
237942 matilda means the world to michelle who is now left alone to raise her daughter and spike who has no children of his own has been very good to both michelle and matilda
237943 spike had a gentle way of just being there for michelle there was no pressure for her to spend time with him he just wanted to be a loving supportive shoulder for michelle to cry on

237946 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
237947 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
237948 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
237949 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
237950 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
237951 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

237958 at this point in time i can say that growth will be positive and significantly so
237959 its very important to remember that what we have is a one off inflation brought on by costs going up and not a demand pull which means that for next year for example the numbers will not be repeated
237960 based on fundamentals and this is inclusive of the demand from india and china with their growing middle class population the price of oil should be between us 100 and us 120 per barrel

238025 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
238026 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
238027 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
238028 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
238029 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
238030 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
238031 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like

238044 forecasts made at the start of the year are in the shredder said associate dean lee mcpheters of arizona state university
238045 since the collapse of subprime lending arizonas bloodied housing market has been leaning heavily on a makeshift crutch known as seller funded down payment assistance a federal housing bill signed into law wednesday will yank away that crutch on oct 1
238046 customers in outlying communities such as laveen maricopa surprise and the hunt highway corridor of northern pinal county currently use down payment assistance for nine out of every 10 sales said phoenix real estate analyst jim belfiore
238047 almost every builder out there is heavily marketing homes with down payment assistance he said
238048 surprise resident jesse grob said its a shame first time buyers will no longer be able to utilize seller funded assistance programs as he did
238049 the market for homes in the verde valley both new and old continues to slip not only are sales of existing homes down from a year ago but the average price has also continued to drop the slump is valley wide
238050 the median price has fallen by 34 700 in the cottonwood clarkdale and cornville area to 200 800 and by 19 000 in camp verde to 217 000 one of the major factors driving the price of resale homes downward is bank repossession

238052 audra stadelman sales manager for coldwell banker in cottonwood agrees
238053 according to witt the market has an almost three year supply of homes if houses continue to sell at the current rate

238055 home sales are down across the state and nowhere is falling further than tooele county according to a new report by the salt lake board of realtors home sales in tooele county fell 36 percent in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007 a larger drop than in salt lake davis weber and utah counties for the same period median sales prices in tooele county declined 6 percent to 183 300 again the largest drop of the five counties
238056 kelly matthews chief economist for wells fargo amp company in salt lake city said tooele countys decrease in home sales may be partly caused by rising gas prices
238057 in a place like tooele gas prices are going to pose a problem in relation to someone buying a home unless they plan to work in tooele he said
238058 matthews also attributes the drop in home sales to tighter lending restrictions which make it harder for potential buyers to qualify for a home loan
238059 the solution to this would be home prices readjusting in relation to peoples incomes and thats a process were working through he said
238060 a glut of unsold new homes along the wasatch front is starting to shrink as more homebuyers come out of the woodwork according to a report released thursday by newreach ut the number of new homes abandoned halfway through construction particularly those priced above 350 000 is also rising said todd cook newreachs executive vp of research
238061 as our research shows builders are working their way through speculation inventory which is good news however there are more new homes abandoned than we have seen before cook said
238062 in the second quarter there were about 150 abandoned new homes in the north utah county area mostly in the cities of saratoga springs and eagle mountain
238063 that number is rising the reason is likely that with many of these homes that were started the builder is not able to finish because of construction loan release requirements said jason eldredge newreachs executive vp of sales
238064 lehi continues to lead the state for the third consecutive quarter with the greatest number of unsold homes accounting for a whopping 233 units followed by saratoga springs with 194 units and eagle mountain with 157 units according to the newreach report
238065 the number of unsold new homes and condominiums in utah county fell to 951 unsold units in the second quarter from a year ago and is down slightly from 987 units at the end of 2007
238066 numbers from local agencies designed to attract new businesses to the las vegas valley reported dips in the number of companies moving to the area and recorded drops in the economic impact of corporate growth here
238067 when i look at the numbers im not thrilled with them said somer hollingsworth ceo of the nevada development authority
238068 lenders with second home loans would be wiped out and probably wont agree to the fha loan arrangements if they dont also hold the first mortgage on a home she said
238069 how many second mortgage lenders are going to be willing to eat the balance on their loan
238070 wells fargo bank one of the biggest home lenders in nevada is analyzing geographic areas and may approve the fha refinancing and loan reductions in distressed areas possibly including parts of clark county said kirk clausen regional president of wells fargo bank
238071 it could include some forgiveness on some mortgage loans that might be underwater clausen said
238072 glickman has buyers to turn these troubled homes around but the banks and mortgage lenders grind things to a halt and put the whole sale in jeopardy she says they dont have the knowledge or man power to handle the crisis
238073 literally out of his mouth you know finally after asking enough questions really yeah ya we pretty much dont know what were doing said glickman
238074 its the same problem for signature one mortgage rep jeff kauffman he secures the money for the buyer and is shocked at how banks could be so ill prepared for the deal then were waiting and were waiting and theyll say itll be over by friday friday comes around and its not there said kauffman
238075 this is all happening when home prices are down nearly 30 percent compared to a year ago thats the worst drop in the country sometimes common sense doesnt apply to them said kauffman
238076 glickman says they wont accept the reality that the home price bubble has burst theyre shooting themselves in the foot because they dont understand the decline in the market and whats happening she said
238077 the i team spoke over the phone with a few banks today they didnt really have an answer for why these foreclosure sales take longer and are more complicated
238078 wells fargo did say they are having to take over more properties as foreclosures continue to rise theyre not dragging their feet on purpose wells fargo said it wants to sell these homes as soon as it can but there are so many foreclosures they literally cannot keep up
238079 the valley is full of for sale signs for those who are selling the news is not good the case schiller housing index shows home prices fell by the steepest rate ever in may and las vegas is down 28 4 percent that could very well be true said patty kelly president of the greater las vegas association of realtors
238080 she said two out of three homes are being sold after foreclosure bringing down median sales prices kelly said that makes it a great market for buyers
238081 its a buyers market for sure i moved here from jersey im going to rent first but seriously look hard in this area said resident bert potts
238082 chris adams was excited to be one of the first occupants of a midrise condominium complex along centennial parkway in north las vegas it made the perfect bachelor pad with its modern architecture apple red exterior and view of the mountains
238083 eighteen months later hes getting pretty tired of still being one of the first occupants of the place in the three building complex totaling 75 units adams has only seven neighbors
238084 the other units sit vacant in varying degrees of completion its spooky at night the darkness of the desert enclosing on the nearly empty buildings theres little noise or movement
238085 the pool is empty and the clubhouse remains locked keeping a fitness center and a community room off limits in front of the complex the address appears to have been hastily spray painted on a slab of rock above it a billboard depicts a good looking couple embracing enjoying carefree living
238086 i can tell you that they dont live here adams says because he really does know everyone in the neighborhood
238087 in january 2007 he plunked down 20 000 cash for his 218 000 condo then he noticed the plumbers werent coming to finish work on neighboring units in his building soon the electricians stopped returning when all the workers were gone he started to worry
238088 the complex went into foreclosure now another developer plans to purchase the project but they might not be blue marble development wants to convert the unsold units into apartments

238211 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
238212 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
238213 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
238214 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
238215 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
238216 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
238217 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
238218 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
238219 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
238220 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
238221 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
238222 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
238223 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
238224 this charter lets the nearly 1 2 million american veterans of the korean war who have survived know that we have not forgotten them and we honor the sacrifice they made for our nation
238225 the charter will allow us to train service officers to get to d c where theyre considering veteran benefits and train them to be lobbyists
238226 well have service officers at all va locations when they have bills coming over from congress we can now have our say on them
238227 we had some kwva presidents elected that were weak and that werent really concerned about it
238228 also the kwva wasnt established until 1985 whereas other va organizations go back a long way
238229 we just re organized the whole thing we now have a database and an office in washington
238230 there was a republican bill and a democratic bill and whatever party had the majority of voting shares would sit on it

238234 the fact that the va is unable to identify how billions of dollars are being spent underscores the urgent need to review and refine a process that is clearly broken

238240 since i teach clinical medicine there is no better way to learn it than by having patients in the classroom
238241 we use many actors to demonstrate clinical scenarios having actors show depression anxiety psychosis dementia is much more fun that just talking about them or reading them from books
238242 it is more than a video dvd because it asks the student questions its like a slightly high tech version of shortland street a daily drama show with a hospital setting
238243 i started monitoring patients on experimental treatment from midnight to 7 a m and administering experimental drugs looking at the effects on their mood well being and sleep

238260 south canterbury finance ltd was incorporated in 1926 and apart from two years in the early 1930s has traded profitably over these 82 years a feat that no other finance company in new zealand has achieved
238261 the company survived the great depression a world war 1939 45 the 70s oil shock and numerous cycles in the property sector
238262 south canterbury finance ltds business is mainly concentrated on provincial lending only 15 of our loans are centred in auckland and wellington and this makes south canterbury finance ltd unique not being dependent on the economies of these two cities
238263 we are still receiving strong loan inquiries in many areas but are only accepting the best applications
238264 we have always taken time to understand the borrower and his proposition before considering his present financial position i believe in backing young people with good ideas
238265 the success of all businesses i have been involved with hinges on cash flow i have always been focused on the liquidity of the company and we have always retained more cash than some experts consider necessary
238266 at 30th june 2008 we had 334 million in the bank along with a further 150 million of undrawn bank facilities this money protects your investment
238267 as well 84 of our borrowers repay their loans by principal and interest in monthly instalments ensuring a constant cash flow

238283 i commend pg amp e for their vision of implementing renewable energy on a true san francisco landmark

238657 our members are dedicated to effective political action and education in order to change america as we approach the third millennium the need for an active educated movement of catholic voters has never been more urgent we deeply appreciate the support of bishops mchugh and egan in their leadership of this advisory council as well as their demonstrated courage in their own pastoral leadership

238675 it is a very important issue to me that there will be no private healthcare state hospitals dont have the facilities that other hospitals do and many people die especially quadriplegics

238840 it appears that there is a widespread problem of poor or no grounds maintenance when the greenbelt group are responsible
238841 this seems to be the case both when residents are paying on an annual basis and when the developer has paid a lump sum on completion of the development
238842 i have been a councillor for nine years and i have been aware of recurring problems involving the greenbelt group
238843 i would ask you to look into the problems surrounding the operations of this company i would also ask you to examine whether we can revert to the situation prior to 1992 where it was almost invariably the case that public open space passed to the local council
238844 in my experience the local council provides the only reliable and sustainable maintenance solution for public open space
238845 greenbelt has had problems in the north east and are trying to resolve them as quickly as possible we will take a look at the particular problems and value for money
238846 we are committed to the sites in the north east and are committed to giving a good service

238859 as tim berners lee did in beijing kelly draws parallels between the size of the web and the size of the human brain
238860 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
238861 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
238862 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
238863 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
238864 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
238865 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
238866 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

238891 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
238892 these terrorist groups are not as capable as some media organizations have claimed or broadcast
238893 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
238894 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed

238904 we referring to herself and deputy garcia look up in the corner of the room theres a bed and obviously you know theres a child whos obviously not you know not breathing
238905 the next thing i see is a tall white male very skinny hes naked hes not wearing any clothes the best way to describe it would be like a when you see people come across the finish line in a track race just with everything he has flying flying across the room headed towards um it would be the the end of the room here and then i still i still had my gun and alex was shooting
238906 he was bleeding from his abdomen with with he had a leatherman in his hand but i dont know if i saw that before or after it happened so fast

238913 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
238914 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
238915 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party

238920 bring a lawn chair theres plenty of room in the park
238921 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
238922 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
238923 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation

238928 is it any wonder that the doctrine of eternal damnation is de emphasized in preaching today
238929 not a living being but is a symbol of evil
238930 while he lived on earth jesus committed sins like other people
238931 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
238932 and this is the judgment the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil
238933 the lord looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand who seek after god they have all turned aside together they have become corrupt there is none who does good not even one
238934 this person is crying for help but doesnt know it
238935 truly truly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
238936 if the professed convert distinctly and deliberately declares that he knows the lords will but does not mean to attend to it you are not to pamper his presumption but it is your duty to assure him that he is not saved do you imagine that the gospel is magnified or god glorified by going to the worldlings and telling them that they may be saved at this moment by simply accepting christ as their saviour while they are wedded to their idols and their hearts are still in love with sin if i do so i tell them a lie pervert the gospel insult christ and turn the grace of god into lasciviousness

238942 the great strength of these lectures turned book is the sweep of their coverage instead of becoming just one more voice in the rising debate between christians and the new atheists dr mohler has chosen to provide us with masterful coverage of the dominant writers on both sides having recently worked through most of this material myself i happily attest how accurate and penetrating are mohlers surveys and assessments i know of no other introduction to this crucial debate that is as comprehensive and clear in such brief compass mohler tells us whats going on shows us how much depends on the outcome of this titanic cultural shift and provides guidance to the resources christians need to challenge the new atheism root and branch
238943 has certainly once again dented investor appetite for venezuelan debt
238944 investors remain quite concerned that these nationalizations are a big cash drain on government liquidity
238945 finally and probably the most important reason why investors are worried are private property rights
238946 it considered the sale of banco de venezuela to a venezuelan private investor group with whom certain undertakings were entered into but the sale was not however agreed
238947 thereafter become aware of the interest of the government of venezuela in banco de venezuela and is now in discussions in that connection
238948 several recent political developments in venezuela present an increased risk that the venezuelan government could nationalize or otherwise seek to intervene in the operations of our venezuelan subsidiary which could negatively affect our operations in venezuela
238949 the move really wont impact its santanders bottom line much
238950 no wonder fdi foreign direct investment has basically dried up in recent years
238951 the government is looking to strengthen state owned banks as a way to stimulate slowing credit growth offer more heavily subsidized services to consumers and facilitate payments to social programs and infrastructure projects in the run up to novembers local and regional elections

238957 shes a severe diabetic her eyesight is failing and she barely gets around with a cane shes also becoming increasingly forgetful

238964 just one example unions used to provide an effective check on out of control executive pay unions would rightly demand a cut of the pie when executives tried to give themselves out of proportion pay raises it was exceedingly difficult for executives to argue that they deserved multi million dollar raises but that there was no money to offer a modest raise for the average company worker
238965 to simplify matters economies are stronger and societies healthier when the middle class is thriving unions can help to create a larger more robust middle class
238966 i dont understand why this is anything new and warranting of a post
238967 as an example i worked part time for the university during college and every paycheck i took a hit on money that i couldve used to spend on beer for gods sakes

238992 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
238993 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
238994 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
238995 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee

239009 o ney franco chegou e conseguiu nos passar muita confian a e uma tranquilidade para que cada um conseguisse mostrar o seu melhor futebol al m disso ele conhece muito bem o nosso time pois comandou o flamengo por muito tempo e nos enfrentou por diversas vezes
239010 meu momento agora de pensar apenas no botafogo e em conseguir fazer a equipe continuar a se aproximar do grupo dos quatro primeiros do brasileiro
239011 at que conseguimos jogar bem contra o santos e contra o s o paulo mas o resultado acabou sendo decepcionante para a gente mas acho que n o tem segredo para se vencer fora se existe n s ainda n o sabemos
239012 eu e o renato renato silva estamos nos entendendo muito bem e cada um procura passar confian a ao outro claro que levar gols sempre o nosso objetivo ali atr s mas o mais importante que o botafogo consiga vencer

239040 o morais um jogador que patrim nio do clube o que n s conversamos a melhor maneira de encarar uma atitude que n o foi acertada foi uma atitude muito emocional atingido pelas ofensas e pelas amea as ele tomou uma atitude que ao inv s de melhorar a situa o tenderia a pior la
239041 o clube se interessa pelo morais como sempre se interessou ele tem sua vida ligada ao vasco e o que fizemos foi conversarmos um pouco ele mesmo est convencido de que n o foi a atitude mais sensata s trouxe preju zos para ele e para o vasco estamos em um momento em que precisamos de uni o para fazer um vasco mais forte

239045 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
239046 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us

239076 tonight the vietnamese team had a good match the weather tonight was nice and i liked this match very much
239077 im happy with the match although we had little training we would like to thank vietnamese fans and the hosts for giving us a warm welcome and good preparation
239078 having the brazilian players in vietnam is a once in a lifetime event
239079 its a great opportunity to see ronaldinho pato and anderson
239080 its unbelievable to see them playing football in vietnam the vietnamese are like the brazilians in their love for soccer
239081 im very surprised about the warm welcome and the enthusiasm from the vietnamese fans for soccer i will have a lot of things to tell my friends back home
239082 there are many young players who have a lot of experience and i think that will make the difference for us
239083 we have let many chances of gold slip many good teams have played the olympics and we have never managed to win it now we have the opportunity we have a very good team
239084 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
239085 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
239086 the iranians sent mixed messages this week and its very hard to tell what the bottom line is
239087 we hope to have a clear answer either today or tomorrow but if it comes monday what difference does it make
239088 we are not making any official comment or statement at this time
239089 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
239090 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
239091 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
239092 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death we ask that the media respect the privacy of his family and allow them to grieve
239093 the track was very dusty this morning once again the car felt good even though i encountered quite a lot of traffic during both sessions
239094 this afternoon i also got to try the revised aero package for the first time it definitely seemed to make the car better balanced which is very encouraging
239095 i am enjoying myself so far and so i am looking forward to the race with a lot of confidence but i know that we have a lot of work to do yet
239096 were just thinking about playing russia right now and about keeping getting better
239097 i think if you look ahead you can get knocked off by anybody i think we played really well tonight because we had so much respect for lithuania who i think will also be a medal round team or a medal winner
239098 im healthy as ive been in two years im excited not only about this opportunity but also about the rest of my career
239099 we lost the game and we lost very badly but dont forget against whom we played
239100 we played against the best team in the world against the best players and the best coach the american players were stronger and faster we lost the game one on one and we lost the plays under the basket
239101 im looking forward to challenging malignaggi for his title las vegas is a second home for me
239102 the fans treat me like gold i promise them another value for money fight
239103 we are in a good position to control the match tomorrow
239104 we have to repeat our performance take catches and bowl in the right areas as we did today if we take a couple of early wickets the tail will start
239105 we are happy with our efforts today but it would have been nice to get more runs in the first innings
239106 he mendis is a very good bowler and has got lot of variations bowlers like him are good for the game
239107 we know that fios will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force

239113 he bills himself as a conservative although thinking conservatives after an initial chuckle or two should want to put as much distance between him and themselves as possible
239114 his favorite technique for discrediting an idea with which he disagrees is to make petty personal attacks against the people who espouse that idea
239115 he is not a nice man and he doesnt pretend to be and hes nasty

239130 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
239131 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
239132 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
239133 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
239134 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
239135 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
239136 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
239137 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
239138 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
239139 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money

239150 the dragon boat festival this year was the most successful to date not only for all the companies which took part but a fantastic day for the staff here at e4b
239151 we were delighted to be chosen once again as e4bs charity of the year and to be the main beneficiary again of the milton keynes dragon boat festival this event is not only significant to us in terms of the money it raises but also because of the awareness it raises within the local community about our work caring for life limited children and their families were extremely grateful to everyone at e4b for their continued support and thank the staff for all their efforts on our behalf
239152 through my interactions with kdmc and its ceo alvin hoover i became aware of the hospitals desire to implement an electronic medical records system the hospitals leadership is always looking for ways to improve their operations and in turn patient care
239153 qhrs relationship with strategic health care really proved helpful in securing this grant money together we were able to navigate the grants application process and assist kings daughters in moving forward with their plan to bring an electronic medical records system to brookhaven it was a tremendous team effort
239154 electronic medical records will improve the quality of care provided to our patients by making patient information readily accessible to physicians and other healthcare providers the new system will also provide increased patient privacy
239155 our organization is thankful to qhr strategic health care and sen wicker for their help in securing this grant specifically id like to thank qhr for identifying this opportunity and then helping kdmc seize it
239156 these funds will serve as the cornerstone of medical technology at kings daughters medical center
239157 i look forward to working with sen cochran to ensure this important funding is advanced as this bill moves through the remainder of the legislative process
239158 this enhanced version represents an important improvement over the previous versions we have noticed that easyblank users must handle all kinds of cad file formats from many different tool and die shops and stamping companies in order to meet their needs and to add more value we have provided a new add on module it increases the attractiveness of easyblank and significantly extends its capability
239159 this could result in some short term adverse impacts to local economies and resource extraction businesses

239192 as with most tax incentives the processes from application to filing claims are complicated to help simplify the process plante amp moran can provide movie producers with a complete cradle to grave solution from applying for the credit or rebate to claiming the credit on a return

239194 i started my working life as a detailer straight after school and then moved into the tyre industry initially i have to admit it was just a job but then i found i really enjoyed it i like the contact with people and the fact youre always busy
239195 i like this company i like the fact that its all australian and i think the customers like it too i think they like the fact theyre dealing with a local company run by locals familiar faces rather than a big multi national run by someone they dont know
239196 its probably a country thing it does take a long time to be accepted as a local if you havent been in the area for a while people like dealing with people they know and obviously people around here have known john and me for a long time
239197 lots of people forget that service is what builds your business we have good products premium products and they sell themselves so the big difference is the service people get when they walk in here

239219 how come americans hate people who rape and gouge the american people for a profit these days whats the point of starting a business if you cannot make money and have that same profit subsidized by taxes and public land at the same time

239481 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
239482 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly

239486 led technology has come a long way from semiconductor components to sustainable lighting solutions we continue to focus our attention into the research and development of led light source to create new products with long life energy savings and substantial light output

239488 for me the biggest priority for our sound system is intelligibility
239489 its not just about the volume or output of the music people come here to be moved by the word of god we need the best audio solution which allows our audience to enjoy every facet of our services
239490 given the size and layout of the main theater we knew that four clusters would be the best design to reach all points in the auditorium evenly

239497 if he in fact was the correct person he was actually put in charge of analyzing the evidence of his own crime
239498 all of the scientists there who worked with us were supposed to have been investigated and given polygraph tests
239499 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
239500 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
239501 they took an innocent man a distinguished scientist and smeared his reputation dishonored him questioned his children and drove him to take his life
239502 he just didnt have the swagger the ego to pull off that kind of thing and he didnt have the lab skills to make the fine powder anthrax that was used in the letters
239503 could this be another single minded focus is this another we think we got him but we dont have him
239504 based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack
239505 the isi is a very disciplined organization manned by military officials it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda the taliban and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9 11
239506 despite our insistence no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations
239507 weve long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports
239508 there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story
239509 there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
239510 over 50 of the time visual inspections were found to be incorrect

239516 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
239517 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
239518 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation

239528 understand their challenges their plans for the future and how we can help them obviously its much more effectively done in person
239529 we want to have a good understanding of the market so hiring local talent provides that
239530 youve got to have a workforce that you can control and you can invest in and grow talent and skills over time and that usually doesnt happen offshore
239531 the key thing is that companies of all kinds are operating globally and that means they need to have talent located in countries all around the world
239532 when you look at global energy prices to be able to produce close to your consumers is a key competitive advantage
239533 its widely recognized among business experts that when companies join together in some fashion whether its an out and out takeover or a genuine merger theyre after greater efficiencies
239534 they want to consolidate and usually that means they fire workers
239535 if we look at the same subject in five years we may indeed see that its grown to meaningful proportions we also may see that it was a flash in the pan to the extent that it ever existed we simply dont have enough information
239536 people dont want to follow that career path because their sense is there wont be jobs for them
239537 and weve been looking for qualified workers and weve been finding them and filling the jobs
239538 as a company at amp t is committed to programs such as aspire that help prepare more u s workers for jobs like the ones were bringing back

239570 the introductions of the t4 have gone remarkably well and they are now fully integrated with the resident group at least we can all have a smile at the gorillas looking very relaxed sitting high up eyeing their new ever green environment
239571 i am afraid that i do not have good news yesterday morning oyin one of the t4 gorillas died she had been suffering from an illness since late may and we have been fighting to diagnose what the problem was and to treat her since she began showing symptoms
239572 at the lwc we are all completely devastated and exhausted we have been battling with oyin for the past 10 days and we are all wiped out
239573 there are four crucial dates in any animal rehabilitation programme of this kind their first walk in the wild the first night they spent outside the enclosure the first time they are left alone during the day and finally the day the walker stops accompanying them
239574 the bears had begun showing reluctance to return to the camp at night after a few months from their first walk since april 2008 all but one spent their nights outside their enclosure in the camp choosing to rest on the trees as they do in the wild during their walks they foraged on leaves shoots of bamboo wild fruits barks of various tree species and termites

239590 none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
239591 gods providence is his constant care for and his absolute rule over all his creation for his own glory and the good of his people
239592 if we are to trust god we must learn to see that he is continuously at work in every aspect and every moment of our lives
239593 this then is divine providence god sustaining and governing his universe bringing all events to their appointed end
239594 while it is certainly true that gods love for us does not protect us from pain and sorrow it is also true that all occasions of pain and sorrow are under the absolute control of god if god controls the circustances of the sparrow how much more does he control the circumstances that affect us god does not walk away and leave us to the mercy of uncontrolled random or chance events

239638 though it has been nearly 50 years since he stepped down as secretary of state the dulles papers continue to be among the most heavily used here at the mudd manuscript library
239639 this reflects the importance of his tenure as well as the time during which he served scholars travel from around the country as well as japan and europe to study his letters memoranda and speeches
239640 winston churchill reportedly said there were three kinds of u
239641 however now that i have had the opportunity to explore dulles life i cannot imagine how that could be true he was deeply involved in major world events for over 50 years and approached every task with such zeal i hope this exhibition reflects my and his enthusiasm
239642 i made a fool of myself over john foster dulles
239643 dulles was the fifth princetonian to serve as secretary of state and the length of his tenure was second only to james madisons

239676 o que do meu conhecimento que eles foram vetados pelos m dicos o leandro voltou a sentir a mesma les o que j tinha sentido e o jean est tratando de um problema no tornozelo
239677 acho que ontem quinta ele se equivocou um pouco ao falar no meu nome sempre dei moral para ele n o sei o motivo dele falar o meu nome pois sou um cara que me dedica bastante do jogo e nos treinos at jogar na lateral esquerda eu j joguei
239678 me machuquei contra o flamengo e vim for ando o meu tornozelo atuei no sacrif cio nos ltimos tr s jogos conversei com o lopes para dar uma parada pois n o vinha jogando bem parei para tratar e estou melhorando como eu ia para o jogo se n o havia treinado nenhuma vez e nem estava concentrado
239679 sou funcion rio do clube e sempre fiz a minha parte vou procurar conversar com ele mas se ele n o quiser n o tem problema vou continuar trabalhando normalmente
239680 o edmundo n o m dico para falar de mim
239681 vou fazer mais um treinamento amanh s bado e aproveitei este treinamento para testar alguma coisa fiz as minhas observa es
239682 ele tem uma personalidade formada e tem muita qualidade na marca o e com a bola nos p s
239683 o ney franco chegou e conseguiu nos passar muita confian a e uma tranquilidade para que cada um conseguisse mostrar o seu melhor futebol al m disso ele conhece muito bem o nosso time pois comandou o flamengo por muito tempo e nos enfrentou por diversas vezes
239684 meu momento agora de pensar apenas no botafogo e em conseguir fazer a equipe continuar a se aproximar do grupo dos quatro primeiros do brasileiro
239685 at que conseguimos jogar bem contra o santos e contra o s o paulo mas o resultado acabou sendo decepcionante para a gente mas acho que n o tem segredo para se vencer fora se existe n s ainda n o sabemos
239686 eu e o renato renato silva estamos nos entendendo muito bem e cada um procura passar confian a ao outro claro que levar gols sempre o nosso objetivo ali atr s mas o mais importante que o botafogo consiga vencer
239687 essa passagem por um clube grande como o corinthians e tamb m pela europa vai me ajudar muito aqui no fluminense
239688 sei que tem grandes jogadores e venho para buscar o meu espa o e mostrar o meu futebol
239689 essa partida est sendo encarada com muita expectativa por se tratar de um evento tradicional e pela rivalidade entre japoneses e sul coreanos
239690 os japoneses v o lotar o est dio e com certeza ser uma festa muito bonita
239691 tive a oportunidade de reunir os jogadores e fazer apenas um treinamento enquanto a cor ia do sul suspendeu os jogos do campeonato local e est o treinando h uma semana eles t m uma equipe forte com base da sele o nacional e refor ados por dois brasileiros e um croata
239692 o morais um jogador que patrim nio do clube o que n s conversamos a melhor maneira de encarar uma atitude que n o foi acertada foi uma atitude muito emocional atingido pelas ofensas e pelas amea as ele tomou uma atitude que ao inv s de melhorar a situa o tenderia a pior la
239693 o clube se interessa pelo morais como sempre se interessou ele tem sua vida ligada ao vasco e o que fizemos foi conversarmos um pouco ele mesmo est convencido de que n o foi a atitude mais sensata s trouxe preju zos para ele e para o vasco estamos em um momento em que precisamos de uni o para fazer um vasco mais forte
239694 quanto seguran a o que aconteceu foi um fato isolado mas j tomamos medidas para evitar que a rea de circula o dos jogadores seja melhor cuidada pela seguran a o morais poder ficar totalmente tranquilo quanto a isso
239695 o morais valorizado por n s mas se tiver oferta vamos considerar em termos do que o vasco necessita para recompor financeiro e tamb m do jogador depender do tipo de proposta e da posi o de parte a parte
239696 o edmundo n o m dico para falar de mim
239697 na entrada do campo alguns chefes de torcida vieram falar comigo e perguntaram se eu podia atend los por dez quinze minutos eles colocaram suas id ias e fiquei feliz e at passei isso para os meus jogadores que eles est o totalmente juntos com o nosso grupo est o prontos para apoiar o nosso time amanh uma prova de que eles est o entendendo o momento que estamos passando
239698 o grupo est nas m os e n o tem nenhum probleminha
239699 o momento do wellington ele vinha treinando muito forte e est apto a retornar al m disso ele tem uma hist ria muito importante dentro do clube e merece total respeito

239879 wir m ssen auch endlich verstehen dass gewisse regionen die geografisch benachteiligt sind h here wirtschaftsf rderungen bekommen m ssen analog zu den ziel 1 gebieten der eu sollte man auch national definieren welche regionen besondere f rderungen und unterst tzungen brauchen

239884 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

239890 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
239891 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
239892 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
239893 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
239894 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
239895 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
239896 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
239897 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
239898 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
239899 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
239900 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

239902 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
239903 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
239904 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
239905 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
239906 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
239907 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
239908 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
239909 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
239910 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
239911 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
239912 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
239913 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
239914 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
239915 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
239916 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
239917 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

239955 i knew her when her patterns were just in the sidebar
239956 wow the color attracted me i didnt know you werekwame or this is your brand i was actually attracted by the quality and the color and the fabrics of the ties
239957 when you have 30 creatures on screen and four or five different types target prioritization is a factor you need to be able to tell those things apart fast and you cant do that when your world is gray and your creatures are gray
239958 i feel the developers owe it to the fans to flat out tell us their intentions
239959 im a big sc junkie and ive yet to complain about the new look but i do lurk to sc2 boards on gamefaqs and its full of idiots that complain about every little changed detail
239960 i think the more ability oriented micro of scii which its starting to look like is also just another way to cover up poor gamedesign
239961 im still trying to get over the fact that people were are
239962 las similitudes con el auto original se reducen a la carrocer a y a la disposici n central trasera de la mec nica por todo lo dem s se trata de un deportivo totalmente diferente
239963 el gt40 es un concepto que ya tiene m s de cuatro d cadas por lo que hubo que repensar el sistema de frenos la direcci n y la suspensi n
239964 claro que me gustar a vender un gt40 aqu pero es un auto demasiado llamativo para nuestras calles
239965 age of conan released with some initial success we did see some of our players leave but about 40 percent of those players have returned to world of warcraft
239966 a product that has been continually enhanced expanded and refined for almost four years now
239967 thank you for letting us play while you walk to your cars
239968 i thought we were gonna get in game recovery menu can you implement that in 4 01 m33 3 then release this dc
239969 youd have probably noticed some features of this new cfw that were told on french forums but to tell the truth neither the savestates or the recovery on xmb or etc would at 100 probability be implemented at once maybe later on m33 2
239970 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
239971 played the race card from the bottom of the deck
239972 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others
239973 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
239974 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
239975 todays wall street journal story demonstrates once again that wal mart intimidates its workers
239976 i m shocked next thing you re going to tell me is brett favre is coming back
239977 if you can t hit left handers you bunt if you can t hit righ thanders you bunt if you can t make the all star team you go to the bahamas
239978 i did it to restore the intensity of the game before we did this i had guys like ron santo and hank aaron coming up to me and saying the all star game meant so much to us they wanted me to do something

239989 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
239990 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
239991 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
239992 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package

239994 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
