6960097 similarly monetary relief was appropriate in this case because remediation could take more than thirty years and such relief provides finality as well as a greater likelihood that appellees will be able to actually collect on their judgment in contribution cases the court has the power to fashion remedies based on equitable considerations cercla section 113 f 1 in resolving contribution claims the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding monetary relief in this case
6960098 simon also takes issue with the uncertainty premium applied by the district court as simon concedes the ultimate total cost of cleanup will continue to be a moving target it therefore asserts that the application of an uncertainty premium of fifty percent to past and future costs is in error where past costs are known and future costs are speculative in nature however it is precisely because of this uncertainty that the district court awarded the premium in this case the district court reasoned that the use of an uncertainty premium is often an effective mechanism to to ensure that the parties assuming cleanup are not unduly burdened by unforeseen future costs and to acknowledge the benefit settling parties receive in resolving their liability early because it found that there was evidence that the ultimate total cost of cleanup could be higher than originally anticipated and that the cleanup could take thirty years the district court found that an uncertainty premium on total costs was an equitable method of acknowledging the benefit received by simon in resolving its liability prior to the completion of the cleanup because the district court is permitted to allocate costs in such an equitable manner cercla section 113 f 1 it has not abused its discretion in imposing an uncertainty premium here

6960195 when a community is led by their villains and if their leader happens to be wretched and if a debauching is honoured then let them wait expect a calamity to behalf them
6960196 we are the household of the prophethood the source of messengership the descending place of the angels through us allah has begun showering his favours and with us he has perfected his blessings yazeed is a sinful man a drunkard killer of innocent people and one who openly indulges in sinful acts a person like me can never pay allegiance to a person like him
6960197 i cant ride roller costers because they make me sick
6960198 everybodys going home at 3 30 because im going home at 3 30
6960199 verily i am leaving with you the two most valuable and weighty objects the book of god and my household the thaqalain indeed these two shall not part with each other until they join up with me by the pond
6960200 by god this man muhammad could not be one from worldly rulers
6960201 undoubtedly this gentleman ought to be a messenger of allah as claimed by himself
6960202 the prophet of islam had taught that at the time of separation from a companion in a journey one should follow him by few steps as a mark of respect and bidding farewell to him i wished to comply with this teaching hence my following you
6960203 verily those who had become the followers of the prophet was due to his supreme humanely conduct and let me hold you oali as witness on my acceptance of islam as a true and divine religion
6960204 reservations by these teams were a norm whenever a tour to pakistan approaches this is not good for our cricket because rest of the teams are ready to play in pakistan
6960205 look this uncertainty is affecting the players especially their preparations for the tournament everyone wants to plan ahead for a big tournament we are unable to do that not knowing where it will be held
6960206 i dont think the resignation of the board chairman nasim ashraf at this stage has helped and also the adhocism prevailing in the board sends off negative signals to other countries i think it is going to be very difficult for the icc to keep the tournament in pakistan
6960207 it is my personal view but the truth is foreign players have a certain lifestyle they like to drink as well which are neither common nor available in our country it is not easy for foreign players to sacrifice their lifestyle while coming here
6960208 he will need to take some stock hell need a couple of weeks
6960209 the plan is for him to take stock mentally and otherwise and i have advised him he needs to get back onto the field as soon as he can
6960210 one of my favourite cricketers in the world is from australia i am a huge fan of matty hayden
6960211 hes a cool customer out in the middle and i like his style
6960212 its pretty humbling for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6960213 we are supporting pakistan i think everything depends on pakistan and on what are the concern about security if they say everything is ok and the tournament can be held as per the schedule then we are with them
6960214 at the moment i can not answer this question let this situation come first there is a meeting via teleconference on august 24 in which everything will be decided
6960215 no it is not possible because we have a full series in pakistan later this year
6960216 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board has resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan for the champions trophy
6960217 we respect the right of the pcb to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6960218 my parents were preparing me for it not being as good as my first try
6960219 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6960220 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6960221 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6960222 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6960223 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6960224 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6960225 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6960226 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6960227 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6960228 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6960229 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6960230 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could
6960231 the districtwide improvement trend is extremely consistent and its overall magnitude is substantial
6960232 these increases are a powerful indicator of systematic school and curricular improvement
6960233 were a large school district so we dont see drastic dips and peaks that smaller school districts see
6960234 but to watch these numbers go up six years in a row thats really school improvement
6960235 the case involves a taxpayer supported governmental body that is being forced to defend itself against unfounded allegations of both racial discrimination and deficient education of english language learners
6960236 assuming plaintiffs allegations to be true without requiring them to present evidence to support their arguments
6960237 using the legal process thats available to us and i think thats our responsibility to make sure that we use everything thats available
6960238 we can do e mail we can do public address right now for people who are on campus
6960239 we dont have anything in place to warn people before they get here with all of the campus shooting incidents it became imperative that we need to budget for this type of system
6960240 what it tries to do is make it uniform so everybody is using the same language everybodys got the same structure
6960241 it addresses disruptive individuals or individuals that might be in depression in class and maybe even a staff member in an office
6960242 it gives samples of what might be crisis behavior for an individual and then what would be the appropriate response
6960243 its just to get that safety more forward in everybodys mind and kind of ingrain into them these are the actions that they should take
6960244 the more frequently we do that the more second nature it becomes when they actually have to respond to an emergency
6960245 we dont need anthropology because there are no primitive people in singapore
6960246 whoever fasts the month of ramadan and then follows it up by fasting six days of shawwal it is as though he has fasted the whole year
6960247 i think there are a few areas we can still improve but all round i cant blame anyone theres no point resting on our laurels though it is a long series still four more games to play
6960248 we always start well and we end up messing it up a bit so i think nottingham on tuesday is a huge fixture for us
6960249 i dont think we played our best one day game of the last two years
6960250 we showed a lot of rustiness throughout and the fact is we havent had the greatest build up to this series
6960251 there is a lot to improve on before nottingham we were way below par we know we can improve a hell of a lot and that is encouraging for us
6960252 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past
6960253 this was the first series they could not perform i feel its too harsh on them since they have been constantly performing over the last decade
6960254 to put laxman in that list is not fair since he performed well sourav and rahul although were having it tough but you cannot write them off
6960255 mendis is an exception bowler he is certain to flummox opponents with his accuracy variety and trajectory nevertheless he has to make sure he continues to improve so that he doesnt become predictable
6960256 generally the carrom ball is bowled with a tennis ball but mendis bowls it with the hard cricket ball which is relatively hard difficult and he ought to be given credit for it even my googly is based on the carrom ball as i bowled a lot of it with the tennis ball
6960257 theres a month left now before australia come in we need to have match practice and gain some confidence the irani trophy is there and lots of domestic games which should give us good match practice
6960258 his variation seems unreal he could snare 500 wickets by the time people are able to figure him out
6960259 there are few quality spinners on the horizon and im a great admirer of the spinning craft exhibited by mendis
6960260 hes not looking for dot balls hes looking for a wicket with every delivery
6960261 the way he bamboozled indias batsmen in the tests was amazing
6960262 the indian batsmen have come across a pair of top class spinners after a long time
6960263 theyll have to concentrate more and plan better to save themselves from embarrassment
6960264 it amazes me why the indian batsmen are trying to read mendis by the length of his deliveries they ought to be watching the bowlers wrist and fingers but our batsmen are trying to reach the pitch of the ball
6960265 its probably because they havent played against quality spinners over a long duration
6960266 any way how many of these indian test players regularly play domestic cricket
6960267 a lot of the indian players have had their fill
6960268 the fire in the belly seems to be diminishing and thats a dangerous sign
6960269 the arrival of twenty20 cricket in a big way has surely diverted the players attention
6960270 also they had little time to prepare for the test series and that led to the dismal performance
6960271 what ive heard is this wicket plays a little bit slow and helps spinners so its all about the captain and the coach they have to decide what to do
6960272 obviously as a player i would be looking forward to playing on any wicket on a given day
6960273 it was just about the combination of the team and i was given rest it really doesnt matter you should be prepared to give your best whenever you are given a chance
6960274 even when gary was in south africa he was following us
6960275 we were still under his guidance i think everyone was preparing very well its a matter of coming up with the goods
6960276 i fear that nasim ashraf will leave for the states soon so his name should be put on the ecl until the probe into cricket affairs is completed
6960277 i have a genuine love for cricket and tried my best to take pakistan cricket where it truly belongs
6960278 what is the relation of mens lives with religion and piety
6960279 surely the true religion with allah is islam and those to whom the book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves and whoever disbelieves in the communications of allah then surely allah is quick in reckoning 3 19
6960280 and whoever desires a religion other than islam it shall not be accepted from him and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers 3 85
6960281 o you who believe enter into submission one and all and do not follow the footsteps of shaytan satan surely he is your open enemy 2 208
6960282 and fulfil the covenant of allah when you have made a covenant and do not break the oaths after making them fast and you have indeed made allah a surety for you surely allah knows what you do 16 91
6960283 call to the way of your lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and have debates with them in the best manner surely your lord best knows those who go astray from his path and he knows best those who follow the right way 16 125
6960284 and when the quran is recited then listen to it and remain silent that mercy may be shown to you 7 204
6960285 o you who believe obey allah and obey the prophet and those in authority from among you then if you quarrel about anything refer it to allah and the prophet if you believe in allah and the last day this is better and very good in the end 4 59
6960286 thus it is due to mercy from allah that you deal with them gently and had you been rough hard hearted they would certainly have dispersed from around you pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them and take counsel with them in the affair so when you have decided then place your trust in allah surely allah loves those who trust 3 159
6960287 and how do they make you a judge and they have the tawrat wherein is allahs judgement surely we revealed tawrat in which was guidance and light with it the prophets who submitted themselves to allah judged matters for those who were jews and the masters of divine knowledge and the doctors and we sent after them in their footsteps isa jesus son of maryam mary and we gave him the injil in which was guidance and light and verifying what was before it of tawrat and the followers of the injil should have judged by what allah revealed in it and we have revealed to you the book with the truth verifying what is before it of the book and a guardian over it therefore judge between them by what allah has revealed 5 43 48
6960288 he will indeed be successful who purifies it and he will indeed fail who corrupts it 91 9 10
6960289 surely those who believe and those who are jews and the chris tians and the sabians whoever believes in allah and the last day and does good they shall have reward from their lord 2 62
6960290 surely those who disbelieve in allah and his apostles and those who desire to make a distinction between allah and his apostles and say we believe in some and disbelieve in others and desire to take a course between this and that these it is that are truly unbelievers and we have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement 4 150 151
6960291 and he is with you wherever you are 57 4
6960292 and your lord will most surely pay back to all their deeds in full 11 111
6960293 o you who believe avoid most of suspicion for surely suspicion in some cases is a sin and do not spy 49 12
6960294 surely the true religion with allah is islam 3 19
6960295 all people are a single nation so allah raised prophets as bearers of good news and as warners and he revealed with them the book with truth that it might judge between people in that which they differed 2 213
6960296 of a good word being like a good tree the root of which is firm and the branches of which are in heaven 14 24
6960297 that is the right religion but most people do not know 30 30
6960298 do not act in such a way that others may outpace you in practising the decrees of the quran
6960299 he who gave to everything its creation then guided it to its goal 20 50
6960300 and they say there is nothing but our life in this world we live and die and nothing destroys us but time and they have no knowledge of that they only conjecture 45 24
6960301 and if you should ask them who created them they would certainly say allah 43 87
6960302 and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will certainly say allah 31 25
6960303 the only factor which alleviates this affliction is allahs incessant observation of my endeavours
6960304 surely those who say our lord is allah then they continue on the right way they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve 46 13
6960305 those who believe and whose hearts are set at rest by the remembrance of allah now surely by allahs remembrance are the hearts set at rest 13 28
6960306 and what is thereafter the truth but error 10 32
6960307 most surely man is in loss except those who believe and do good and enjoin on each other truth and enjoin on each other patience 103 2 3
6960308 have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god will you then be a protector over him or do you think that most of them do hear or understand they are nothing but as cattle nay they are straying farther off from the path 25 43 44
6960309 is there doubt about allah the maker of the heavens and the earth 14 10
6960310 if there had been in them any gods except allah they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder 21 22
6960311 most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs for the believers and in your own creation and in what he spreads abroad of animals there are signs for a people that are sure and in the variation of the night and the day and in what allah sends down of sustenance from the cloud then gives life thereby to the earth after its death and in the changing of the winds there are signs for a people who understand 45 3 5
6960312 and your lord is the self sufficient one the lord of mercy 6 133
6960313 allah there is no god but he his are the very best names 20 8
6960314 glory be to him and exalted be he above what they associate with him 30 40
6960315 his is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death and he has power over all things he is the first and the last and the ascendant over all and the knower of hidden things and he is cognizant of all things 57 2 3
6960316 and allahs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them he creates what he pleases and allah has power over all things 5 17
6960317 surely allah does not do injustice to the weight of a particle 4 40
6960318 and your lord does not deal unjustly with any one 18 49
6960319 and allah does not desire injustice for his servants 40 31
6960320 whatever benefit comes to you o man it is from allah and whatever misfortune befalls you it is from yourself 4 79
6960321 who made good everything that he has created 32 7
6960322 and if you count allahs favours you will not be able to number them 14 34
6960323 and your lord is the self sufficient one the lord of mercy 6 133
6960324 our lord is he who gave to everything its creation then guided it to its goal 20 50
6960325 surely we have revealed to you as we revealed to nuh noah and the prophets after him 4 163
6960326 we sent messengers as the bearers of good news and as warners so that people should not have a plea against allah after the coming of messengers 4 165
6960327 the knower of the unseen so he does not reveal his secrets to any except to him whom he chooses as a messenger for surely he makes a guard to march before him and after him so that he may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their lord 72 26 28
6960328 and we did not send before you any messenger but we revealed to him that there is no god but me therefore worship me 21 25
6960329 he has made plain to you of the religion what he enjoined upon nuh and that which we have revealed to you and that which we enjoined upon ibrahim and musa and isa that keep to obedience and be not divided therein 42 13
6960330 there are some of them that we have mentioned to you and there are others whom we have not mentioned to you 40 78
6960331 and there is a guide for every people 13 7
6960332 peace and salutation to nuh among the nations 37 79
6960333 everybody is here except a youth who is the youngest of all
6960334 come a little bit closer i have something to tell you
6960335 i am going to ask you a question and by swearing on lat and uzza would you answer me
6960336 these two idols are the most hated ones to me
6960337 i always speak the truth and i have never told a lie you ask your question
6960338 what do you look the most at and what do you like to look at
6960339 when i fix my eyes upon the sky i see the stars and i find them in my lap and myself above them
6960340 whatever i see in dream the same i see while i am awake
6960341 may i take a look at the centre of your shoulders
6960342 listen this youth will have a very bright and astonishing future if others see what i have seen and recognize him they will kill him hide and protect him from the enemies
6960343 his eyes bear the signs of the eyes of a prominent prophet and a clear mark of prophethood is on his back
6960344 under this tree no one but a prophet from among the prophets of allah has lodged or can lodge
6960345 thats it he is the last prophet of the prophets of allah i wish i could find out the day when he will invite the people
6960346 those who follow the apostle prophet the ummi whom they find written down with them in the tawrat and the injl who enjoins them good and forbids them evil and makes lawful to them the good things and makes unlawful to them impure things and removes from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them 7 157
6960347 and when there came to them a book from allah verifying that which they already had and aforetime they were seeking victory against those who disbelieved yet when there came to them that book which they had recognized they disbelieved in it 2 89
6960348 i do not have an order from the almighty allah in this respect you must wait
6960349 they desire to put out the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light though the unbelievers may be averse 61 8
6960350 you are the best of the ummahs peoples raised up for the benefit of men you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in allah 3 100
6960351 the religion that i have brought guarantees y our worldly and heavenly prosperity and happiness
6960352 did he not find you an orphan and give you shelter and find you unable to see and show the way and find you in want and make you to be free from want 93 6 8
6960353 and you did not recite before it any book nor did you transcribe one with your right hand 29 48
6960354 and if you are in doubt as to that which we have revealed to our servant then produce a chapter like it 2 23
6960355 say o followers of the book come to an equitable proposition between us and you that we shall not serve any but allah and that we shall not associate aught with him and that some of us shall not take others for lords besides allah 3 64
6960356 say this is my way i call to allah 1 and those who follow me being certain 12 108
6960357 even if my daughter fatimah who is the most beloved of all people for me commits a theft i will cut off her hand
6960358 those who follow the messenger prophet the ummi whom they find written down with them in the tawrat and the injl who enjoins them good and forbids them evil and makes lawful to them the good things and makes unlawful to them impure things and removes from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them so as for those who believe in him and honour him and help him and follow the light which has been sent down with him these it is that are successful say o people surely i am the messenger of allah to you all 7 157 158
6960359 and most surely you conform yourself to sublime morality 68 4
6960360 what do you mean these are the customs of caesar and casra and i am for prophecy and servitude
6960361 o messenger of allah i swear by allah that my stomach is hurt and i should go for
6960362 i know that 1 will be killed today and i wanted to touch your holy body
6960363 i entrust you with two valuable things one of which is the holy book quran and the other my ahl al bayt these two will never be dissociated from each other and you will not be led astray as long as you will remain associated with them
6960364 and we have revealed the book to you explaining clearly everything 16 89
6960365 and we have revealed to you the reminder that you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them 16 44
6960366 and we have not revealed to you the book except that you may make clear to them that about which they differ 16 64
6960367 most surely it is a decisive word and it is no joke 86 13 14
6960368 and that they should not be like those who were given the book before but the time became prolonged to them so their hearts hardened 57 16
6960369 guiding to the truth and to a right path 46 30
6960370 surely this quran guides to that which is most upright 17 9
6960371 then set your face upright for religion in the right state the nature made by allah in which he has made men there is no altering of allahs creation that is the right religion 30 30
6960372 this is a book which we have revealed to you that you may bring forth men from utter darkness into light 14 1
6960373 is he who was dead then we raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth 6 122
6960374 but if they turn aside then say i have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of ad and thamud 41 13
6960375 no by allah you know that i fear none and that i have no greed you know that i am a man of letters and a litterateur the words i heard from muhammad sa bore no resemblance with the words of other people his words are attractive and charming they could neither be called poetry nor prose they are meaningful and deep rooted i am forced not to say anything about this matter until i have made my judgement give me three days time to think it over
6960376 we know best what they listen to when they listen to you and when they take counsel secretly when the unjust say you follow only a man deprived of reason 17 47
6960377 now surely they fold up their chests that they may conceal their enmity from him 11 5
6960378 dont worship stones and woods carved by yourself dont offer sacrifice of your children for them and dont believe in superstitions
6960379 and if you say surely you shall be resurrected after death those who disbelieve would certainly say this is nothing but clear magic 11 7
6960380 or do they say he has forged it nay they do not believe then let them bring an expression like it if they are truthful 52 33 34
6960381 or do they say he has forged it say then bring a surah like this and invite whom you can besides allah if you are truthful 10 38
6960382 then let them bring an announcement like it 52 34
6960383 they could not bring the like of it though some of them were aiders of others 17 88
6960384 allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you o ahl al bayt and to purify you a thorough purifying 33 33
6960385 but whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge then say come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people then let us be earnest in prayer and pray for the curse of allah on the liars 3 61
6960386 by allah i see these faces who will annihilate all the christians of the world if they turn towards allah
6960387 allah only desires to keep away the uncleanliness from you o ahl al bayt and to purify you a thorough purifying 33 33
6960388 i leave two valuable things for you which will never be separated from each other till they meet me at hawd al kawthar they are the allahs book quran and the ahl al bayt you will not go astray after me as long as you remain in touch with them intimately and seek refuge under these two
6960389 we sent messengers as the givers of good news and as warners so that people should not have a plea against allah after the coming of messengers 4 165
6960390 certainly a messenger has come to you from among yourselves grievous to him is your falling into distress excessively solicitous respecting you to the muminin he is compassionate merciful 9 128
6960391 your commander is such and such a person if he is killed then such and such will be his successor and if he is also killed so and so will act as the commander
6960392 anyone for whom i am the guardian and leader this ali as is his guardian and leader as well
6960393 there are twelve imams all of whom are from the quraysh
6960394 allah only desires to keep away the uncleanliness from you o ahl al bayt and to keep you tahir a thorough taharah 33 33
6960395 the ruler of a society should live in such a way so as to be the source of consolation for the needy and the distressed and not the cause of their regret and disappointment
6960396 if the entire arabia rises up in opposition and combat against me i will not lose my courage and i will not fear anything
6960397 we are fighting the people in order to revive such truths
6960398 this is not a time to be so meticulous about these things in such a situation when we are under the shower of arrows and the flashes of thousands of swords
6960399 we are fighting for the enforcement of such islamic precepts and insofar as the rules are concerned there is nothing large or small
6960400 i am the city of knowledge and ali is the gate of the city
6960401 the happiness of fatimah is my happiness and my happiness is the happiness of allah the anger of fatimah is my anger and my anger is the anger of allah
6960402 on the subject of the attachment of fadak and her other remarks which have remained as her memorial are all obvious proofs for the magnanimity of her status her courageous and brave spirit and her perseverance
6960403 these two sons of mine are imams and leaders be they rising or sitting
6960404 hasan and husayn are the two leaders of the youth of the heaven
6960405 i was not fighting with you for the cause of religion so that you would recite salat or observe sawm rather i wanted to rule over you and now i have achieved my goal
6960406 i disregard all the promises that i have made to al hasan
6960407 a time will come when a chaos will prevail and many of these works will be destroyed then you will be in need of these books and writings and these books will serve as the only scientific and islamic references of muslims
6960408 he aroused an amazing enthusiasm among the people all through his journey particularly in iran the people rushed from everywhere to meet him eagerly surrounded him and learned the teachings and precepts of islam
6960409 does not man see that we have created him from the sperm then lo he is an open disputant and he strikes out a likeness for us and forgets his own creation says he who will give life to the bones when they are rotten say he will give life to them who brought them into existence at first and he is cognizant of all creation 36 77 79
6960410 and among his signs is this that you see the earth still but when we send down on it the water it stirs and swells most surely he who gives it life is the giver of life to the dead surely he has power over all things 41 39
6960411 and we did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain that is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of the fire shall we treat those who believe and do good like the mischief makers on the earth or shall we make those who guard against evil like the wicked 38 27 28
6960412 and certainly we created man of an extract of clay then we made him a sperm in a firm resting place then we made the sperm a clot then we made the clot a lump of flesh then we made in the lump of flesh bones then we covered the bones with flesh then we caused it to grow into another creation 23 12 14
6960413 and they say what when we have become lost in the earth shall we then certainly be in a new creation nay they are disbelievers in the meeting of their lord say the angel of death who is given charge of you shall cause you to die
6960414 you shall not be perished but you shall be transferred from one house to another
6960415 and before them is barzakh until the day they are raised 23 100
6960416 and reckon not those who are killed in allahs way as dead nay they are alive and are provided sustenance from their lord 3 169
6960417 most surely man is in loss except those who believe and do good and enjoin on each other truth and enjoin on each other patience 103 2 3
6960418 corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men have wrought 30 41
6960419 therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon our reminder and does not desire anything but this worlds life that is their goal of knowledge 53 29 30
6960420 and your lord has commanded that you shall not serve any but him 17 23
6960421 did i not charge you o children of adam that you should not serve the shaytan surely he is your open enemy and that you should serve me this is the right way 36 60 61
6960422 o you who believe obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority from among you 4 59
6960423 and whoever respects the signs of allah this surely is the outcome of the piety of hearts 22 32
6960424 carnal desires will be low and insignificant to whoever respects himself
6960425 taking a bath every other day makes man healthy and stout
6960426 bathroom is a very good place since it removes the dirtiness of man
6960427 washing garments relieves one from grief and anxiety and neat clothes are a means for acceptance of his
6960428 put on beautiful clothes and dress yourself up for allah is good and likes the good things but these should be religiously lawful
6960429 say who has prohibited the embellishment of allah which he has brought forth for his servants and the good provisions 7 32
6960430 if it were not for the fear of hardship and indigence i would have made brushing the teeth wajib upon muslims
6960431 jibril always recommended brushing the teeth to an extent that i even imagined it would become incumbent upon the muslims later on
6960432 and the soul and him who made it pure then he inspired it to understand what is right and wrong for it he will indeed be successful who purifies it and he will indeed fail who corrupts it 91 7 10
6960433 the almighty allah has revealed to man the things which are good for him and must be put into effect and the things which are bad for him and must be avoided
6960434 go for seeking knowledge even if it may be in china i e far away
6960435 knowledge is the most valuable thing that the believer has lost he should go after it even if he finds it in china the farthest points in the world
6960436 knowledge is what a believer has lost he must get it back from wherever he finds
6960437 he who is engaged in acquiring knowledge is loved by allah
6960438 and it does not beseem the believers that they should go forth all together why should not then a section from every group from among them go forth that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion and that they may warn their people when they come back to them that they may be cautious 9 122
6960439 he who taught me a word has indeed made me his slave
6960440 the people are divided into three groups the first group consists of the
6960441 allah will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge in high degrees 58 11
6960442 the death of a tribe is easier and less detrimental than the death of a scholar
6960443 are those who know and those who do not know alike only the men of understanding are mindful 39 9
6960444 a scholar who puts his knowledge into use is superior to seventy thousand worshippers and has preference over them
6960445 the most learned man is one who adds to his own knowledge by deriving benefit from the knowledge of others the value of man is determined by his knowledge thus the more knowledgeable a man is the more valuable he is and also the less knowledgeable a man is the less valuable he is
6960446 surely those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that we revealed after we made it clear in the book for men these it is whom allah shall curse and those who curse shall curse them too 2 159
6960447 and follow not that of which you have not the knowledge 17 36
6960448 and your lord has commanded that you shall not serve any but him and has commanded goodness to your parents 17 23
6960449 if either or both of them reach old age with you say not to them so much as
6960450 the glorification and respect for the elders is the glorification and respect for allah
6960451 and be careful of your duty to allah by whom you demand one of another your rights and to the ties of relationship surely allah ever watches over you 4 1
6960452 i enjoin my ummah people to observe the kinship bonds with kindness even if the relatives are separated from one another by a year long distance they should not disconnect the kinship bonds of their relationship
6960453 jibril recommended to me about the neighbours to such an extent that i thought the almighty allah would appoint ones neighbour as one of his heirs
6960454 whoever believes in allah and in maad never does injustice to his neighbour lends him money if he asks for it and shares his grief and happiness one should not annoy his neighbour even if he is an unbeliever
6960455 he who hurts his neighbour will not smell the fragrance of paradise and he who disregards the rights of his neighbour is not my follower whoever has had enough to eat and does not help his neighbour after knowing that he is hungry is not a muslim
6960456 by no means shall you attain to righteousness until you spend benevevolently out of what you love 3 92
6960457 the best of men is one who is more beneficial for the people
6960458 in maad a person who has taken greater steps towards charitable acts for the servants of allah will be placed in a higher status before the almighty allah
6960459 a muslim is one from whose hand and tongue muslims are safe
6960460 muslims are brothers and are like a single hand single heart and single direction against aliens
6960461 whoever does not care about the affairs of the muslims is not a muslim
6960462 and that when you judge between people you judge with justice 4 58
6960463 surely allah does not guide the unjust people 6 144
6960464 monarchy and kingdom will last with blasphemy but these will not stabilise with tyranny and oppression
6960465 and when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a better greeting than it or return it 4 86
6960466 and the servants of the beneficent allah are they who walk on the earth in humbleness 25 63
6960467 one should not commit a sin before allah for the sake of obeying others
6960468 and those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing women without their having earned it they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin 33 58
6960469 whoever bothers a muslim has bothered me and bothering me is bothering allah such a person has been cursed in the tawrat the injil and the quran
6960470 one who casts an angry glance on a muslim and frightens him will be frightened by allah on the day of judgement
6960471 your best friend is the one who leads you to do good deeds
6960472 man is evaluated on the basis of the friends he chooses
6960473 shun the companionship of bad people for a bad friend makes you similar to himself unless he succeeds in this respect he will not accept you as a friend
6960474 avoid the friendship of an evildoer for he will sell you for a trivial thing
6960475 a true muslim is one who prefers truthfulness although it may be to his detriment over falsehood from which he may benefit and gets internal satisfaction as a result of this preference
6960476 three groups of people are munafiqin even if they recite salat and observe sawm they are the liars those who do not keep their promise and those who are disloyal to what they are entrusted with
6960477 man derives pleasure from his faith when he gives up falsehood even he should give up his lying which may be for fun sake
6960478 nor let some of you backbite others does one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother 49 12
6960479 only they forge the lie who do not believe 16 105
6960480 whatever you spend in the way of allah is to your own advantage
6960481 whatever you spend in the way of allah will be returned unto you and you will not sustain a loss
6960482 two things provide man with honour a righteous child and standing charity
6960483 and reckon not those who are killed in allahs way as dead nay they are alive and are provided sustenance from their lord 3 169
6960484 there is always a good deed surpassing other good deeds but no good deed can surpass martyrdom
6960485 and whoever shall turn his back to them on that day unless he shall turn aside for the sake of fighting or withdraws to a company then he indeed becomes deserving of allahs wrath and his abode is hell 8 16
6960486 and do not speak of those who are killed in allahs way as dead nay they are alive but you do not perceive 2 154
6960487 guiding to the truth and to a right path 46 30
6960488 say o my servants who have acted extravagantly against their own souls do not despair of the mercy of allah surely allah forgives the faults altogether surely he is the forgiving the merciful 39 53
6960489 and those who restrain their anger and pardon men 3 134
6960490 and as for the man who steals and the woman who steals cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have earned 5 38
6960491 woe to the defrauders do not these think that they shall be raised again for a mighty day 83 1 4 5
6960492 and that man shall have nothing but what he strives for 53 39
6960493 even during the war when soldiers array in line and when the fire of battle is fanned do not neglect your economic duty and necessary activities for providing your subsistence and follow your financial efforts in such difficult situations
6960494 do not show sluggishness and tiredness in your work or else you will lose in this world and in the
6960495 farmers would enjoy more respectable positions than others on the day of
6960496 there is no job better than farming and there is no benefit better than the benefit of farming because benevolents and malevolents grazing animals and birds benefit from it and pray for the farmer
6960497 a muslim who plants a tree or cultivates a land from which people birds and grazing animals eat will have the reward of
6960498 if at the time when the world is to come to an end and the solar system is to collapse any one of you has a small plant in hand he should plant it if he has enough time to do so
6960499 curse and imprecation of allah be upon one who has land and water i e one who has natural resources at his disposal but does not use his human skill to take advantage of them and consequently lives in poverty and beggary
6960500 what has brought you into hell they shall say we were not of those who recited salat 74 42 43
6960501 prayer is the pillar of faith if it is accepted by allah the other worships will also be accepted and if it is not accepted the other worships will not be accepted either
6960502 so woe to the ones who recite salat but unmindful of their salawat 107 4 5
6960503 if this man dies in this condition he will not die as a muslim
6960504 surely the salat keeps one away from indecency and evil 29 45
6960505 i recite four rakaat sections of salat of salat al zuhr with the intention of seeking pleasure of allah
6960506 rabbana atina fiddunya hasanah wa fil akhirati hasanah waqina adhabannar
6960507 ashhadu an la ilaha illalah wahdahu la sharika lah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ali muhammad
6960508 assalamu alayka ayyuhan nabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh assalamu alayna wa ala ibadillahissalihin assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh
6960509 the sawm is for me and i will give reward for it
6960510 o jabir this is the month of ramadan and the one who has sawm during the day and stays awake at night to commune with allah abstains from eating haram food and guards against evils and using abusive language gets out of sins as he leaves the month of ramadan behind
6960511 o prophet sa of allah what a good news is it
6960512 o jabir how demanding and exacting are the conditions for the
6960513 the sawm serves as a strong shield against the fire of the hell
6960514 o people the month of allah along with its blessings and salvation has revealed itself to you it is a month which is regarded as the best of all the months by allah its days nights and hours are the best of all it is a month in which you are invited to be the guest of allah and are entitled to his favour and generosity
6960515 if you resort to allah in this month and worship him allah will grant your prayers therefore with all your truthfulness and sincerity and with a pure heart pray to allah to grant you his divine dispensations for having sawm and reciting the holy quran for one who remains deprived of the forgiveness and blessings of allah in this bountiful and blessed month is indeed unfortunate
6960516 o you who believe the sawm is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may have taqwa 2 183
6960517 o you who believe be maintainers of justice bearers of witness for allahs sake though it may be against your own selves or your parents or near relatives 4 135
6960518 tell the truth though it may be against your own interests
6960519 i owe one thousand rials to such and such a person
6960520 allah has not declared any eatable or drinkable halal unless it is to the benefit and for the welfare of man neither has he declared any haram unless it is the source of mans detriment death and corruption
6960521 he who cultivates a barren land is entitled to the ownership of that land
6960522 any group of people who develop and cultivate a land will have the preference and that land will belong to them
6960523 i think shes capable of winning a medal certainly in terms of looking at the times she is able to run she is up there

6960575 a fool takes no pleasure in understanding but only in expressing his opinion
6960576 the words of a mans mouth are deep waters the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook
6960577 a fools lips walk into a fight and his mouth invites a beating a fools mouth is his ruin and his lips are a snare to his soul
6960578 if one gives an answer before he hears it is his folly and shame
6960579 a false witness will not go unpunished and he who breathes out lies will perish
6960580 whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets therefore do not associate with a simple babbler
6960581 the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death

6960637 ever since i turned 35 the battle of the bulge has turned into a rout gut 1 patrick 0
6960638 the syndrome is associated with eight degenerative diseases the first is overweight disorder then high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar then you have type two diabetes cardiovascular diseases heart attacks and strokes four kinds of cancer breast prostate colon endometrial osteoarthritis and finally gall bladder disease all this is basically because people eat too many carbohydrates thats partly because its the cheapest food and also because the food industry keeps throwing sugar into everything to make it taste good
6960639 healthy cells contain proteins that span the entire charge spectrum from negatively charged proteins to positively charged protein health means that theres a balance between negatively charged proteins and positively charged proteins this is essential for core body health because the 25 000 proteins in the body are its worker bees
6960640 the synthesis of negatively charged proteins continues but the synthesis of positively charged proteins is greatly diminished and this impairs cell function causing further disease all foods made in bulk in nature contain negatively charged proteins things like whey soy casein and egg white and when we get meat at the store its usually muscle which is also mainly negatively charged proteins
6960641 unless of course you eat like your grandparents did tripe kidney or stomach you get much more of a protein balance from organ meat but people dont eat all that much of it anymore
6960642 you could make up for a positively charged protein deficiency by eating protein with an overall negative charge
6960643 eleven are nonessential meaning our body makes them and nine are essential meaning our body doesnt make them and we must get them from our diets as we age there are two things that prevent us from getting those essential amino acids we fall into poor eating habits taking in lots of carbohydrates and less protein rich food and also the aging process interferes with the digestive process leading to further deficiencies in amino acids and positively charged proteins i call this the food chain gap
6960644 by the end of the first week you have more pep and energy
6960645 reset the metabolic pathways and thats why you get more pep and energy plus it burns calories they can even improve mood three of those amino acids are direct precursors to neurotransmitters in the brain two of them are dopamine and serotonin which are related to pleasure this means they can also relieve stress anxiety mood swings and depression because they reach the brain within minutes the amino acids also signal the brains appetite centers that the body is well fed and that leads to feelings of comfort satisfaction and well being
6960646 i used to get three viruses a year but ive been using factor4 weight control for two and a half years and i dont get sick anymore
6960647 anti aging health living longer with improved quality of life
6960648 with factor 4 hair and nails grow twice as fast and skin has more blood supply and elasticity these things lead to a more youthful look
6960649 laserfiche has helped our it division deploy several cutting edge technologies already and i believe that in the coming year our service offerings will rival those of any city of any size
6960650 we needed a centralized document repository so staff could quickly gather needed information we also needed to maintain our records retention policies some of which are very complex but most of all we needed an easy to use system that users could adopt quickly
6960651 50 percent of the time some step of the process had a mistake which was very labor intensive to correct
6960652 but it didnt address remittances which are half the transactional data other systems were cost prohibitive and couldnt
6960653 im looking forward to facing someone other than joe inglett leading off the game
6960654 and ill be excited when lyle overbay wont be in the lineup recognizing everything that comes out of my hand
6960655 it was six innings of survival but my team picked me up and scored a lot of runs and made me comfortable and when i gave up a few they answered
6960656 i kissed a girl was inspired when i opened up a magazine and i saw a picture of scarlett johansson
6960657 i was with my boyfriend at the time and i said to him im not going to lie if scarlett johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me i would make out with her
6960658 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
6960659 i have never reviewed a book i enjoyed as much as this one excellent coverage perfect for the intended audience concise clear accurate descriptions this is a winner
6960660 i almost forgot about it i forgot it was our dream and i dont want to forget about that
6960661 escape 9 5 live anywhere and join the new rich
6960662 there are so many accusations about protesters being the problem at the dnc were there to speak out but were not disturbing the peace its u s policy thats disturbing the peace and were looking to disturb the war
6960663 softening on the idea of ending the war and stopping the violence
6960664 we found them theyre closer to home than you think
6960665 its more personal than a bumper sticker because you have a real person standing there in the line at the grocery store or post office
6960666 a time too late for protest comes no nukes now
6960667 theyre politically correct and speak to the issues without being offensive
6960668 be the change you wish to see in the world
6960669 bootstour hier in bremen station evtl kann ich dann doch noch etwas neues berichten
6960670 a tarefa de interpretar corretamente a palavra de deus foi confiada unicamente ao magist rio da igreja isto ao papa e aos bispos que est o em comunh o com ele
6960671 voc s poder brincar comigo se aceitar que sou o nico que tem raz o
6960672 a tarefa de interpretar a palavra de deus autenticamente foi confiada unicamente ao papa
6960673 amados n o creias a todo o esp rito mas provai se os esp ritos s o de deus porque j muitos falsos profetas se t m levantado no mundo
6960674 quem jugar a humanidade no dia do ju zo final
6960675 e tamb m o pai a ningu m julga mas deu ao filho todo o ju zo
6960676 e a condena o esta que a luz veio ao mundo e os homens amaram mais as trevas do que a luz porque as suas obras eram m s
6960677 se por m os teus olhos forem maus o teu corpo ser tenebroso se portanto a luz que em ti h s o trevas qu o grandes ser o tais trevas
6960678 se o rg o que te d a capacidade de ver a luz estiver em trevas cego ent o voc realmente estar em grandes trevas
6960679 maitreya o instrutor do mundo j est vivendo entre n s
6960680 o mundo ver seu rosto na televis o mas cada um escutar suas palavras telepaticamente em sua pr pria l ngua enquanto maitreya impressionar simultaneamente as mentes de toda a humanidade inclusive aqueles que n o estiverem vendo a cena pela tev ou n o ouvindo o pelo r dio ter o a experi ncia
6960681 maitreya irm o maior da fam lia humana que tem aperfei oado e se manifestado totalmente dentro da divindade que latente em cada um dos homens
6960682 e agora ele vem revelar um novo aspecto de deus e guiar toda a humanidade atrav s da nova fase de sua viagem espiritual
6960683 na palestina h dois mil anos maitreya j trabalhava por meio de seu disc pulo jesus
6960684 desde o momento do batismo de jesus no rio jord o at sua crucifica o a consci ncia de maitreya estava em cristo este ali s o processo utilizado s vezes entre os mestres e seus disc pulos como um meio para apresentar um novo ensinamento a humanidade
6960685 como o nome sugere uma s plica emocional divindade para que supra nossas necessidades di rias de alimento e de prote o passiva pede se a deus que se traga tudo implicando com isso que deus est separado do homem
6960686 um poderoso mantra mediante o qual por meio de seus representantes buddha o cristo e shamballa s o invocados conscientemente as energias de deus para uma compreens o de suas id ias e de sua vontade
6960687 a ora o para a nova era uma afirma o com efeito invocativo e ser um instrumento poderoso para o reconhecimento por parte do homem de que ele e deus s o um quando o homem afirma que criador do universo pode chegar finalmente a consci ncia de que deus
6960688 ningu m de maneira alguma vos engane pois isto a segunda volta de jesus terra n o acontecer sem que antes venha a apostasia e se manifeste o homem do pecado o filho da perdi o ele se op e e se levanta contra tudo o que se chama deus ou objeto de culto de sorte que se assentar como deus querendo parecer deus e ent o ser revelado o in quo a quem o senhor desfar pelo sopro da sua boca e aniquilar pelo esplendor de sua vinda a vinda desse in quo segundo a efic cia de satan s com todo poder e sinais e prod gios da mentira e com todo engano de injusti a para os que perecem perecem porque n o receberam o amor da verdade para se salvarem por isso deus lhes envia a opera o do erro para que creiam na mentira e para que sejam julgados todos os que n o creram na verdade antes tiveram prazer na iniquidade
6960689 disse lhe jesus eu sou o caminho e a verdade e a vida ningu m vem ao pai sen o por mim
6960690 o que vemos aqui uma analogia ao ritual de inicia o ma nico onde o candidato a aprendiz anda vendado e o gr o mestre lhe questiona
6960691 um s mbolo sinistro usado por satanistas no s culo vi que foi novamente colocado em uso ao tempo do conc lio vaticano ii nessa cruz vergada existe uma figura repulsiva e distorcida de cristo que os praticantes de magia negra e feiticeiros da idade m dia criaram para representar o termo b blico marca da besta entretanto n o somente paulo vi mas seus sucessores jo o paulo i e jo o paulo ii carregavam esse objeto e o exibiam para ser reverenciado pelas multid es que n o tinham a menor id ia que representa o anticristo
6960692 porque haver ent o grande afli o como nunca houve desde o princ pio do mundo at agora nem tampouco h de haver
6960693 mas o dia do senhor vir como o ladr o de noite no qual os c us passar o com grande estrondo e os elementos ardendo se desfar o e a terra e as obras que nela h se queimar o

6960696 he is a good kid and hes had a very very hard life
6960697 hes been through a lot its just a horrible situation i feel for that family i do i do
6960698 can we find a grandma or someone from the extended family while we continue working with families that can keep the child safe while we work with the parents
6960699 when it comes to putting them in foster care we really are looking at the worst of the worst children who are right now in immediate danger and we cant put enough services in the home to keep them safe
6960700 day in and day out in this community we see a lot of drugs
6960701 the judge was just commenting earlier today that almost all the cases in which weve been freeing children for adoption crack cocaine is an issue and if we dont get crack cocaine under control were going to have much more serious problems
6960702 the pakistani army absolutely understands its priority is not india but is internal
6960703 some of the thinking in the army is in accordance with what petraeus has done in iraq
6960704 they see the need for quick impact projects such as those funded by u s army commanders in troubled iraqi districts
6960705 weve all got a kind of love hate relationship with the university of washington
6960706 affects the health safety or security of any member of the university community or the mission of the university
6960707 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6960708 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6960709 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6960710 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6960711 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6960712 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6960713 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6960714 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6960715 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6960716 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6960717 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6960718 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6960719 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6960720 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6960721 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6960722 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6960723 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work
6960724 this action allows us to rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6960725 i keep thinking you all have better things to do on a friday afternoon
6960726 i dont really comment on my phone calls and ive told you for months all the comments about this process and the discussions are really coming from the campaign
6960727 a lot of us are going to focus on the fact that the country is facing some real challenges
6960728 families around this state and states across the country are struggling to pay for gas and pay their bills
6960729 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6960730 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6960731 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6960732 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
6960733 i wanted to buy back america and lease it to the whites
6960734 sweating the small stuff inner city schools and the new paternalism
6960735 everyone says we should preserve our culture there is a lot of our culture we should wipe out
6960736 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6960737 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6960738 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6960739 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6960740 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6960741 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6960742 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6960743 more time should be given to guarantee that all the bidders can provide the air force with the best options possible
6960744 this is a large procurement and the response time is just inadequate
6960745 we know that there are a lot of students looking for a christian community and we want to be able to let them know that we are a community available for them to join to have fellowship and to grow in
6960746 also most students will make their commitments at the beginning of the semesters so getting them to commit early to something like we have means that there is a better chance that they will stay through their time at ku
6960747 within the first 30 days students are pretty well checking things out and determining what they are going to be using their time for and so we try to make those contacts within the first 30 days we actually aim for the first two weeks
6960748 were right next to campus and we probably have 1 000 or more students walk through our sidewalk every day to get to class from the dorms because its the quickest way
6960749 the location is particularly beneficial since gas prices are high so a lot of students are sensitive to stay closer to campus or walk
6960750 i think also the traffic patterns along kentucky help us we are very visible for those on campus
6960751 the technique we are working with can tell the difference between healthy enamel and decaying enamel and so in the future if this technology is further developed a dentist could identify early decay using it
6960752 however that is not to say dentist drills would become obsolete
6960753 i think there will always be those of us who like our sweets a bit too much and visit the dentist too infrequently to keep them in business
6960754 anything that means that there might be fewer filling materials used in the mouth is a tremendously positive development
6960755 i salute any technology that will scan the mouth and prevent cavities before they occur so we can try to have the least intervention in the mouth as possible
6960756 its quickly becoming a very popular way to build next generation applications theres a lot of interest in capturing the hearts and minds of developers
6960757 with the unemployment rate getting so high its harder to find work and thats not helping the agencies that are here to help are overwhelmed with people who need food and shelter
6960758 he always made fire come out of it it was propane
6960759 we had an employee working in the area and heard an explosion there was a bang
6960760 we have done an amazing job of turning this building around the old management regime is no longer here some of the people who contributed to the demise of the facility are no longer here
6960761 basically all the citations received in april were due to the previous administration not following federal and state guidelines
6960762 surveyors is a term we use within the department for those who go out and look at health care in nursing homes investigators implies a police presence which was not the case
6960763 at this point they are under investigation and there is no further information about what was uncovered everything else is confidential
6960764 as the term implies this means someone is in immediate jeopardy or actual harm
6960765 not necessarily it can come from any situation including equipment malfunction
6960766 the state has been very pleased with our facility and very supportive of all our efforts
6960767 i would invite anyone in the community to visit us to meet the staff and residents and to see how well we are doing were an open book this is a great place and a great place to be
6960768 he knows his doctors its like second nature to him unfortunately
6960769 he wakes up every day with a smile on his face
6960770 it makes it hard for us not to do the same
6960771 its just going to get more and more hectic the closer it gets to october
6960772 oh no daddy i dont think i like this at all this is really very unsatisfactory
6960773 come on i just need to change your nappy this happens every day youd think youd be used to it now
6960774 well i dont like it i want mummy to do it mummy is better than you
6960775 alice thats a really hurtful thing to say im not sure i even want to change your nappy if thats the way you look at it we work our bloody fingers to the bone we do im really quite upset i thought better of you
6960776 get a free phone charger with a little social engineering
6960777 the thing is in order for people to know you and respect you as a good contributor you have to seek out other users with good stories
6960778 what if my hard drive got erased and i lost all of my music
6960779 in the event that a customers entire music library is lost the itunes music store does re grant the purchases history please keep in mind that apple does not offer protection against the loss of purchases so this is a one time exception
6960780 we dont allow redownload of the full purchase history this redownload of one file is a one time exception
6960781 well now you can hold this to them when you lose all of you music
6960782 in the event that a customers entire music library is lost the itunes music store does re grant the purchases history please keep in mind that apple does not offer protection against the loss of purchases so this is a one time exception
6960783 in the event that a customers entire music library is lost the itunes music store does re grant the purchases history
6960784 in the event that a customers entire music library is lost the itunes music store does re grant the purchases history please keep in mind that apple does not offer protection against the loss of purchases so this is a one time exception
6960785 in the event that a customers entire music library is lost the itunes music store does re grant the purchases history
6960786 this song can not play on this computer because you did not buy it from this computer
6960787 we are not called to be conformist practioners not subversive insurgents but transforming professionals
6960788 the odds against our centurys happening to be the present century are the same as the odds against a penny tossed out at random on the road from london to istanbul happening to fall on a particular ant
6960789 we thought your machine was dangerous after all it uses electricity and it gets very hot
6960790 its supposed to get hot and use electricity if it didnt it wouldnt be a toaster
6960791 and that the second place kid didnt invent radar he just cut out some pictures of radar antennas and glued them to a poster board
6960792 science should be the most exciting subject on the school curriculum scientific controversies and breakthroughs hit the headlines every day but school science can be so boring it puts young people off science for life
6960793 ive had my heart broken and its not fun but id rather have my heart broken than break someone elses heart
6960794 im not good at asking for dates i wait for them to make their move
6960795 this is how a country singer should treat their fans
6960796 everythings gonna be alright in the end if its not alright its not the end
6960797 soon to be a major motion picture starring jimmy osmond
6960798 the main task now for obama is reassurance that he could handle the job especially commander in chief
6960799 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
6960800 yeah you dropped my phone number want to get it
6960801 personal and striking and deceptively simple yet packed with information and emotion
6960802 actiunea romaniei la haga a fost deschisa impotriva ucrainei pentru delimitarea platoului continental al romaniei in marea neagra iar contenciosul este legat de masurarea acestui platou continental
6960803 romania nu are un proces cu ucraina prin care revendica insula serpilor
6960804 i believe i can fly i believe i can touch the sky
6960805 you thought that was amazing wait until you get this
6960806 thats not why im saying chow funs funs im saying chow funs because were an us theres a history here and histories dont happen overnight in mesopotamia or ancient troy there are cities built on top of other cities but i dont want another city i like this city i know what kind of mood your in when you wake up by which eyebrow is higher and you know im a little quiet in the morning and compensate accordingly thats a dance you perfect over time and its hard its much harder than i thought it would be but theres more good than bad and you dont just give up and its not for the sake of the children but god theyre great kids arent they and we made them i mean think about that its like there were no people there and then there were people and they grew and an an an i wont be able to say to some stranger josh has your hands or remember how erin threw up at the lincoln memorial and ill try to relax lets face it anybody is going to have traits that get on your nerves i mean why shouldnt it be your annoying traits and i know im no day at the beach but i do have a good sense of direction so i can at least find the beach which isnt a weakness of yours its a strength of mine and god your a good friend and good friends are hard to find charlotte said that in charlottes web and i love how you read that to erin and you take on the voice of wilber the pig with such dedication even when your bone tired that speaks volumes about character and ultimately isnt that what it comes down too what a person is made of that girl in the pin helmet is still here bee boo bee boo i didnt even know she existed until you and im afraid if you leave i may never see her again even though i said at times you beat her out of me isnt that the paradox havent we hit the essential paradox give and take push and pull the yen the yang the best of times the worst of times i think dickens said it best he could eat no fat his wife could eat no lean but doesnt really apply here does it what im trying to say is im saying chow funs because i love you
6960807 you never get my calls i lost the ball and am going to find it come and get me
6960808 since you didnt write a book yet the only thing i can imitate about your game is the blueberries
6960809 the world shall never find out what we have done to them
6960810 at the order of the revolutionary headquarters we are instructed to execute you and all of your family
6960811 they brought in stretchers and laid the bodies on them the first to be carried out was the tsars body all of the arrested were lying on the floor bleeding profusely the heir was still seated on the chair for some reason he took a long time to fall to the floor and was still alive they started shooting him in the head and directly in the chest finally he slipped off the chair and crumpled to the floor the corpses were carried out and loaded onto a truck waiting in the yard the second to be placed on the stretcher was one of the daughters of the emperor but she turned out to be still alive and started shouting and covering her face with her hands besides also alive were another one of the daughters and the woman who had been in attendance on the royal family so then comrade yermakov seeing that i was holding a bayonet suggested that i stab to death those still remaining alive i refused so he grabbed the bayonet from me and began stabbing them himself he used such force that on every occasion the bayonet plunged deep into the floor
6960812 the world is ruled not by those the people believe to be governing them the people have no real idea of what takes place behind the scenes there exists a political force that is rarely mentioned i am referring to clandestine societies it is impossible to conceal and as such pointless to deny that a significant part of europe is covered by a network of such secret societies in the manner of how todays earth is covered with a network of railroads they strive to destroy all institutions of the church
6960813 it is a great sin to raise ones hand against the anointed sovereign not even the slightest accessory to such a sin can go without due punishment
6960814 together with my colleague aleksandr khabarov we conducted something of an investigation
6960815 i filmed the episode featuring tsarevich aleksei it was a calm summer day suddenly a terrifying wind arose becoming a veritable storm i felt extremely ill at ease at this point my cameraman vladimir chervyakov who was doing the filming yelled that the camera wasnt working we were forced to make a 15 minute break then we switched the camera back on and began filming but the wind came upon us again and yet again the camera went dead so then we got our stuff together and quickly left the place the taxi driver who incidentally had an amazing resemblance to yurovsky a mystical coincidence no less drove us to the yekaterinburg tv studios we started looking at the material wed filmed and suddenly saw that most of the film was defective it had lines and murky spots running across its entire length we decided that it was due to a faulty camera and sent the latter to moscow to replace it but after checking our equipment the moscow technicians could see no evidence of malfunctioning so it must have been some other force that prevented us from making the film back then generally the more i tried to find out the more often i got the feeling that i was beating against a rubber wall it simply wouldnt let me go further i believe that many high ranking party authorities of the time were well informed about the real events yet they kept silence even during the forensic study of the remains allegedly belonging to the royal family there were many inconsistencies which the countrys leadership was duly informed about but all this too was classified i think it was done so that doubts remained so that one could always play political games using this tragedy as a pawn so we should do everything we can to bring the truth into the open i believe that to be a russian person means to know and comprehend ones history
6960816 the worst evil that people could do to the tsar was committed in gods presence yet this worst evil could not conquer him
6960817 the cross is not the end the resurrection follows after the glory of resurrection changed everything
6960818 orang orang yang kemarin melakukan aksi beli kemarin mengambil untung pada hari ini selain itu terdapat juga technical selling baru dan pembicaraan lagi tentang prospek permintaan dolar as juga semakin menguat lagi
6960819 mercredi de la semaine derni re les gardiens ont remarqu que claudio le b b the independent il avait peine quelque chose boire vendredi et il est simplement devenu de plus en plus faible il est mort samedi
6960820 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6960821 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6960822 we will definitely try our utmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6960823 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6960824 all the three ships are still moving and appear to be heading toward somali territorial water a warship has been dispatched to monitor and track the vessels
6960825 there have been a lot of gunmen joining the pirate gangs they are making good business and it is an attractive choice for many young men at the moment
6960826 they may have a flag of one country be owned by a second and have a crew from a third which adds a lot of complications to trying to free the vessels
6960827 spain is practically an exception already in south africa in guatemala cyprus timor it has been the state
6960828 instead of guaranteeing human rights the state is delegating to a group of volunteers
6960829 we never said we were going to donate money for the campaign we paid for the hall and the entertainers and the surplus we said would be spent on advertisements aimed at persuading nigerians to tell their relatives in america to register to vote
6960830 we want to make it clear that the event and this organization are in no way associated with obama for america or the democratic national committee should this organization seek to place additional advertisements in your paper
6960831 we are gathering up to 4 000 people together for a fund raising to support obama 08 the funds raised will be sent to the obama campaign office as our own way of showing support for obama since we are not eligible to vote as we are nigerians based in nigeria and not in america

6960833 gori georgia columns of hulking smoke belching russian tanks rolled out of key positions deep inside georgia friday as moscow declared it had pulled its forces out following the worst confrontation between the kremlin and the west since the soviet collapse

6960837 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

6960843 do not be afraid mary you have found favor with god do you think think that st john the divine knew when he wrote revelations apocolaypse that is would be last will satan appear in my grilled cheese if i play the jonas brothers music backwards ecommission
6960844 we only have four seniors on defense you never know what to expect
6960845 i was really impressed with the kids they kind of stepped up
6960846 i dont care what you hear if you dont turn the ball over you are going to win football games we won the turnover battle 21 0
6960847 that is one of our main plays and im looking for the tight end as my main read
6960848 it felt good to finally get a chance to prove myself
6960849 weve been very fortunate in my years here that we have almost always had a two year starter
6960850 tim waited for his time and had a great game
6960851 they kind of struggled in the preseason i think they are going to have a good year
6960852 they had so many weapons but i think we showed were a little quicker on defense we played better as a team it was a team victory not an individual victory in building a program it was a major step
6960853 when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6960854 they were all catchers who were good offensive players molina said
6960855 were trying to do all we can to keep him in the lineup said manager bruce bochy adding that sandoval who went 2 for 4 to raise his average to 458 would start behind the plate today
6960856 you should see bengie when he takes his shirt off a teammate said
6960857 i want to be out there every day and i do the best with what i have
6960858 it takes a while for a catcher to get his legs under him giants vice president dick tidrow said
6960859 its the same situation weve been in all year bochy said
6960860 nope afghanistan doesnt have a team again said left hander alex hinshaw whose mother was born near kabul
6960861 he bent down to pick it up to see what it was and he said it really freaked him out
6960862 i said well that looks like an artillery round to me you better put it on the ground
6960863 i got up and the sheriff was at my door asking me to leave so they could clear it out
6960864 it just made me really scared about my kids being outside
6960865 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6960866 in notes for a correspondence with the art historian gordon brown rita angus had left her clearly stated opinion that the real biography of an artist lies not in any words but in the work
6960867 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6960868 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6960869 their milf positions are military targets the civilians have left that accounts for the number of idps internally displaced persons that has increased
6960870 sana ang gawin ng military ay magkaroon ng tinatawag na surgical strikes lamang hindi yung general ang atake na ginagawa huwag sana yung indiscriminate firing para hindi naman ma apektuhan ang mga civilians
6960871 sana ay maging mahinahon sila dahil ang talagang ina alala namin dito ay yung mga sibilyan huwag na lang sana air strikes ang gawin nila dapat yung man to man ang labanan harapan ba kung air strikes kasi masyadong madami ang civilians na apektado hindi na justified
6960872 all s 211 ov 10 and sf 260 airplanes delivered bombs and rockets
6960873 thats the information from the civilians plus the observation of the troops because when we request for air support and artillery we observe the fires
6960874 the firing of the artillery mortar and close air support is very accurate
6960875 these are the cluster of towns where our battalions under the 601st brigade have been engaging the enemy heavily there have been calls for fire from the artillery and our air assets so there have been a series of sorties and artillery fires
6960876 based on their assessments we have been inflicting heavy casualty
6960877 for the past two and a half days we have made contact with the group of umbra kato and our forces as we speak are heavily engaged
6960878 our commanders have been reporting that they have been occupying their objectives overrunning them inflicting heavy casualty in the process
6960879 while there have been resistance the rebel groups there have been running around because wherever they withdraw they bump into some of our battalions
6960880 some of them are satellite camps some of them are abandoned camps but the order to us is to pursue and hit them wherever they withdraw
6960881 not really we are not the ones who broke the ceasefire these groups of kato and bravo are no longer covered by the ceasefire
6960882 they did not follow the instructions of the milf leadership and therefore effectively they got out of the protection of the ceasefire agreement as far as we are concerned we do not consider them as covered by any ceasefire agreement if they withdraw to another area wherever that place is we will hit them that is the order to the military
6960883 armed conflict is the worst environment for human rights when insurgency groups attack villages they are violating human rights they cause bodily harm force civilians to flee their homes and their livelihood and deprive vulnerable sectors of decent living conditions work and education
6960884 cant get to sleep must get some sleep only have three more hours until i have to be up
6960885 multinational companies controlled from wherever are a big part of this nations economy and most other nations economies
6960886 i do not want the japanese coming in and buying up american technology
6960887 i do not want them in our state i dont want the arabs owning our banks or the japanese owning our means of production
6960888 foreign companies are looking at us and seeing a big market with low cost thanks to a weak dollar so it makes sense for them to put up a manufacturing facility here
6960889 but id rather see an american company building or modernizing a manufacturing facility here strengthening our country and our middle class
6960890 colorados whole orientation toward a new energy economy with high value jobs growth is farsighted and exactly the way we would want the state to be positioning itself
6960891 our manufacturing is eroding if theres an emergency or a war and we need to manufacture things quickly we dont have it wed like american companies to invest here rather than in mexico or malaysia
6960892 the spanish like to meet for longer meetings but the meetings were fascinating there was a lot to talk about
6960893 i would be very disappointed if we didnt end up with significant investment with at least three to five of the companies
6960894 those negotiations will take place over the next 12 to 14 months
6960895 colorado and canada benefit tremendously from a strong and growing trade partnership last year it totaled 4 6 billion
6960896 indeed canada is colorados largest export market and 124 000 colorado jobs are dependent on trade with canada
6960897 i find it interesting that people get upset about foreign investment
6960898 if we look at our growth of population our unemployment rate at 5 2 percent we need investment to keep things going if money is not available locally whats wrong with foreign investment
6960899 anyone who drives one had better be prepared to answer a lot of questions because when you pull up in one people will stop you and say wow
6960900 today is the first anniversary of our becoming a family
6960901 she loves to snuggle in the evening which melts my heart
6960902 well its been a little while hannah has a sister linnea kai both are wonderful smart and loving
6960903 were much more simple this time than we have been in the past
6960904 basically sen mccain and his staff feel that to do something real glitzy and las vegas like would be inappropriate the way the economy is
6960905 for these productions a huge amount over 10 million is spent on the lighting the rigging the sound
6960906 they get big time broadway and other producers hired as consultants to put on a show this is the biggest tv ad for the presidential candidate and the party
6960907 you just have to light up that small stage area
6960908 if youre watching from home youll really get the feeling of being on the floor
6960909 the convention is all about the american families that are going to be watching at home
6960910 you cannot do a political convention without confetti and balloons
6960911 i dont know if its 100 000 or 125 000
6960912 weve had a live orchestra in the past but this is going to be all electronic
6960913 theyre the newest and most modern and the pictures on there will be fantastic
6960914 we try to keep the pace of the show like a regular television show
6960915 im a theatrical producer by trade and we try to keep a tight time schedule because it makes it better for the networks and all the others covering it
6960916 were trying to create a good environment and make it look good so the candidate in this case sen mccain can deliver his message and have it come across in an appealing way
6960917 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6960918 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6960919 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6960920 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6960921 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6960922 we can play were where were at because we can play
6960923 i dont think we feel like that in new york we had chances to win every game same thing in boston
6960924 we could have won all those games with a couple of hits here and there
6960925 it seems as if her life was very stable and she was a productive law abiding citizen
6960926 unfortunately this case as horrific as it is is not unique
6960927 we have had cases in the past where parents have killed or have attempted to kill their children but each case is horrific in its own way and an immeasurable tragedy
6960928 one school of thought is institutional investors are more sophisticated than retail investors so its not surprising that these settlements dont extend to institutional investors just yet
6960929 the defendants broker dealers are agreeing to participate in a process with investors where they dont challenge liability
6960930 institutional investors may try to use that in proving liability in court
6960931 we are aware of the settlements in principle between several wall street banks and various regulators
6960932 if there is a responsibility to holders of those types of investments why is there not a responsibility to the holders of these types of investments
6960933 although the underlying cases are a bit different the city of st paul intends to vigorously prosecute our civil claims against merrill lynch until we get the publics money back
6960934 the other cars are economical or practical or environmental but you wouldnt call them sexy
6960935 i figured if you could convert a corvette you could convert pretty much anything
6960936 it wasnt supposed to be a fancy super shiny car
6960937 how hard is it to bolt a motor i mean really
6960938 they always say two years itll be ready in two years he said
6960939 and then two years go by and they say two more years
6960940 basically we should have had electric cars 40 years ago
6960941 i figured i would get it done and have the pleasure of cruising by a gas station and maybe waving
6960942 its also clear that the theft of up to 110 gigalitres of water in victoria by piping it into melbourne is an enormous disservice if not insult to the people of south australia in particular
6960943 that is not without significant risk its also important to be focused on water supply to communities along the way and tourism
6960944 hes a big horse and we thought let him find his feet a bit early and hit the line full of running and he enjoyed the solid tempo
6960945 he took a bit of catching but this bloke finished really well
6960946 youve never seen a horse eat like him in your life
6960947 the whittenbury family have been with us for a lot of years which makes it even better
6960948 heck im going to miss all of this if i move out
6960949 the alleged leader of one of colombias most powerful drug cartels has been extradited to the us by brazil
6960950 juan carlos ramirez abadia was handed over to the us drug enforcement agency in the city of manaus and flown out of the country on a us government plane
6960951 mr ramirez abadia known as chupeta or lollypop was captured in brazil last year and sentenced to 30 years in jail
6960952 us prosecutors accuse him of smuggling more than 500 tons of cocaine into the us and of routinely killing his rivals
6960953 mr ramirez abadia is alleged to have been a key member of the norte del valle cartel which is accused of sending huge amounts of cocaine to the us and europe and laundering the proceeds in brazil
6960954 he is on record with us and he is known as a prolific letter writer
6960955 ramsey stated that his father was in vietnam during the same time as senator mccain and that the government takes care of senator mccain but not his father who suffers from agent orange
6960956 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
6960957 there are numerous substances which are deadly for humans to inhale there are just as many time periods for signs of illnesses to show by which time its to sic late
6960958 who expects to develop cancer 40 years after vietnam only those that knew the risk and side effects of agent orange youre out of time allahu akbar akeem ramsey el
6960959 my voice you shall hear in the morning o lord in the morning i will direct it to you and i will look up
6960960 how can some say there are too many children thats like saying there are too many flowers
6960961 how can some say there are too many children thats like saying there are too many flowers
6960962 food security in the philippines is projected to remain stable with food consumption of 20 percent of the population estimated to fall short of nutritional target from 2007 17
6960963 higher food prices in 2007 and 2008 are not expected to significantly change the countrys food security situation because high levels of money sent by filipino workers in the middle east to support their families back home are expected to support the growing cost of imports
6960964 the food security indicators estimated for the study countries paint a bleak picture of not only the current situation but also the intensifying of the problem over the next decade assuming no significant changes in trends in production and financial situation of countries
6960965 hey hey the chinese gymnast already broke the rules because she was too young so your whole arguement is bogus
6960966 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6960967 a fair use is a lawful use of a copyright

6960972 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6960973 dont be too proud to take lessons im not jack nicklaus relationshipson august 19 2008 at 1 48 pm
6960974 ya im different maybe im not a supermodel but just because im fat doesnt mean that i dont have qualities worth admiring
6960975 and the best way to understand an artist is to delve into his mind
6960976 you should read between the brush strokes each painting has a story to tell understand it
6960977 anyone can read a painting tell me what is the story
6960978 why does he have to take medicine is it because hes shy
6960979 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6960980 if you get those individuals that fit the federal requirements it creates the american dream like no other program ive ever witnessed
6960981 whether it happens now or next year it will be a dream come true for these families
6960982 a house in galveston for this price would either be really old or rundown or have something wrong with it
6960983 being able to have a new house thats a decent size for us is really nice
6960984 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
6960985 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go
6960986 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
6960987 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
6960988 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
6960989 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
6960990 and he said no that i had to stay to talk with their fbi representative
6960991 when the officer told me i couldnt leave i packed up my camera gear sat in my car and waited for cpl tom robison
6960992 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
6960993 de tels tremblements de terre peuvent tre meurtriers comme la prouv le de 1989 de loma prieta pr s de san francisco de magnitude 6 9 ou celui de 1994 northridge proche de los angeles de magnitude 6 7
6960994 i really felt the excitement in my heart it was pounding even before the curtain opened
6960995 he definitely brought the house down and delivered a true rock star performance
6960996 he is just so genuine and kind hearted the moment you have an encounter with curtis you cannot help but root for him
6960997 i think it showed on his face how blown away he was with all the people there for him
6960998 it put me completely at ease and allowed to pump out my chest and sing my lungs out
6960999 im extremely impressed he and producer marshall altman put together a fantastic collection of some of his best work
6961000 it was one of the best vocal performances ive heard from him
6961001 i think the band was fantastic and they really played well off each other
6961002 theres an energy between all of them that just feels good
6961003 the great thing about that cover was that the band nailed it thats a tough song vocally for singers like curtis and myself who have about the same range but he aced it
6961004 curtis style harkens back to a time in pop music when the pop star reigned supreme
6961005 with well crafted exciting songs to boot you have to love curty p
6961006 curtis has been looking forward to this moment for so long and it was really cool to see this show come together so perfectly
6961007 also it was really cool to have our parents there because they have been so supportive of him for his entire career
6961008 the most unique thing about curtis as a musician is his unbelievable passion when he lived at home in san diego our rooms were right next to each other and i remember hearing him singing and playing guitar until like 2 a m in the morning and this was on a school night
6961009 he never takes a day off and he never lets any obstacle slow him down and for this reason i have no doubt that he will make it big
6961010 luckily singapore lose ah then the chinese government will say hen hao di er you can get better okay whatever la he said it in chinese and my han yu pin yin not good haha but if singapore won maybe china wouldnt be so forgiving to our country for stealing their gold medal and they wont allow singaporeans to enter china for business
6961011 strength without control is tyranny and control without strength is impotance
6961012 you put your right foot in you put your right foot out
6961013 i do diet and exercise but this excess skin doesnt seem to go away
6961014 i had a lot of stretch marks hanging pouch and sagging breasts
6961015 he gave me and amazing body with beautiful curves and perky breasts i have recommended him to several of my girlfriends and they have also been very happy with him
6961016 the move will not go against the sufficiency philosophy economy if thais understand how it works malaysia for example is already doing it even though the majority of the population is religious those who oppose of the plan will need to be enlightened on how it works the idea needs to be put before a national referendum
6961017 i dont have information yet on this issue but i will check for you
6961018 he has tended his resignation to us within the past month
6961019 he is under contract until the end of october and has got other opportunities
6961020 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
6961021 the striking lack of these explains why poor people especially those in marginalized social groups like pastorates in africa women and children constitute the vast majority of disaster victims
6961022 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsc member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday we have been informed that the two day meeting of nsg was constructive and useful

6961025 were now getting up to 60 letters a month from teenagers wanting to know how to get bigger thats double the amount compared to 2007
6961026 beckham had the body that teenagers wanted athletic and slim
6961027 but then daniel craig emerged from the sea in casino royale in his pants and all that changed craig is a lot more muscular beefier and that is now the ideal look
6961028 the danger is that many teenagers either take too much of the shakes instead of a nutritious diet
6961029 they will not provide you with the essential vitamins and minerals you get from fresh fruit vegetables and starchy carbs
6961030 everyone is growing up far too quickly some 15 to 16 year old boys are working out like men is this good for them
6961031 i dont think it is it seems like they are losing some of their innocence boys should be boys running around the park with a football not straining themselves pumping iron in the local gym
6961032 i think they need to enjoy their youth and not succumb to this huge pressure to have perfect abs bulging biceps and a ripped torso they have enough to worry about with puberty education
6961033 i dont want to be obese i work out so when its hot i can take my top off with pride i like the admiring looks i get it makes me feel good
6961034 there is pressure on boys to look good now in the past everyone cared about what girls looked like how fat or thin they were but us boys also care

6961039 a thrilling election season is now upon us obama vs mccain one candidate has promised a presidency different from any other one that will take us forward to embrace the hope of the twenty first century the other candidate says he has no idea how to use a computer
6961040 do democrats still drink from a sippy cup and sleep with the light on
6961041 can i get into the electoral college with just a 2

6961046 its a great year to be an american and a voter
6961047 fans that have had their tickets for 40 to 50 years are being asked to pay up to 20 000 per seat for the right to remain as a season ticket holder some of those same fans are also asked to pay up to 700 per ticket per game for tickets to the game
6961048 for a family of four that sits on the 45 yard line that is middle class the only luxury item in their lives is that they have giants season tickets
6961049 the previous 12 nfl teams which implemented psls have averaged 75 million in revenue from the sale of their psls the giants and jets will be raising a combined 740 million or close to 10 times the average of any other stadium that has used psls
6961050 it does not seem fair to me to burden your most loyal fans with psls of this value
6961051 they are selling their psls for substantially below market value
6961052 true and loyal fans do not look on their season tickets as an investment
6961053 ive had my jets tickets for 15 years i have three young sons that are all jets fans true fans will not be selling their season tickets and therefore will not see any return on their so called investment
6961054 you know stop lights dont come any redder than the one you just went through

6961129 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues or of being called up arent allowed to come i think thatd be great but thats a decision major league baseball would have to make and now that we have the world baseball classic i dont see that
6961130 theres room for improvement which is good i was definitely hoping that id be able to pull off a medal but youve got to have something to reach for and i finished strong got to be happy with that
6961131 when its this hot its almost like youre moving in slow motion

6961144 weve had nights like this where weve come in here and im explaining why we lost or how we lost we found a way to turn it around and have a good win
6961145 i was able to hit the zone with all my pitches but the sinker was most effective for me
6961146 why i have the strong desire to stand atop an iceberg instead of say the eiffel tower
6961147 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6961148 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6961149 taking some time off isnt always the easiest thing to do but i feel like im able to do it ok and not lose my swing by taking days off
6961150 one thing i talked about before the game is we cant do two things walk people and commit errors because of their propensity to hit home runs
6961151 we got away with it tonight but you cant expect to do that all the time we were fortunate
6961152 in the second or third inning i told the guys tonight was the epitome of being effectively wild

6961159 thats the situation were in right now we need to find ways to win its good for him to be back to be healthy and hopefully he pitches well for us
6961160 the key to the whole game was we didnt get abreu out at all
6961161 he wont chase bad pitches thats probably why he is as good of a hitter as he is
6961162 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
6961163 it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring
6961164 see thats a woman who is secure with her man this is a good woman shes a keeper

6961255 the results of the survey demonstrate that women understand the importance of a healthy smile but worryingly they are not prepared to spend the time and money looking after their teeth fear of the dentist is an age old problem 24 are not willing to undergo corrective treatment based on fear but new treatments such as invisalign which is a non invasive procedure using a series of clear plastic aligners to straighten your teeth have been popular as they are discreet and because they are removable patients can brush and floss as normal invisalign gives me the chance to straighten teeth but without many of the treatment barriers that cause my patients to shy away from with traditional metal dental braces the cost for treatment is a lifetime investment so when you compare this to how much women spend on beauty treatments it is minimal

6961335 netgear has always believed in customers satisfaction we launched the toll free technical support helpline 1800 425 4327 number two years back and further to make customer satisfaction paramount we are announcing the customer service centres as it is an international trend we have rt outsourcing to act as third party service provider for netgear in india
6961336 rt is an iso 9001 certified technical support organization rt with its unique business model has been providing integrated level 1 to level 4 services including tech support helpdesk repair and refurbishment services project implementation rma management and logistics services for the past 13 years with its tradition of excellence and commitment to customer satisfaction rt is a unique one point support organization for various activities to include return to bench repairs on site service support product installation and commissioning etc
6961337 by virtue of the fact that netgear holds the number 1 position 30 market share in smb wireless business and no 3 in wired business as documented by idc customer satisfaction is very critical for us in order to achieve optimum customers satisfaction we are investing towards service infrastructure and netgear as a company will put in all the investments needed for customer delight in reality netgear intends to redefine the levels of service and customers satisfaction in networking business
6961338 by opening the service centres we have enabled our distributors and channel partners to focus more on the business in the markets where we begin centres they need not have to worry about support any more on the other hand the service centres would certainly enhance the confidence of the customers on netgear products though we have emerged as a strong brand among the sme networking market space

6961368 thats the bet our founding fathers were making all of those years that our individual destinies could be tied together in the common destiny of democracy that government depends not just on the consent of the governed but on the service of citizens
6961369 thats what history calls us to do because loving your country shouldnt just mean watching fireworks on the fourth of july loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it
6961370 i am fortunate to have this exhibition given the fact that i took up photography not too long ago what is unfortunate about myself is that i have contracted motor neuron disease or lou gehrig disease a rare genetic form of illness that is terminal i was diagnosed at the age of 29 in november 2007 and you can imagine the shock and the difficulties of trying to adjust to my illness the purpose of this photo exhibition is to show you my turmoil through my camera lens and viewfinder the subject matters of my photographs encompass a wide variety of things that i have come into contact with after my diagnosis a bicycle a baby and amazing sunsets all the images were taken after i fell ill and they document my progression from the time i was physically fit to present when i can no longer hold a camera my story is not a sad one because i have not lost hope the message i want to convey through this exhibition is never give up dont stop dreaming and pursuing the things you desire in your life
6961371 when i first met alan chui he was quite persistent in wanting to learn everything about photography over the years ive had so many young people asking me to teach them photography but most lose interest and get bored eventually one of the first things i noticed about alan was his burning desire to learn how to take good images i could see that he had a genuine passion and desire to learn about photography and i could see that he set his mind to pursue this medium in just a few short years this young man has shown his photographic talents by thinking before shooting in order to get the images that he wants through his many long hours doing wedding photography and perfecting his skills at digital re touching he has become a sought after wedding photographer in hong kong in a very short time due to his passion for photography he has now branched out to encompass other forms of photography including documentary photography this exhibit represents his tenacity and passion for his true love of photography this is alan first photo exhibit depicting his amazing ability to take great images and not letting his illness prevent him from his desire to be a great photographer
6961372 erm no not yet a few more hours i think
6961373 so mac there i was in mummys tummy still kicking and pushing
6961374 thats what babys do isnt it before they get out of your tummy
6961375 i want drugs for the last hour there is no gas and air option here i hear some woman in another room screaming in pain poor cow
6961376 lady do you have any idea how many kids we have in here every day buying games do you think we have the time to look at each and every purchase
6961377 any failure rate is problematic but the failure rate were seeing is downright pathetic
6961378 similar to age restrictions on alcohol tobacco pornography and other products that are potentially harmful to children parents deserve a reasonable expectation that age restrictions for adult entertainment products will be enforced at the retail level
6961379 it is outrageous that retailers are not exercising greater responsibility and even more absurd that there are no meaningful consequences for those retailers who ignore their industrys own age restriction policies
6961380 countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual violent and profanity laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children
6961381 it is high time for retailers to follow the video game industry guidelines and check ids so that children will not be able to purchase m rated video games
6961382 perhaps the retailers felt the pressure was off after the ftcs report was published but frankly either rate of failure is wholly unacceptable
6961383 we encourage concerned citizens to contact their congressional representatives to ensure that the video game industry will become more responsible
6961384 americas children need to be protected from harmful exposure to these products and parents should be able to rely on the industrys promises
6961385 it has been our pleasure to serve the reynoldsburg community for the past five years
6961386 the new location better positions us for greater opportunities for ministry

6961395 the purpose of the blog is to have real conversations with the curriculums end users the teachers
6961396 my posts arent earth shattering they are based on the lesson in the study materials for that week im not re teaching the lesson but sharing personal stories of what god has been teaching me that relates to that weeks lesson
6961397 coming from the outside lifeway world i know what it is like to have no personal connection with lifeway
6961398 on the blog i hope i come across as being authentic while building credibility by putting myself out there
6961399 we used a few short term bible studies first from threads then migrated to lifematters
6961400 i visit the threads website often just for information and articles about teaching young adults and i just accidentally found this particular blog now that ive found it i rely on it each week
6961401 it makes me feel better to have another piece of material to pull from another example or illustration to talk about
6961402 sometimes i read the whole blog word for word to the class other times i just paraphrase or work it into my normal teaching
6961403 i e mail my class about twice a week with tidbits of information about the lesson or just life and i frequently use the blog material or parts of it in my e mail i like that its real life stuff that these young people can relate to even me at 40 something years old
6961404 this is the third quarter we are using the material and our study sessions have become ripe with meaningful discussions and connecting gods word to our young adults everyday lives
6961405 i check it out weekly to see what insights have been added regarding that weeks bible study
6961406 it gives some unique insight as i prepare for each weeks bible study the comments oftentimes clarify what it is god really wants us to get out of the material for that week
6961407 i like most the interaction between other users of lifematters and the editor who posts on the blog
6961408 it is great to see how god is working with people involved in the study and how that interacts with the people who designed and wrote the material
6961409 all things to all people so i may by all means save some
6961410 dont believe her i watch her every day she doesnt live like she is telling you
6961411 first and foremost the blog helps explain the very complex set of products services and events that make up the lifeway worship project
6961412 second it aggregates worship talk on the web pointing people to posts on other blogs and news sites regarding worship
6961413 the intent is to actively demonstrate that our section of lifeway isnt only interested in making resources
6961414 were interested in the dialogue that is occurring about the practice and theology of worship in the 21st century
6961415 the benefit of the blog is keeping the church informed about trends and preserving the integrity of worship in a changing world
6961416 the result is an informed group of worship leadership that can take new ideas and apply them to their congregations to equip their worshippers and ultimately grow the kingdom of god
6961417 we give tips on how to improve your marriage offer movie reviews provide updates on lifeways marriage events information on marriage resources to use in small group settings as well as experiential thoughts and research
6961418 i think people gravitate toward this type of interaction because its a different form of interaction its real and authentic
6961419 sharing what god is revealing to you about himself and discussing cultural insights into things that are happening currently in the world around you is something everyone can participate in
6961420 are you telling me i cant build my burger king because a delhi sands flower loving fly that has never been seen and is above ground only a few days a year might be near by
6961421 i cant build a connector road because the noise from construction might damage the hearing of the stephens kangaroo rat thus impairing its reproduction
6961422 all construction in san diego involving impacts to road ruts which might contain vernal pool fairy shrimp is enjoined all construction
6961423 we can and will go to court to enforce the law
6961424 well this one is by design discovery was one of the sections i wanted to work on this year and im really proud of how its turned out i wanted discovery to be the place that people go to discover new talent at our festival where we show what we consider to be some of the most exciting new voices in cinema from all over the world to do that i took off some of the restrictions we had on the program in the past in terms of the premiere status and distribution status we had quite a number of limitations on what was eligible for our discovery section in the past thats changed and as a result i think this is really just a great showcase for new talent in the movies

6961438 i thought it was a good game in some spots and in others where we need to pick up and do some work
6961439 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than last week
6961440 you have to have a mentality that every time you have a shot to return it
6961441 my blockers i just trusted them so i could get going i took advantage of my opportunity
6961442 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of outkicked his coverage i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight

6961456 i dont see it as a problem we want to play our best players alex has a lot of ability and a lot of potential and hes going to be a good quarterback in this league hes just not there at this point
6961457 this has not been a case of shaun and alex not performing well

6961460 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
6961461 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
6961462 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary
6961463 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees

6961467 daripada abu hurairah r a berkata rasulullah saw bersabda puasa adalah perisai memelihara daripada akhlak yang buruk apabila seseorang itu berpuasa maka janganlah dia mengeluarkan kata kata yang tidak elok mencarut atau kesat jika ada orang memakinya atau mahu membunuhnya maka katakanlah kepadanya sesungguhnya aku berpuasa sesungguhnya aku berpuasa
6961468 wahai orang orang beriman diwajibkan ke atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan ke atas orang orang yang terdahulul daripada kamu supaya kamu bertakwa

6961470 barangsiapa yang membaca al quran lalu dizahirkan dalam kehidupannya menghalalkan apa yang dihalalkan oleh al quran dan mengharamkan apa yang diharamkan oleh al quran maka allah akan memasukkanya ke dalam syurga dan dia dapat memberikan syafaat kepada sepuluh orang daripada ahli keluarganya yang sepatutnya dimasukkan ke dalam api neraka

6961526 aqu se han acogido varias de las propuestas que hicimos en las comisiones de hacienda y de agricultura del senado y por lo tanto la se al potente es que aqu hay nimo y disposici n para ir aplicando medidas
6961527 eso es lo que importa porque aqu durante mucho tiempo se dec a que no hab a mucho espacio y aqu se demuestra que cuando hay voluntad pol tica las cosas se hacen
6961528 creo que van en el camino en la l nea correcta y sobre todo y as se lo dije al ministro aqu se abre una puerta para poder seguir enfrentando este tema
6961529 en la situaci n en que estamos siempre ha sido nuestra postura y nuestra disposici n a colaborar a hacer propuestas y ver cu les son las soluciones factibles y me alegra que se est n acogiendo esas cosas porque eso implica que vamos solucionando los problemas de la gente

6961597 el uso de la lengua se lleva a cabo en forma de enunciados orales y escritos concretos y singulares que pertenecen a los participantes de una o otra esfera de la praxis humana estos enunciados reflejan las condiciones espec ficas y el objeto de cada una de las esferas no s lo por su contenido tem tico y por su estilo verbal o sea por la selecci n de los recursos l xicos fraseol gicos y gramaticales de la lengua sino ante todo por su composici n o estructuraci n
6961598 pierden su relaci n inmediata con la realidad y con los enunciados reales de otros por ejemplo las r plicas de un di logo cotidiano o las cartas dentro de una novela conservando su forma y su importancia cotidiana tan s lo como partes del contenido de la novela participan de la realidad tan s lo a trav s de la totalidad de la novela es decir como acontecimiento art stico y no como suceso de la vida cotidiana
6961599 en la gran mayor a de los g neros discursivos salvo los literarios un estilo individual no forma parte de la intenci n del enunciado no es su finalidad nica sino que resulta ser por decirlo as un epifen meno del enunciado un producto complementario de ste
6961600 en efecto el oyente al percibir y comprender el significado ling stico del discurso simult neamente toma con respecto a ste una activa postura de respuesta est o no est de acuerdo con el discurso total o parcialmente lo completa lo aplica se prepara para una acci n etc y la postura de respuesta del oyente est en formaci n a lo largo de todo el proceso de audici n y comprensi n desde el principio a veces a partir de las primeras palabras del hablante
6961601 todo enunciado um elo em uma cadeia complexamente organizada de outros enunciados
6961602 todo enunciado desde una breve r plica del di logo cotidiano hasta una novela grande o un tratado cient fico posee por decirlo as un principio absoluto y un final absoluto antes del comienzo est n los enunciados de otros despu s del final est n los enunciados respuestas de otros o siquiera una comprensi n silenciosa y activa del otro finalmente una acci n respuesta basada en tal tipo de comprensi n un hablante termina su enunciado para ceder la palabra si otro o para dar lugar a su comprensi n activa como respuesta el enunciado no es una unidad convencional sino real delimitada con precisi n por el cambio de los sujetos discursivos y que termina con el hecho de ceder la palabra al otro una especie de un dixi silencioso que se percibe por los oyentes como se al de que el hablante haya concluido
6961603 la oraci n no se relaciona inmediatamente y por s misma con el contexto de la realidad extraverbal situaci n ambiente prehistoria y con los enunciados de otros ambientes sino que se vincula a ellos a trav s de todo el contexto verbal que la rodea es decir a trav s del enunciado en su totalidad si el enunciado no est rodeado por el contexto discursivo de un mismo hablante entonces se enfrenta de una manera directa e inmediata a la realidad al contexto extraverbal del discurso y a otros enunciados ajenos las pausas que se dan entre los enunciados no tienen un car cter gramatical sino real una oraci n dentro del contexto verbal carece de capacidad para determinar una respuesta y la puede adquirir o m s bien se cubre por ella tan s lo dentro de la totalidad del enunciado
6961604 est orientada para a resposta de outro de outros para sua resposta compreensiva
6961605 ao mesmo tempo como na r plica de um di logo uma obra est separada de outras pelas fronteiras absolutas no revezamento entre sujeitos discursivos
6961606 objetivamente el objeto es inagotable pero cuando se convierte en el tema de un enunciado por ejemplo de un trabajo cient fico adquiere un car cter relativamente concluido en determinadas condiciones en un determinado enfoque del problema en un material dado en los prop sitos que busca lograr el autor es decir dentro de los l mites de la intenci n del autor de este modo nos topamos inevitablemente con el segundo factor relacionado indisolublemente con el primero
6961607 si no existieran los g neros discursivos y si no los domin ramos si tuvi ramos que irlos creando cada vez dentro del proceso discursivo libremente y por primera vez cada enunciado la comunicaci n discursiva habr a sido casi imposible

6961609 atitude subjetiva e avaliadora desde o ponto de vista emocional do falante com respeito ao conte do sem ntico de seu pr prio enunciado
6961610 una valoraci n real puede ser reali zada s lo por el hablante en un enunciado concreto las palabras son de nadie y por s mismas no eval an nada pero pueden servir a cualquier hablante y para diferentes e incluso contrarias valoraciones de los hablantes
6961611 palabra neutra de la lengua que no pertenece a nadie como palabra ajena llena de ecos de los enunciados de otros que pertenece a otras personas y finalmente como mi palabra porque puesto que yo la uso en una situaci n determinada y con una intenci n discursiva determinada la palabra est compenetrada de mi expresividad
6961612 una visi n del mundo una tendencia un punto de vista una opini n siempre poseen una expresi n verbal todos ellos representan discurso ajeno en su forma personal o impersonal y ste no puede dejar de reflejarse en el enunciado
6961613 el car cter dirigido del enunciado es su rasgo constitutivo sin el cual no existe ni puede existir el enunciado

6961620 have your emergency kit ready and know what your evacuation plan is
6961621 it looks like if the court wanted to do anything it would err on the side of disclosure
6961622 its just absurd for him to think that any of us would prevent him from having the right to dissent in a case where the courts issued an opinion
6961623 ive done it in several cases and other justices have too
6961624 i think it is unprecedented for a majority to quiet the vote of a justice because they dont like what he is saying on a dissent a justice has a constitutional right to explain his vote they are all equal and they cant muzzle a justice for that
6961625 the obvious result is that a wrongful death action may expire before the decedent does this judicially created rule is without foundation and frankly absurd

6961678 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6961679 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6961680 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6961681 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6961682 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6961683 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6961684 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6961685 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6961686 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6961687 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6961688 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6961689 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence

6961921 it means we won the game today i guess if you play long enough youre bound to get some milestones more importantly we won we needed this game
6961922 yeah 2 501 thats what ill be thinking about tomorrow
6961923 we talked about how well johnson did and i said good luck with tomorrow
6961924 it was beautiful it was an amazing place and the people really made it more amazing
6961925 it is iconic it really helps define this community i think people have an affinity for that building where you took your kids and grandkids
6961926 moms get off the train every day and walk with their toddlers
6961927 i think the children would object to there not being a choo choo
6961928 harper performs such a comprehensive service to the overall community
6961929 i think people will recognize this as an opportunity to make a tremendous impact
6961930 i think harper provides opportunities that wouldnt exist for many people
6961931 it could be a traditional student who cant afford a four year institution an immigrant or someone in their 50s who needs to learn a new craft to earn a living
6961932 fortunately people in the community do understand what they have in their backyard
6961933 there were some tears after she found out she didnt become a finalist but she got over it quick
6961934 but after the contest started she got a call from wrlr and has been on air singing
6961935 we absolutely plan on bringing her back in the studio after wednesday and have her on as much as possible
6961936 so while one door may have shut for her it seems like another one opened
6961937 the districtwide improvement trend is extremely consistent and its overall magnitude is substantial
6961938 these increases are a powerful indicator of systematic school and curricular improvement
6961939 were a large school district so we dont see drastic dips and peaks that smaller school districts see
6961940 but to watch these numbers go up six years in a row thats really school improvement
6961941 preparing for the worst what communities need to know in the event of a community tragedy
6961942 i think the majority of individuals are in the process of recovery
6961943 people are relying on their own resiliency to help them move forward
6961944 in light of all the facts and circumstances this is a fair sentence
6961945 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
6961946 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
6961947 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary
6961948 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees
6961949 the case involves a taxpayer supported governmental body that is being forced to defend itself against unfounded allegations of both racial discrimination and deficient education of english language learners
6961950 assuming plaintiffs allegations to be true without requiring them to present evidence to support their arguments
6961951 using the legal process thats available to us and i think thats our responsibility to make sure that we use everything thats available
6961952 it isnt about music it isnt about becoming contemporary it isnt about cultural awareness it isnt about being cool hip or with it it isnt about misty eyed intimacy with god it isnt about theological accuracy about god but its about the formation of hearts in the presence of god its about the shaping of disciples who know him through being with him its about the transforming work the holy spirit achieves when pure worship occurs
6961953 i want to bring people together to work on creative projects
6961954 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6961955 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6961956 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6961957 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6961958 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6961959 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6961960 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6961961 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6961962 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6961963 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6961964 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6961965 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6961966 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6961967 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6961968 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6961969 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6961970 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet
6961971 making a global problem a local one people can see the specifics of how climate change affects their local economy and their local ecosystems

6961989 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
6961990 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
6961991 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them
6961992 when one of us tells the truth he makes it easier for all of us to open our hearts to our pain and that of others

6962012 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6962013 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6962014 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6962015 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6962016 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6962017 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real

6962022 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6962023 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6962024 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6962025 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6962026 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6962027 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6962028 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6962029 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6962030 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6962031 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6962032 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6962033 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis

6962039 strategic analysis of animal welfare legislation a guide for the perplexed
6962040 animal welfare and animal liberation need not be separate projects
6962041 in the case of factory farming welfare reforms can provide immediate relief of suffering while at the same time contributing toward economic strategies intended to drive these exploitive industries out of business
6962042 welfare reforms that offer substantial relief of suffering while also raising the costs of animal exploitation should be favored so long as no harms can be demonstrated
6962043 in recent years a hardline abolitionist position in which efforts to improve the well being of currently existing animals are condemned as welfarist impediments to the future liberation of animals has gained momentum within animal advocacy
6962044 at the same time some proponents of animal welfare legislation also have engaged in discursive practices that make productive debate difficult

6962051 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6962052 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6962053 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6962054 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6962055 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6962056 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6962057 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6962058 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6962059 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6962060 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6962061 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6962062 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6962063 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6962064 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6962065 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6962066 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6962067 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6962068 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6962069 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6962070 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6962071 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6962072 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6962073 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6962074 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6962075 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6962083 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6962084 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6962085 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6962086 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

6962088 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6962089 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6962090 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6962091 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6962092 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6962093 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6962094 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6962095 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6962096 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6962097 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6962098 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6962099 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6962100 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6962101 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6962102 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6962103 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6962104 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6962105 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6962106 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6962107 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6962108 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6962109 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6962110 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6962111 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6962112 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6962113 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6962114 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6962115 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6962116 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything

6962124 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6962125 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6962126 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6962127 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6962128 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6962129 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6962130 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6962131 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6962132 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6962133 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6962134 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6962135 during the height of the cold war in the late 50s vogel was the only point man
6962136 i think the board and management of google need a total overhaul
6962137 thanks to its own hard line policies and miscalculations and the determination of free people around the world beijing utterly failed to portray the happy picture of tibet it had planned for in the lead up to the olympics and during the games chinese authorities have espoused vitriol against the dalai lama and his supporters broken their pledges of media access and committed both petty and gross violations against internationally recognized human rights norms from blocking access to rock songs celebrating peace to shooting tibetan demonstrators dead
6962138 there is a real drama going on in tibet during these olympic games and it has little to do with the flying buddhist sprites of the opening ceremony or the operatically conveyed propaganda of the closing ceremony chinas leaders now should move beyond showmanship to statesmanship and engage the tibetan people in finding real solutions to the real problems in tibet
6962139 not only have the olympics failed to act as a catalyst for political liberalization in china but the regimes pre olympics security buildup looks set to enable the government to crack down as hard as ever on dissent after the games are over growing instability on various fronts has predisposed the hu leadership toward strengthening the police state apparatus that has been put together in the name of ensuring a trouble free olympics moreover cadres in the law and order establishment who include senior officials in the central political and legal commission as well as military police and judicial departments have gained immense clout not to mention much more funding since early this year
6962140 in one hotel which had no guests at the time about 20 soldiers took over upstairs rooms overlooking the street for the entire period they entered the hotel discreetly so few people knew they were there they were behind curtains or stood back from the window in some other way so as not to be visible from the street they were changed periodically by replacements they paid a small token fee for each room and were well behaved and friendly all were chinese my source believed that an order had been given for that 24 hour period that soldiers could shoot on sight anyone who was seen with a knife or other weapon
6962141 the source heard four or five gun shots while he was at home with family and friends he wanted to go out into the street to see what was going on but his family and friends advised against that because the situation was obviously dangerous and in addition strict restrictions had been imposed upon the movement of tibetans since a few days before the olympics began he along with his family and friends performed some prayers at home
6962142 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
6962143 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
6962144 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive
6962145 the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
6962146 now you can say this is a perfect marriage between these two art forms just as the marriage of princess wencheng and king songtsen gampo was a marriage between the chinese and tibetan peoples
6962147 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6962148 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6962149 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6962150 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6962151 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6962152 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6962153 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6962154 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6962155 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6962156 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6962157 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6962158 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6962159 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6962160 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6962161 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6962162 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6962163 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6962164 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6962165 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6962166 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6962167 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6962168 i cannot imagine persecuting a minority group which is already being persecuted
6962169 how do i help to actually form the shape of this me instead of it totally forming me
6962170 i told him he was welcome to use them whenever he liked with or without attribution
6962171 the most important part of our reform is to create an open clean and transparent environment we are determined to clean the house
6962172 there is so much criticism in this room that reflects how biased media are on china how little they know
6962173 people do not know much about tibet and you should ask people in beijing about tibet i have friends in tibet and their living standard has improved dramatically
6962174 it is better for you to know some things before you reach a conclusion
6962175 the media want to find something to write about but you cannot do it at a cost of sacrificing the people
6962176 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6962177 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6962178 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6962179 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6962180 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6962181 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6962182 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6962183 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6962184 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6962185 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6962186 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6962187 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6962188 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6962189 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6962190 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6962191 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6962192 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6962193 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6962194 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6962195 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6962196 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6962197 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6962198 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6962199 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6962200 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6962201 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6962202 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6962203 of course you have to pay to go up a church youre closer to god
6962204 how do we get to richmond to see the speed skating oval
6962205 the speed skating oval im pretty sure its in whistler
6962206 but in any case its still just a big hole in the ground
6962207 well there you go then you know more than i do but i still cant tell you where it is exactly because the address is not on the website and i never go to richmond
6962208 i was seen this good looking girl for about 6 weeks and then someone took my binoculars o ut of the truck there she was a midget stripper i met her at a party one night and she popped out of a cupcake

6962218 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6962219 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6962220 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6962221 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6962222 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6962223 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6962224 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6962225 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6962226 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6962227 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6962228 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6962229 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6962230 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6962231 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6962232 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6962233 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6962234 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6962235 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6962236 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6962237 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6962238 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary

6962241 the last three days of fighting has severely affected the town where people remained in doors

6962259 absolutely appraisers continue to get pressured to hit the numbers needed to push transactions to closing said bill garber government affairs director for the appraisal institute the countrys largest professional organization representing appraisers
6962260 that has not changed yet added garber even though recently signed federal housing legislation toughened appraisal standards and the federal reserves new truth in lending rules ban interference bribes or intimidation designed to influence appraisers valuations
6962261 could find themselves under pressure to inflate values on those properties to cut lenders losses crabtree said even though the federal legislation authorizing the refinancing program specifically prohibits interference
6962262 is really to find out will this guy play ball will he be cooperative when we need him
6962263 pre comp a property with a sales contract pending at a specific price
6962264 will all this start to get under control gregoire said
6962265 no 1 is the opportunity costs of borrowing you end up losing the tax deferred growth potential when you take the money out of your 401 k and the interest you pay back on the loan is unlikely to earn as much of a return as your 401 k investment
6962266 im seeing a lot of people touch their retirement accounts for down payment money
6962267 whats going on from a lending perspective is that lenders are requiring a much larger down payment than they did a year ago preferring 20 percent down accepting 10 percent down with mortgage insurance
6962268 there are some clear risks of using a 401 k as a funding source for a down payment on a house you have to assess those risks and weigh them against the particular economic opportunity you have to buy a home under normal circumstances i think borrowing from a 401 k to purchase a home is ill advised but because of whats going on in the real estate market special and exceptional opportunities do arise
6962269 job security is important absolutely what is your contingency plan in the event you become unemployed how are you going to pay the taxes
6962270 i wanted to create the image of our embattled country to engrave it in music
6962271 a beautiful future time when the enemy will have been defeated
6962272 analogies are the most dangerous form of reasoning they connect resemblances but disguise facts
6962273 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
6962274 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6962275 as soon as we get him in custody theyre going to breathe a little easier
6962276 it tells me hes brazen and hes going to make a mistake

6962282 say farewell to all of your mistakes forgive yourself its a brand new day
6962283 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6962284 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6962285 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6962286 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6962287 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6962288 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6962289 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6962290 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6962291 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6962292 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6962293 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6962294 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6962295 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6962296 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6962297 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6962298 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6962299 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6962300 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6962301 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6962302 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6962303 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6962304 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6962305 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6962306 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6962307 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6962308 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6962309 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6962310 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6962311 we must help georgia rebuild that which has been destroyed that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
6962312 tim and evan arent in the mix i dont know anything about that
6962313 it appears the plane went down and it didnt go like straight down it appears in the photos that the plane slid along the surface of the ground and its pretty rough out there there are some gullies it then caught on fire and came to rest
6962314 it was engulfed in fire so much that we have no way to identify anyone just yet

6962321 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6962322 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6962323 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6962324 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6962325 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6962326 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6962327 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6962328 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6962329 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6962330 and he said no that i had to stay to talk with their fbi representative
6962331 when the officer told me i couldnt leave i packed up my camera gear sat in my car and waited for cpl tom robison

6962340 j t will be our starter going into the season
6962341 hes got very good command of the offense and played well in all three preseason games but now its time to get ready for the season
6962342 the perception will be wrong if that is the perception
6962343 because i think he is getting better and better right now
6962344 i dont see it as a problem we want to play our best players alex has a lot of ability and a lot of potential and hes going to be a good quarterback in this league hes just not there at this point
6962345 this has not been a case of shaun and alex not performing well
6962346 this has been a case of j t performing well
6962347 in fairness to john and jed scot and i kept them apprised
6962348 we believe that bringing the gigante stores into the el super family will provide synergies that will benefit both the company and the consumers in southern california
6962349 everything is built around latino strategies for survival and food preferences and these stores are fulfilling that
6962350 when youre buying for a family of five or six a major expenditure of the week goes there so a place that feels familiar is clean and has good bargains it just works for them
6962351 id be worried about the relevance of vons and albertsons
6962352 its a latino store for latinos thats why it works
6962353 ive always liked this place great prices and i like the fresh bakery
6962354 for strategic financial reasons we chose to sell these stores
6962355 were not as big as we used to be so were trying to promote in mexico with partnerships like the one we have with radio shack
6962356 they underestimated the other independent retailers that were here already and the relationships they have with the community

6962383 we want to make a good decision and we will
6962384 im confident ill say it again i like all three of them i thought tonight all three of them did a nice job

6962386 tonight our tempo stunk i didnt make any plays so i take that squarely on my shoulders a lot of times a quarterback if hes making plays can get the offense going and i didnt make any plays
6962387 its our job as an offense to go out there and score touchdowns
6962388 tonight we moved the ball consistently and we want to keep putting the ball into the end zone
6962389 i missed two big opportunities the long ball to josh and the ball to jason in the back of the end zone
6962390 those two stick out other than that i thought i played pretty decent but when you miss two big chances like that you cant get it out of your head
6962391 the productivity wasnt there for the offense so i cant sit up here and say the quarterback played well

6962492 but coming into the semi final i was hungry to get into the final and again my first dive wasnt so good but i slowly and surely made my way back

6962495 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6962496 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
6962497 normally it is my best dive i took over had a great start and i guess i just panicked in the middle of it kicked my feet too high and over rotated

6962664 weve got to make sure one thing that i think it is very important for us to do on all these issues is to lead by example thats why i think its so important for us to have religious tolerance here in the united states thats why its so important for us when we are criticizing other countries about rule of law to make sure that were abiding by rule of law and habeas corpus and were not engaging in torture because that gives us more or less a standard to talk about these issues

6962710 even by 1960 observers such as jane jacobs and jean gottman had discerned a new structure for metropolitan areas although popular interpreters of their work have neglected this insight this new structure was called the polycentric city in recognition of the multiple centers of economic activity that now comprised the metropolitan area while some people have recognized this change for more than forty years it still has surprisingly little impact on the design of public policy local governments and private individuals devote great resources to reverse the exodus of businesses from the downtown some of this activity is appropriate but much of it has an impact resembling that of king canutes orders to the tide
6962711 the sacramento county water agency is urging all customers to immediately cut water consumption 10 percent due to a reduction in surface water supplies from the american river
6962712 if customers dont achieve the 10 percent request the agency could call for stricter measures such as limiting landscape watering to designated days
6962713 the agency normally gets about 10 percent of its supply from the river via folsom lake
6962714 the u s bureau of reclamation recently notified the agency however that this supply will be reduced 25 percent due to the drought
6962715 because the agency had already consumed much of its allocation due to high customer demand the result is a total halt in river deliveries

6962748 students with high levels of involuntary subordination were more likely to experience recurring episodes of major depression even after controlling for lifetime history of major depression and current depressive status
6962749 an evolutionary theory of depression in which people feel there is no escape from negative circumstances or feelings and adapt by withdrawing in order to avoid further emotional harm
6962750 it was crucial to show that involuntary subordination was itself causing depression and not vice versa
6962751 bizarrely i want to take the boys to a third world country to make them appreciate what they have id like them to see how lucky they are to have so much compared to some im so desperate to see them but i know i wont be able to stop the tears flowing and they are both sensitive little boys and it will only distress them

6962757 section 377 of the ipc indian penal code which criminalises men who have sex with men must go i want to do away with it to curb the spread of hiv aids

6962762 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art
6962763 some time ago i was speaking to a billionaire from italy who found an indian artist featured in one of the catalogues of a global auction
6962764 he said indian art was so inexpensive if he had to purchase similar work by an american artist he would have to purchase it for 1 million whereas he would be able to buy similar quality art for 50 000 from an indian artist
6962765 the economy has changed anyone can buy indian art be it a sheikh from dubai or collector from hong kong one does not go to the west to validate it
6962766 those were the times when our country was battling several issues and there was no one to validate art but not any more
6962767 from the beginning avahan recognized that tackling these structural issues was more important than creating awareness alone
6962768 india has a population group of 2 3 million which fall in the category of males having sex with males msm
6962769 in order to intervene in this crucial segment access is needed and section 377 of the indian penal code that deems homosexual activity to be a crime makes this difficult if the section goes it will also help a great deal in de stigmatization
6962770 the exhibition is an attempt to humanize the epidemic and remind us that we all can play a role in reducing discrimination

6962820 campi was formed 13 years ago that is 1995 when i was a senator to respond to the challenge for the private sector to play a key role in the countrys motor vehicle development
6962821 i remember 1995 was also the year that wto started and that was the year that all those special protection programs of quantitative restrictions for the motor vehicle industry ended
6962822 so you were organized at a very important time for your industry and indeed you have been playing a key role
6962823 you were involved in crafting the new motor vehicle development program which focuses on the use of local parts for vehicle assembly and also on exportation and that is the way the automotive industry in the philippines can survive and flourish
6962824 you have also taken a strong stand for regional integration of the automotive industry given that you have shifted your focus to exportation and for the required international standardization including compliance with safety and the environment safer motoring as symbolized by your support for the safety belt law and cleaner motoring as symbolized by your support of the clean air act
6962825 you have come up with automotive units that not only comply with the clean air act but are also fuel efficient the automotive industry of the philippines produces hybrid models producing flexifuel engines that blend ethanol with gasoline fuel
6962826 we await the hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button

6962828 for one this is part of our green philippines program wherein we want an energy efficient nation free from reliance on costly and exhaust spewing cars as well as smokestacks renewable energy is a very big help in our green philippines program so that is why we are waiting for the hybrid to become bigger in our automotive industry
6962829 in general for renewable energy we can harness our sun wind and geothermal resources and produce our own clean fuels through biofuels and not rely on foreign suppliers
6962830 we need the will of the people and the support of campi to move our political leaders to embrace this new clean green philippines
6962831 i asked congressman jose antonio roxas of pasay to sit here in front because i want to thank him and through him congress for passing the renewable energy bill in the house of representatives
6962832 to help us in our call on the senate to pass this urgent legislation on the development and promotion of renewable energy sources we are confident that your voices will be heard
6962833 i have heard the term influential many times this morning and indeed campi is influential
6962834 we have not forgotten that you were among the supporters of the law rationalizing the excise tax on motor vehicles and that you were among the staunchest campaigners for the biofuels act
6962835 so i would like to thank you so much for your support
6962836 the search for cheaper and cleaner fuel has become a necessity not only because we want cleaner motoring but also in the light of the worsening global environment environment both in terms of the ecology and the economy and the increased pressure on economies that have little or no energy sources of their own
6962837 we do not want our local automotive industry to suffer from unfair competition posed by smuggled special utility vehicles especially
6962838 let us together sharpen our drive against corruption and smuggling
6962839 it will deepen our defense cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threat
6962840 the shield is not directed against anyone this is a defensive system
6962841 there will be no more signing of the moa ad even if the supreme court finds it constitutional the government will no longer sign the moa ad because we have seen its flaws we are also reviewing the situation because milf forces have done much terroristic damage and killed government military men and civilians in mindanao what is worse is that the milf central leadership with whom we are negotiating does not have the obedience of its commanders and fighters
6962842 t he dirty secret is that we couldnt deport 10 million illegal immigrants if we wanted to
6962843 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
6962844 we cannot find bidol in his house city and all of mindanao
6962845 im proud of you boys you can fight and win battles faster than our politicians could create them
6962846 kalayaan o kamatayan mga kapatid ang kalayaan ay inaagaw sa dulo ng patalim freedom or death brothers freedom is won through force of arms
6962847 and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
6962848 this agreement which put syrian lebanese relations back on track is an important historical step
6962849 every syrian administration has since 1932 regarded lebanon albeit quietly
6962850 the borders of the shebaa farms cannot be demarcated under the israeli occupation
6962851 reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian border
6962852 but we certainly know that the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6962853 mccain has worked hard to take his case to the people and draw this election into a real challenge and a real fight
6962854 if you look at the raw partisan numbers it might suggest that senator obama is not doing quite as well as you would think
6962855 obama presented thoughtful answers as if he was in a conversation or at a seminar
6962856 on the other hand you dont want a president who is hamlet who cant decide anything mccain spoke in bumper stickers
6962857 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to invent himself
6962858 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against right now
6962859 the scribes and the pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of moses therefore do and observe all things whatsoever they tell you but do not follow their example for they preach but they do not practice they tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on peoples shoulders but they will not lift a finger to move them all their works are performed to be seen they widen their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels they love places of honor at banquets seats of honor in synagogues greetings in marketplaces and the salutation rabbi as for you do not be called rabbi you have but one teacher and you are all brothers call no one on earth your father you have but one father in heaven do not be called master you have but one master the messiah the greatest among you must be your servant whoever exalts himself will be humbled but whoever humbles himself will be exalted
6962860 we were sure of the friendship of the mother and if she was with us it would be but a short time before the father who was no doubt a soldier in the insurgent army would come in and surrender and join his family
6962861 india would be engaging with anybody in power in pakistan
6962862 president musharraf has been a friend of the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism
6962863 russia hopes that the departure of pakistan president pervez musharraf will not have consequences for the internal political stability of the major asian nation
6962864 where the catholic vote could make a real difference are florida ohio and louisiana
6962865 sometimes the best thing to do is to say nothing just let her know youre there
6962866 enriching academe religion as an object of study and discourse in a secular university
6962867 balancing of conflicting interests towards synergy in the fulfillment of faith programs
6962868 i hope you will remember me as a dedicated bangkok governor someone who has shared the happiness and gloom of bangkok residents
6962869 the golden triangle is closing a dramatic period of opium reduction a decade long process of drug control is clearly paying off
6962870 identifies an overall rising trend in the abuse of drugs
6962871 a target of zero drugs for production trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs in the region by 2015 is obviously unattainable
6962872 gt or lt when you actually publish they come out looking like gobbledygook
6962873 in total the profits were rm20 77bil the government must explain these figures and why such huge profits have been agreed at the expense of the rakyat any profit should be passed down to the people in the form of reduced tolls gobind said
6962874 however a week earlier the deputy minister told parliament that the ministry had made a decision that the agreements could be made public there is a very serious contradiction here he said
6962875 the minister should encourage transparency and forward me copies of the toll concession agreements the rakyat demands to know why they are paying high toll rates when the highway concessionaries are reaping billions in profits gobind said
6962876 instead of looking at ways to reduce the burden of the residents the government is only causing more hardship we ask for the agreements to see if there are ways the toll collection could be reduced this is a genuine call by the residents to help resolve a big problem gobind said
6962877 however we hope it would not come to that stage as the relevant parties could come together for the benefit of the residents he said
6962878 my toll expenses alone are more than rm600 since most of us are middle class earners the government should implement a one way toll collection or alternatively make toll payments more affordable said toh
6962879 i dont know how wed keep him off the field at this point
6962880 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
6962881 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6962882 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6962883 we must thank abe for enabling aso to have connections with the machimura faction without which aso could not hope to take the reins of government
6962884 i believe that the laptops were also bought for the previous batch of councillors where are the laptops now we dont mind using the old laptops
6962885 the council said the manufacturer didnt respond to their tender advertisement
6962886 i am sure that if a request is made the manufacturer will be more than happy to offer its services
6962887 where are the other four laptops who are using them the council staff do not need laptops since they have their own desktop computers
6962888 why do they spend so much in the laptops when the money can be used to upgrade the playgrounds maintain the drains and roads
6962889 my daughter was diagnosed with mild mental disturbances after she was involved in an accident two years ago
6962890 parents of such children should give them proper medication and if they do not know how to deal with them they should consult counselling centres
6962891 the suspect is now being investigated under section 376 of the penal code for rape
6962892 definitely it is going to happen and i am optimistic that it will happen in march
6962893 our model proves that low cost long haul can work if you do it right the faster we expand the faster our costs drop and the faster we can be more aggressive on pricing
6962894 i support the principle to help us increase the participation of women in the workforce because it is relatively low now at 46 compared to more than 70 in the developed nations
6962895 i just saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6962896 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix
6962897 i found the trains really packed some had waited for three trains and yet could not board
6962898 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside
6962899 the cabinet decided to bring forward the enforcement date for adjustment of the new petrol price
6962900 i heard the dogs barking the night before but i did not think much about it
6962901 its dangerous for the residents and there are old folks taking morning walks at about 5am when it is still dark someone may break a leg should they fall into the hole
6962902 even so drivers may not see them at night and drive into the holes i have difficulty sleeping at night worrying if any car would get into an accident due to the exposed manhole
6962903 maybe the delay was due to finding the right size of covers to cover the manhole
6962904 we are now discussing the possibility of using fibre covers instead of iron ones to prevent theft
6962905 they say mohd saiful was not paid a fixed salary and was merely a volunteer but later in an interview with
6962906 this is what that puzzles me most who would take a coffee making volunteer on a trip
6962907 so the burden from mohd saifuls oath will not only be carried by him but also by his entire generations
6962908 they say as a woman and a mother i was forced to give in to anwars demands
6962909 but anwar was the one who was victimised jailed and denied his right to stand for the general election
6962910 if mohd saiful claims that the sodomy allegation was so called personal between him and anwar why is it being blasted in this by election campaign
6962911 the reason i watched the debate was because i wanted a clearer picture of the situation it was also a chance to see our new and old leaders respond to each other
6962912 i dont think there is any result from the debate its just the same things i read in the newspapers nothing new
6962913 the gist of it is that the property owners should have the right to divide the land
6962914 you have to consider were the wildlife is going to go
6962915 if you put too many houses in were are they going to go
6962916 because we live out here doesnt mean we dont care
6962917 we do care actually we care more than the city folk because we live with it
6962918 there are so many rules now that i dont know what else you want to do
6962919 the only thing people can do to protect it more is simply for the government to buy all the land and protect it from human activity
6962920 people who want to do that cant afford to buy 100 and 50 acre plots
6962921 if people are out there and theyve got a quarter acre under cultivation than thats ridiculous
6962922 anybody whos participated in agriculture or livestock raising will know that its not just the tax write off
6962923 everybody had this one thought and nobody put it together and when it finally was out there for everybody to say and speak their piece they all were saying the same thing
6962924 its very hard to maintain these beautiful fields that people enjoy
6962925 i dont think the urban people realize whats involved we dont make laws for the urban people
6962926 the urban people should look at the rural peoples feelings
6962927 we are using up the land for houses and we need to stop
6962928 just because they like to look at our trees and property doesnt give them the right to tell us what to do with it
6962929 if the county wants us to keep our property as is they ought to allow us to continue activities without all the restrictions on our property
6962930 one may argue that if thaksin is innocent why did he run i would too if the law here can be enforced retrospectively to dissolve thai rak thai and disqualify its 111 members
6962931 but pervez musharraf may be indias best hope for peace with pakistan
6962932 there has been considerable interest in developing the natural gas resources contained in the marcellus shale interests that could yield a substantial economic boom for the commonwealth
6962933 dep has been working in cooperation with the susquehanna and delaware river basin commissions to create a consistent streamlined process for evaluating water usage and disposal in all areas of the state because this type of drilling requires significant amounts of water
6962934 this addendum to the permit application requiring a water management plan will reduce administrative delays for the drilling industry while helping us to determine what demands will be placed on our natural water resources
6962935 there is the potential for significant economic opportunity for the citizens of the commonwealth with the development of the marcellus shale formation but this resource must be extracted in a manner that is consistent with state and federal laws that protect our water resources
6962936 the drilling industry has been cooperative with this effort and dep regional staff has been trained on the new procedures so that permit applications can be reviewed and processed in a timely manner
6962937 being a new plant you are always going to have some problems associated with start up
6962938 id be very surprised if it is going to take more than another week
6962939 how can you fit 300 boats here without coming into conflict with those things that make it a unique place
6962940 we havent been able to manage the birds needs with the humans needs well
6962941 as a selectmen we want everybody to enjoy it but we dont want a few bad apples ruining it for the families out there
6962942 anything that causes a break in the communications chain between those requiring assistance at sea hm coastguard and the rescue resources in our case rnli lifeboats could potentially put lives at risk
6962943 felt the cruelty of sports competition and sighed for liu
6962944 zhu suffered too much pressure at that time who will go to smash the windows of liu xiangs home today
6962945 china is far away from the period when it has to prove its national strength with gold medals chinese will no longer return to the state of east asias sick men just because of the loss of a gold
6962946 you are not going to get rich by saving 10 percent of your income every month
6962947 be suspicious of stock stories the stock brokerage and information businesses work on the basis of drama
6962948 to get your financial fortune started you have to radically boost your income
6962949 everyones on a different level as far as how green they want to be
6962950 to not make it to labor day at buoy 10 is just incredible said trey carskadon of the northwest sportfishing industry association
6962951 the bottom line is we have more demand ability and interest to catch fish than fish to provide williams said
6962952 this is ludicrous i think people are entitled to a vote
6962953 we thought robert was a breath of fresh air and he represented blue collar families
6962954 as a councilmember i do what is best for the community at the time not what is best for a special interest group
6962955 i have a lot of respect for the teamsters and i believe in union issues
6962956 i hope it does go to a vote of the people
6962957 if the community feels we made the wrong decision i respect that i trust the people and i trust their judgement
6962958 this is another initiative that aerogal has undertaken as part of its commitment to our country and to sustainable tourism
6962959 this certification allows us to perform our environmental duties and to promote a proactive conservation attitude within our company it has also taught us to make sustainability a practical concept that improves the way the commercial airline affects the environment within a environmentally responsible framework
6962960 we are the first airline in the world to carry this green seal it is a further guarantee to our tourist customer who uses our services and who already knows our commitment to safety and reliability
6962961 i just cant forget what he did to me its rushing back to me these memories
6962962 i dont know why he did it i met the wrong person thats all
6962963 a lot of women get hit from their husband but i dont know why im really happy he went to jail for a long time he kept me away from all my family my family is happy hes gone away
6962964 it will take me a while to get better i want to move on and find another life i dont want to have another husband i just want to be myself
6962965 it is clear that you are a violent bully with no respect for women and no respect also i might add for orders of the courts
6962966 given sufficient time the non random survival of hereditary entities will generate complexity diversity beauty and an illusion of design so persuasive that it is almost impossible to distinguish from deliberate intelligent design
6962967 small talk is no small thing its a valuable personal and professional thread that connects people
6962968 i dont want to monopolize your time this evening can we arrange to meet later
6962969 several good friends have marked my map to help us out that help has been invaluable one of the many reasons to be part of the muskie community
6962970 there were lots of eagles and loons remind me why i came back oh yeah a paycheck
6962971 none of the states wanted to be the last one to approve the compact
6962972 i am so pleasantly shocked and surprised i still cant believe its actually happening
6962973 unreasoning awe or fear of something unknown mysterious or imaginary especially in connexion with religion an irrational religious belief or practice a tenet scruple habit etc founded on fear or ignorance
6962974 they are depriving those who drop out of school at form 3 a chance to earn a living
6962975 the mnlf is the official representative of the bangsamoro people in the organization of the islamic conference
6962976 being turned into walking dictionaries even as their intelligence is force fed the way geese are force fed their physical strength is being sapped their moral energy drained

6962978 hello my name is smith spelled j o n e s
6962979 weve looked at motive means and opportunity and have come up with a partial solution to the puzzle we must now put the last piece in place by probing who had the ability and the gall to cover up the dastardly crime in full view of the entire world
6962980 the temerity to kill the political oppositions most charismatic leader in the middle of an international airport in broad daylight and to telegraph veiled threats of these vile intentions weeks and months before pushed the limits of filipino sensibilities the plotters must have calculated that given some time to let off steam filipinos would soon file away the aquino assassination in some dark corner where they store unpleasant memories that can be promptly forgotten
6962981 disputed islands in the south china sea and south east asia
6962982 a law enacted by congress enjoys the strong presumption of constitutionality
6962983 to justify its nullification there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the constitution not a doubtful and equivocal one
6962984 the bir and boc commissioners and their respective officers should be vigorous in fully implementing the law instead of looking for loopholes to circumvent the penalties provided therein
6962985 the pressure in pakistan was mounting for him to step down as he was seen as standing in the way of any credible transition to democracy and today we saw him reading out his own epitaph on his misrule and lack of governance he tried to justify pretty much what he had done but i think at the end of the day this was the only option because the space for him to remain president had shrunk so much that it had become impossible to carry on
6962986 he damaged pakistan a lot he claimed that he put pakistan back on the map of the world but the fact is that pakistan during his time came to be known as an epicenter of international terrorism the general perception was that he was part of the problem not the solver of the problem
6962987 rampant corruption within the courts has badly tarnished the image and stature of the judiciary judges demanding bribes meeting ex parte i looked this up
6962988 even official accounts acknowledge that the corruption is becoming more serious and widespread the 1996 supreme peoples procuratorate work report stated 3 792 members of the judiciary were investigated for crimes a 40 percent increase over the previous year including 1 055 cases of illegal personal enrichment an increase of 100 percent over the previous year
6962989 unless the incumbent president is removed from office dies or resigns the incumbent shall serve until 2010 the year her constitutional term of office ends she is however not qualified to run again for office under the constitution
6962990 no retired military officer may be appointed permanently or temporarily to any civilian position in the government unless no civilian civil servant qualifies for it
6962991 it is only right that ninoy aquino be made a national hero
6962992 here on cards are several events in the philippines in the last 100 years please look at them one by one and say which in your opinion is the most important event is very important but not the most important is somewhat important or is not important
6962993 1986 the edsa people power revolution and restoration of democracy
6962994 the fact that we give increases when there isnt any money just compounds the budget problem
6962995 if we want to have a quality workforce we have to be competitive
6962996 i can tell you its getting harder and harder to recruit people to work for the city of long beach
6962997 there is maybe money from the bond and maybe theres not
6962998 sometime in the very near future the citizens of long beach have to decide what they want their city to look like and what theyre willing to pay for it
6962999 we need to restore faithfulness we need to bring back truthfulness we need to become friends again and heal our land this is the healing balm that our sick nation needs
6963000 if our nation is to be healed and if we truly want to live in true democracy
6963001 we must learn to live in the truth without the cloak of executive privilege if we truly wish to honor president cory we must demand from our government transparency and honesty we want for the philippines a true program of governance and not a game plan for the sake of those in power mindless of the plight of the poor
6963002 its become much harder to make money on the majors
6963003 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500million viewers
6963004 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6963005 you will be together whether you like it or not
6963006 there is no deal with the president and he had himself resigned
6963007 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters
6963008 you can see the beautiful village set here it also has three beautiful girls
6963009 the first thing cade said when he came in here was
6963010 z o liwa walka mi dzy p legalnymi jezuitami a masonami o kontrol nad prowincjonalnym uniwersytetem
6963011 on monday july 21 2008 the u s attorneys office of philadelphia charged mendte with one felony count of intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization as he continually logged into lanes yahoo mail and mac accounts not only from the station but from his computers at home and at the private union league of philadelphia with 537 log ins between january and may 29 2008 a conviction could bring a six month prison term under federal sentencing guidelines
6963012 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6963013 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6963014 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6963015 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6963016 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6963017 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6963018 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6963019 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6963020 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6963021 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6963022 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6963023 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6963024 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
6963025 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
6963026 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
6963027 congress hereby grants the right to bear arms to the people
6963028 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

6963041 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government

6963043 clearly reflect that the three deceased detainees required significant time to prepare the instruments with which they committed suicide
6963044 the possibility that the detainees used this uninterrupted gap in guard coverage to prepare these instruments cannot be ruled out
6963045 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions

6963067 we have a responsibility to educate our students about being responsible citizens
6963068 what we do need to have is more involvement in the hispanic community from a law enforcement standpoint
6963069 when we send an investigator out to talk to them were having to go two at a time because somebody has got to go with them that can translate if the language is a barrier
6963070 there is a large amount of distrust and ive had various law enforcement agencies ask us how can we build those bridges
6963071 for us it comes down to a capacity issue but maybe this is the domino that needs to fall to make some things change

6963082 what a fabulous job this commission has done a real service to this nation
6963083 the so called 9 11 commission has already been meeting in fact this is its eighth session the fact that former clinton and both former and current bush administration officials are testifying gives it a certain tension but
6963084 we were supposed to be independent not necessarily confrontational we were investigating a national catastrophe
6963085 the purpose of a government investigatory commission is to place blame where it does the least harm politically our aim has not been to assign individual blame
6963086 this was not something that had to happen there are people that if i was doing the job would certainly not be in the position they were in at that time because they failed they simply failed
6963087 physicist steven jones had already made this observation when he characterized the nist report as a

6963092 the danger of it is i dont want to mess with raul
6963093 he has been so good i dont want to toy with him too much but he is such a pro that wherever he hits he will give us his best effort and not let it get in his head
6963094 but when you lose seven games in a row and you put the same thing out there every day changing the lineup gives you a little different feel
6963095 were just trying to get a different feel to the lineup were not sitting down anyone were just moving them around
6963096 he knows that batting with raul batting behind him now they really have to pitch to him id like to do this against right and left handers well just have to see how it goes
6963097 he was concerned about rauls state of mind and didnt want to mess with him
6963098 i also have talked to raul about it and he doesnt care where he bats
6963099 its really not that much of a change for him when he hits ninth ichiro suzuki is hitting behind him and now it will be beltre
6963100 we were here four days and nights we couldnt sleep our whole building shook with the bombing
6963101 i just sat here with my 16 year old son
6963102 this is a turning point for muslims with regard to our participation in the political process
6963103 that really shook my faith in the leadership of this country not only the leadership in the white house but the leadership in the military
6963104 i wanted to be an example for other asian americans and other muslim americans involved in the process
6963105 i realized this was a great opportunity to show that muslims participate
6963106 we are an important and active part of the electorate in this country
6963107 our whole apartment is dedicated to this view everything revolves around that
6963108 i feel violated now if i go get some water from the fridge

6963113 for mr trump this acquisition was not business related but as he has stated was meant to help out an american icon
6963114 if another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit mr trump sought for ed mcmahon then he is clearly pleased
6963115 i promised him i would do the best i could to honor his memory and bring in the final crop
6963116 i feel i cant fulfill a promise i made to a man who died and i just feel horrible about that
6963117 from what i can get from my counsel he has no rights because there was no sublet clause in the lease

6963122 in the end permian as the levels of atmospheric oxygen fell and the levels of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide rose the upper levels of the oceans could have become rich in hydrogen sulfide catastrophically this would kill most of the oceanic plants and animals the hydrogen sulfide dispersing in the atmosphere would kill most terrestrial life
6963123 still here goes in 2008 i should have dispensed with the optimism stopped playing the inside the beltway pundit game of influence and talked straight
6963124 what im most surprised by is the absolute failure of my pessimism to be up to the task
6963125 i reject out of hand completely the idea that i should take into account cultural differences
6963126 this gentleman is not a predatory manipulative child sex abuser
6963127 as repugnant as it may be to us in some parts of the world no one turns an eye when someone is walking around with someone who looks like his daughter as a date
6963128 ive had this self centered streak that has caused me to be where i am
6963129 this offer reflects our commitment to rewarding employees for contributing to the companys success while addressing head on the challenges we face in managing long term costs so that we can continue providing great pay and benefits
6963130 there are a group of people up on the hill who have been pretty vociferous that the trees are removed
6963131 i do know there were some residents in the area who were concerned about the trees along the burke gilman but im not sure if it was there where the trees were damaged or elsewhere
6963132 we have no idea who would do it the vandalism but there are lot of people who would be unhappy with them the trees
6963133 we kind of rely on people to rat people out
6963134 thats sort of all we can do our crews are there from time to time but not every day
6963135 on behalf of our respective organizations we are pleased to have reached this settlement
6963136 after many months of tough negotiations we have committed to the first three year negotiated agreement on terms and conditions of employment including compensation between the parties in nearly 20 years

6963141 there wasnt anything spelled out to save it for posterity
6963142 as a matter of fact she just wanted to keep the house long enough to finish her use of it
6963143 a living trust can establish some privacy because theyre not public like a will
6963144 often time people dont even realize their will is public
6963145 she never had any problems telling you what was real and what was true
6963146 our lives are so hectic and i guess we make them that way but once we get to that age those things dont matter anymore
6963147 she wanted her picture taken and she was up on the ledge
6963148 her sandal got caught thats when i saw my mom trip over a rock and i saw my mom fall forward

6963150 australia is going backwards during the period of coalition government household net wealth tripled in 11 years now its not just not increasing its going backwards
6963151 i am genuinely concerned and i think australians are starting to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the election they are starting to go backwards in net terms
6963152 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6963153 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6963154 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6963155 when selling a product over the internet trust is a huge thing once you gain trust from someone they will pay for your product the next year even if its more expensive
6963156 people if theyre paying for it they feel like its better
6963157 people are leery of just downloading a free file or mailing their memory card off to someone who says its for free
6963158 theres a number of people out there who feel like im breaking the law

6963160 her parents were given certain representations about her care and it was on the very first day due to lack of staffing that her tracheal tube was never checked or cleared
6963161 well its not true they have a systemic history of deficiencies that have injured their residents and killed some people should not be misled especially when theyre in a vulnerable position
6963162 they are a very troubled corporation its just very sad that they are as bad as they are
6963163 they totally assured us that she would receive the care necessary for her condition
6963164 losing lee ann was a real blow to our family but even beyond that
6963165 lee ann was an advocate for anybody and she would always fight the good fight
6963166 we have just received the lawsuit and have not had sufficient time to carefully evaluate the complaint we have referred the lawsuit to our lawyers due to the breadth and complexity of the allegations and are awaiting their analysis this is a class action lawsuit which implies that all residents within the facility during the timeframe specified would have been equally impacted by any and all deficiencies the facilities received in any given survey there are approximately 189 requirements that each facility must meet these deficiencies are typically isolated to just a few residents and do not impact most residents in the facility
6963167 the complexities of the purported class action will require an analysis of the care provided to each member of the purported class in each facility during the three year period alleged this task will take a significant period of time to complete once the class has been certified by the court
6963168 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos

6963173 we did have some heavy rain recently and a lot of times that is what causes these things to happen

6963176 whatever your opinion its important to make sure your voice is heard
6963177 because they cant see or hear what we really want
6963178 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work
6963179 this action allows us to rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6963180 i dont think theres anybody who thought we were going to bring out two live talking patients
6963181 from the lowest ive ever been to now its just great
6963182 much fuss has been made about the official condemnation of communism there has been a lot of talk but little has been done the waters remain murky the scandal over the appointment of sorin antohi und andrei corbea hoi ie to give speeches at the icrs summer school in berlin offers further proof of the romanians difficulties in dealing with their more recent past was the icr unable to find representatives who would not provoke a wave of shocked protest among romanian german writers living abroad if so we have a problem there are no more morally and professionally irreproachable intellectuals left in romania and if this is the case we really need to seriously think about the reconstruction of the elites which were destroyed by communist re education
6963183 the georgia conflict has clearly shown that there is a lot of tension in central asia and that the position of the western countries is extremely weak there asia is in the process of becoming the powerhouse of the future and not only economically it is here that the solutions for terrorism and for the energy and climate issues must be found we do not need another conflict we cannot win we need intensive cooperation with russia and other actors in the region the eu countries must reach a fundamental decision about the borders of the eu even if this reignites the awkward debate about turkeys membership rather than taking on new members the eu should work out a concept for an eu light of which the countries of the east turkey and the north african states could be members
6963184 in the past few years chinas official policy has been focused on winning more medals than the us in beijing 2008 and it may well accomplish this because the americans have fallen too far behind in the past few days i have seen several analyses which draw the inevitable conclusion that the global balance of power has definitively shifted towards asia but all these analyses fail to take into account that all the european countries are competing as individual nations i counted them up and by my reckoning the european union has won a dizzying total of approximately 200 medals which is more or less the same as china the us and russia put together now that is a true show of power
6963185 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
6963186 financial stability is critical for this company and unfortunately a reduction in work force was necessary to achieve it
6963187 i am confident this action will set the company on the path to profitability so that we can continue to lead the very light jet category
6963188 i dont think theres anybody who thought we were going to bring out two live talking patients
6963189 there goes her old beat up car outside of our old favorite bar
6963190 about an imaginary friend who i met in mississippi but i havent been to mississippi
6963191 i think its obvious why somebody would do that that is too have them not there
6963192 this wasnt a random act of vandalism with somebody scrawling their name on the side of a tree there was pretty direct action here
6963193 yes i want to play in the nfl thats what ive always dreamt about doing i cant picture myself doing anything else i cant imagine working a real job
6963194 id rather play the game and get paid to do it
6963195 if for whatever reason it didnt work out i still would be very pleased to have come here ive had a great time
6963196 youve got to have a break youve got to have a team that needs your style of play and you have to go out and perform
6963197 i use it to excite myself and go out and work harder
6963198 hes a big enough kid there are a lot of good quarterbacks that just arent big enough
6963199 hes got the physical tools hes been productive hes smart and a good leader i think hes got the ability to be a very good backup in the nfl
6963200 i do think hell excel in the system we try and put together for him and i think he has the ability to perform at a high level
6963201 because were from such a small school nationally speaking and havent had anybody since kitna make it to the nfl this is fairly new grounds for central to have scouts coming through here like that
6963202 theres not too many people you can turn to and ask questions concerns its nice having a teammate to talk to about it somebody who knows what youre going through
6963203 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6963204 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6963205 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract
6963206 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6963207 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6963208 i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6963209 if the ancient greek general and historian thucydides lifted his head now he would perhaps be unable to comprehend the european union in which pacifism has suppressed violence but he knew precisely how to interpret the rest of the world the conflicts have not been resolved and to acknowledge this it is not even necessary to point to what is happening in georgia and the instinctive reflexes of russia which continues to consider itself a great power we western europeans insist on believing in the end of war in 1909 it was the labour politician norman angell who predicted that because of the economic dependencies on the old continent there was no possibility whatsoever of a war between its major powers the futurologist h g wells said that the first world war would be the last of the great wars in 1989 the american francis fukuyama announced the end of all wars following the triumph of liberalism peace is an invention war a social phenomenon you dont have to take a trip to tiflis to realise this the 21st century is simply yet another bloodstained century
6963210 while people wait for brown to make an appearance in beijing a major debate has broken out about why precisely those athletes that attended private schools are winning so many medals this lends strength to the accusations of the conservatives that during its eleven years in government the labour party has accentuated social differences and is responsible for growing poverty and the poor situation of pensioners the leader of the conservative party david cameron depicts himself as the politician who will abolish these injustices has the world gone mad once it was the british conservatives who were seen as the evil party of the privileged now they are declaring a kind of social revolution browns optimism will soon evaporate
6963211 fallout from the credit crunch has raised hopes for mergers in the fragmented banking sector while low market valuations are inviting takeover bids in other sectors but german solutions are sought not a break up of deutschland ag public and co operative banks control nearly two thirds of the retail banking market but their small scale means that profitability is low with banks not up for sale consolidation is all but impossible the german government while not alone in its fears of foreign investors is not doing its economy a favour by shutting them out
6963212 the rise of protectionism is being borne out in germany to the great dismay of the economic milieu initially it was concern about the growing power of foreign state owned investment funds that prompted berlin to tighten its legislation the government wanted to restrain the ambitions of state investors with enormous foreign exchange reserves at their disposal in particular russian and chinese investors who are suspected of trying to use their stakes to exert political influence or gain control of technical know how the tone of the major corporations has now changed a year ago neither deutsche bank nor the energy companies eon and rwe concealed their worry about the appetite of state owned investment funds back then employers supported to a certain extent the protectionist reflex of germanys policymakers but this harmony is now a thing of the past the economic milieu is attacking the new regulations and pillorying them as an obstacle to the free movement of capital
6963213 regulatory policy disaster responsible policy must recognise the potential for danger with its blurred legal terminology the new ammendment to the foreign trade act could just as well facilitate deliberate abuse as generally broad interpretation inner security and public order are trite concepts which anyone will agree to they are wide open to interpretation and can be used to arbitrarily make any sector or company the focus of public concern they are fear induced concepts which put authority into the hands of politicians this is the especially alarming thing about this amendment quite apart from the many arguments against giving the state the right to intervene on capital investments by foreign investors
6963214 a strange decision brussels already transfers around 500 million euros annually although for years this has not led to a single advance in the palestinian question many billions have disappeared into the quagmire of palestinian corruption uncertainty and violence to this day the palestinians have not been able to transform their ambitions for a functioning national state into reality it may be that israel intentionally blocks economic development here and there but that does not explain why the gaza strip is such a chaos for example while under israeli control it flourished the blame lies with the palestinians themselves the palestinian territories are a bottomless pit how much more of the european taxpayers money must be tossed into it
6963215 the precarious economic and manpower situation at the airline has aroused suspicion more than one thousand employees are supposedly threatened with dismissal just a few hours before the accident the pilots union sepla warned that the company was forcing employees to work longer than authorised however jordi mauri the chairman of the workers council rebuffed this accusation yesterday without clear evidence the professionality of the airlines personnel may under no circumstances be called into question
6963216 europe is shrinking liguria is aging eastern germany is becoming deserted so much for the negative side of the report neverthelesss the studys sombre diagnosis can also be read positively as a recommendation for therapy the cure for demographic change is more movement on the ground this has been the reality for a long time now silent migration flows criss cross europe certainly the great migration to and within europe will not solve the demographic problem but it shows that the winners of the population change must be attractive to immigrants and able to turn the many faces of migration into their own trademark
6963217 if things continue like this the georgian conflict will accentuate the lack of consensus within the eu the us has expressed its disapproval of russias conduct in georgia in unmistakable terms if not quite as vehemently as poland did the old eu member states the strong boys of the eu have been more cautious in this respect although sarkozys eu peace plan seems appropriate as a first reaction in the end the old members of the eu could easily decide it makes more sense to make their own arrangements with russia on an individual basis this would once again be at the expense of the eastern european latecomers to the eu
6963218 the postal service is going its own unique way about preparing for the challenges of competition first it applied for several hundred millions in funding from the state budget then it plans to double prices for its services next year the postal service is a huge paradox it has over 100 000 employees not much less than the polish army but despite this there are giant queues at the counters in post offices and over employment has made the service one of the most expensive in europe it is impossible to sack inefficient and superfluous workers because changes are blocked by over 40 trade unions i wonder whether we customers have any need of a postal service like this because it is clear why the employees need the postal service to pay them their salaries after all unlike the letters the salaries always arrive on time
6963219 to understand the concern felt by americans over the weak dollar and the new rich from russia china and saudi arabia one need only take a stroll through the rockefeller center a deeply symbolic building and home to christies auction house the auction market is flourishing however no longer in new york but in dubai and hong kong the buyers are the same ones buying up british football clubs manhattan skyscrapers and villas on the italian costa smeralda the king is russian magnate roman abramovich and yet the revolution in the art market which is so worrying america can also be an opportunity for european art

6963237 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6963238 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6963239 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6963240 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6963241 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6963242 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6963243 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6963244 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6963245 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government

6963247 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6963248 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6963249 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6963250 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6963251 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out

6963261 when youre on a cell phone its a crapshoot where its going to get routed
6963262 but they were getting worn out and not making quick headway
6963263 there were spaces in between that allowed them to breathe
6963264 as we made contact with them a firefighter said you dont know how lucky you are
6963265 what made it challenging was that we were tucked right into a canyon and we had to work around some high trees
6963266 it was typical washington terrain 150 foot trees and steep canyon walls
6963267 i dont want anybody on top of it if its that thin that its going to collapse once we dont want any more weight on top of it to create a further hole
6963268 youre not supposed to be on top youre not supposed to be on top
6963269 let them know that we dont know that its stable
6963270 oh i think i might go in myself i cant let him be in there

6963280 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6963281 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
6963282 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6963283 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6963284 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6963285 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6963286 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6963287 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6963288 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6963289 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6963290 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6963291 statement muslim religious leaders call for peace justice in mindanao
6963292 increasing us military involvement in mindanao and us meddling in the grp milf peace negotiations
6963293 the presence of us troops involved in actual combat operations in pursuit of moro rebels in mindanao
6963294 the vfa clearly surrenders our national sovereignty and is being used to legalize the wanton exercise of us hegemony in the philippines through terror mongering
6963295 next to the february 4 massacre in maimbung sulu where residents claimed to have seen us soldiers accompanying local troops in military operations the baliki incident is another proof that the united states has been engaged in actual military intervention in mindanao wars
6963296 while philippine army officials try to justify the us troops participation as mere assistance in ordinance disposal this shows that the visiting forces agreement vfa is blurring the distinction between exercise and actual combat to legally justify permanent american presence and engagement in mindanao
6963297 governments failure to disclose to the public the terms of reference tor governing the presence of us troops in mindanao including the docking of us warships like the uss vandegrift in cagayan de oro and other parts of mindanao in march this year is highly suspect
6963298 out now mindanao is apprehensive that us military presence is part of the us governments double edged policy of engagement with the milf while it facilitates peace negotiations and provides post settlement aid package on one hand it is engaged in counter insurgency pursuit operations in the guise of counter terrorism on the other

6963302 if the leaders in the milf central committee cannot help the government then this will just show that they do not have the right to speak for the milf because they cannot even control their members perhaps we should not be talking to them kapag hindi sila tumulong nangangamba ako sa mga mangyayari sa susunod na mga araw

6963329 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6963330 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6963331 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6963332 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6963333 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6963334 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6963335 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6963336 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6963337 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6963338 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6963339 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6963340 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
6963341 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business

6963352 it is true that rajkot bds members were not part of the meeting with the cm and they are not even given financial rewards i have sent a formal communique to the dg office before doing that i verified the facts by visuals showing that my men had actually defused the bombs
6963353 whether it is one bomb or 29 the risk involved in doing the job was same irrespective of the location there were a lot of arguments between bds men and mathur regarding the rewards and elimination from the meeting with the cm however they were told that the list was prepared by the cmo and that the state police had no role to play in it
6963354 between 1998 and 2000 nagori was enrolled in the vikram university in ujjain he had taken up masters degree in journalism and proved to be a good student he was a gold medalist
6963355 in his course there was a dissertation of 50 marks he had chosen to write on kashmir and scored 48 marks
6963356 on the other hand rumours to defame muslims like kashmiri pandits being abducted and hindu girls being raped were spread but not one case was ever proved
6963357 nagori makes clear that his heart lies with separatist forces he has aired an opinion that kashmiri muslims opinion has time and again been ignored and that to quell kashmirs fire the government had relied upon guns and violence nagori claims that elections were held forcibly and that the problem is far from being resolved
6963358 in kashmir the residents are not given government jobs according to their ratio in population they get second class treatment
6963359 members were elated after modi praised them but once they came out of his office it was pande who sent out a clear message that they had forgotten the technical training given to them gujarat police cut a sorry face in the country as bomb defusing operations were shown by electronic media pande told them
6963360 the police chief even said that soon after visuals of surat police defusing the bombs like toys were aired on television they got calls from the national security guard as well nsg said that they could not have trained gujarat police who were defusing bombs in a non professional manner

6963373 the july 26 serial blasts were masterminded by mufti abdul bashar kasmi to fulfil the dream of safdar nagori who was arrested in march this year it will be interesting to question nagori even as the kasmi interrogations are on
6963374 the success of the entire operation was largely based on the disciplined teams devised as per their area of expertise
6963375 this system of different teams looking into different aspects has many benefits it keeps the investigation segmented therefore the possibility of an information leak is less also this increases efficiency and allows a particular team to focus better on their part of investigation
6963376 in total there are eight teams headed by dcp and acp level officials who are heading the probe at the moment as corroborative evidences are important the teams are also sent to various parts of gujarat including vadodara bharuch and cities of south gujarat another team is working in the city including visiting houses of the accused and collecting more information about the blasts

6963380 my lawyer didnt even tell me that there was a strike today i have come from loni in up this strike has caused me so much inconvenience i have spent a fair bit of money commuting i have also lost my wages for the day
6963381 what difference can a days strike make to the litigants this is in fact a good opportunity for the judges to take some rest besides the lawyers have got a chance to wear colourful clothes today usually you see them only in black and white outfits
6963382 i hate the way the indian government is still not looking at the oldest community of transgenders the kinnars and hijras whatever name you want to use the maximum number of those who are positive are among the hijras 22 per cent in bombay why cant the government do something about us doctors dont touch us there is free enrolment for medicines but hijras cant access that there is too much of politics
6963383 it is now clear msms are driving the epidemic but the whole programme is very rigid and it has neglected a whole population because it is invisible

6963386 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6963387 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6963388 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to nuclear attack one hundred percent
6963389 russia will have to point its warheads at ukrainian territory
6963390 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6963391 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6963392 we want to see the iraqis put their face on the mission while we are here to provide over watch and reassure them they are doing right

6963402 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity

6963450 for his own reasons hes determined to make the shiar the preeminent force in the universe
6963451 but vulcan is about to expand into space that the shiar traditionally have left alone some support this other see danger looming
6963452 now more than ever their goal remains unchanged whereas before it was personal for havok now its personal for all of them by the time its all over theyll either be the tightest most bonded group of x men ever or theyll be dead
6963453 death torture intergalactic war revenge jailbreaks the hunt for the phoenix a team of superpowered alien murderers brother versus brother and the lead in to what could be the greatest cosmic event of all time
6963454 darkhawk has a very specific role in this story which has to do with the job hes holding down when nova meets him
6963455 theres a good chance he might get involved in some of the bigger stories to come in both nova and war of kings if he survives secret invasion
6963456 hes got a cool design and hes an underused underappreciated character like nova was
6963457 plus with his hothead manner he reminds us a little bit of rich rider aka nova before he got all space war veteran on us
6963458 this is secret invasion even if you know somebody from way back is it really them
6963459 most great nations at the peak of their economic power become arrogant and wage great world wars at great cost wasting vast resources taking on huge debt and ultimately burning themselves out

6963461 the defense department has spent billions to fix its antiquated financial systems but still has no idea where its money goes
6963462 in 2000 defenses inspector general told congress that his auditors stopped counting after finding 2 3 trillion in unsupported entries
6963463 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much
6963464 why it takes decades to get them into production even as innovation in the civilian economy becomes ever more frenetic and why some of those weapons dont work very well despite expenditures of many billions of dollars
6963465 the internal politics of the armed services make weapons acquisition almost unmanageable
6963466 it wasnt fantastic but its something i can build on for sure and im glad to be back out here which is the main thing
6963467 setahu saya tidak ada kita juga tidak akan mengecek kepada setiap anggota karena tidak melihat urgensinya
6963468 hal hal seperti itu memerlukan pembuktian kewajiban kpk mencari alat bukti itu kalau fraksi tidak dalam posisi untuk itu apalagi kejadian sudah lama 5 tahun lalu

6963471 there are hardly half a dozen writers in england today who have not sold out to the enemy
6963472 do not fear to be eccentric in opinion for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric
6963473 cheer up dear even thunder and lightning wont stop you
6963474 son i am the way the truth and the life and if you would give your life to me and follow me i would save you from the hell that you have seen
6963475 you go ahead and execute me im going to heaven to see jesus but i pray that what you would do to me would stay in your minds and not give you rest until you come to jesus
6963476 but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
6963477 bingo we hebben hem nu kunnen we die lastpost tot zwijgen brengen
6963478 wij permitteren ons wetsovertredingen als we daarmee ons doel kunnen bereiken
6963479 i feel almost embarrassed talking about rent concessions when people lost everything
6963480 until this process plays itself out im not placing blame anywhere
6963481 what are they going to do to ensure the welfare of the residents here
6963482 it is nobler to declare oneself wrong than to insist on being right especially when one is right
6963483 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6963484 this is probably the first step in closure not only for a wounded family but for a community
6963485 i think its long overdue and im glad they finally found whoever did this so that my nephew can finally be resting in peace
6963486 the fact that he saw them was a small miracle really but it makes me sad for the people who didnt get their photos back
6963487 undoubtedly some evaluations of fair use will be more complicated than others
6963488 but in the majority of cases a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owners ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements
6963489 id like it if we just did one of those things where we call him the former lincoln running back or no 24 or something like that
6963490 i love the kid but god am i tired of hearing his name
6963491 theres going to be a lot of parity in the league this year and that all comes down to lincoln not having david henderson
6963492 im not going to lie thats going to help the rest of us a whole lot
6963493 when youve got someone that great someone who is dominating every time he touches the ball it changes the whole makeup of the league
6963494 you cant replace something like that lincoln is still the favorite theyre the champs and they know how to win but i think everyones looking at it as wide open this year washington lowell mission will be in there and so will we
6963495 hes not as dynamic as henderson was but whats that saying
6963496 we call eric a water bug hes really good and so elusive
6963497 hes fast hes tough hes a hard worker and hes all muscle
6963498 the guys we have back are a big part of why weve been able to impose our will the last three years
6963499 but the leagues going to be more even and it will probably come down to a few moments a few big plays here and there
6963500 we lost a whole lot not just allen and andre but about 80 percent of our offense and seven defensive starters
6963501 we need robert to step up and take the reins right away hes got a cannon arm and our success this year is going to ride on that
6963502 winning four in a row is pretty close to impossible
6963503 last year it was a learning experience in humility for a veteran team
6963504 the ability to win was always there it was just a matter of humiliating the kids into executing
6963505 with all the young guys this year we need to get a taste of victory early on to build up confidence its hard to imagine rebounding from a bad start
6963506 i think its unfair to say that i did anything that wasnt aboveboard
6963507 what do hamas supporters know of islam except the name we see their fanaticism for the movement as if it were fanaticism for religion
6963508 all match long i didnt think i played my best volleyball i got it going in the end
6963509 david lee just came up with some huge blocks mvp right there
6963510 weve got so much motivation weve got motivation coming out of our ears
6963511 the thing that really sticks to me is our last break
6963512 hugh came over to us and said heres what were going to do on this serve it had a great calming effect on us
6963513 in 39 though i was very close to him at the university games
6963514 he probably did not want to talk to me though i scored seven goals against the german team
6963515 and i was only an average swimmer so i had to do something other people did not do
6963516 i was never afraid to get into a fight in the pool
6963517 it was the dream of engineers for hundreds of years
6963518 i walk every day the path by the belvedere cove seashore one hour rain or shine

6963520 one of the most militant members of the weather underground widely known for his skill in making bombs and fuses had often criticized his comrades for limiting their bombing to property he berated them stating that true revolutionaries had to be ready and anxious to kill people it turned out that he was a paid informer and agent provocateur for the fbi
6963521 the fbi had informers in the weatherman organization who acted as agent provocateurs
6963522 the informers helped incite the weathermen to riot against the police and the establishment in chicago the ensuing demonstrations from october 8 11 1968 became known as the days of rage when top weatherman leaders were arrested by the chicago police just as the fbi hoped

6963548 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6963549 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6963550 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6963551 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6963552 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6963582 en aquel momento solo sent que hab a hecho realidad una idea del comandante cumpl a una misi n y nada m s como hacemos todos los cubanos
6963583 solo durante la realizaci n del primer congreso mundial de alfabetizaci n un encuentro de los educadores que trabajamos en bien de la humanidad comenc a comprender la real magnitud pol tica de la tarea la idea verdadera de fidel que no es solo alfabetizar sino vindicar a los excluidos de la tierra lograr un movimiento social que los una como seres humanos transformar el mundo en ese congreso casi me sorprendo aunque nunca averiguo cu ntos alfabetizados ya hay por el m todo yo s puedo ni por cu ntos pa ses anda no pregunto para evitar el susto
6963584 soy la misma mujer sencilla de siempre que hace cola atiende su casa sigo igual aunque internamente me siento ahora m s humana que antes lo alcanzado hasta aqu me ha permitido trazarme un objetivo en la vida seguir contribuyendo desde cualquier trinchera a eliminar el analfabetismo esa es la injusticia social m s grande que he visto en la vida porque cada analfabeto est asociado al hambre a la miseria al desempleo a condiciones infrahumanas y cuando t le das una cartilla y un l piz esa persona te besa y te abraza como si le hubieras dado lo m s grande del mundo entonces como es tanto el amor que he recibido creo que tengo que seguir pagando as con amor
6963585 con su mano sobre mi hombro y t sabes cu nto pesa esa mano es algo muy grande ya sinti ndome por dentro el compromiso que aquello significaba me dio varias sugerencias pensando en el uso de la televisi n para alfabetizar hacer una cartilla de cuatro o cinco p ginas y para elaborarla combinar los n meros con las letras y empezar por la palabra casa
6963586 aun sin partir de ning n supuesto pedag gico o cient fico l sab a que las personas iletradas conoc an los n meros y ese fue el argumento la palabra casa deb a ser la primera explic porque se pod a traducir f cilmente a otros idiomas y porque de alguna forma tambi n el analfabeto conoce lo que es si no la tiene sabe cu n necesaria resulta y si la tiene lucha much simo por mantenerla
6963587 porque imag nate t combinar los n meros con las letras es realmente algo dif cil ya hab amos hecho una cartilla muy amplia para la radio y aunque l no lo expres cuando conversamos sent que no le satisfac a porque era demasiado amplia al sugerirme una de pocas p ginas yo estaba percibiendo una cr tica muy sutil muy delicada pero una cr tica
6963588 organic entonces los n meros de acuerdo con la frecuencia de uso de cada una de esas consonantes y a las vocales en el mismo orden que se conocen les otorgu del uno al cinco
6963589 hubiera sido f cil adoptar el m todo para ense ar la lectoescritura en la primaria donde tambi n hay un orden para el aprendizaje
6963590 despu s de numerar del uno al cinco a las vocales la primera consonante que aprender an asociada al n mero seis decid que ser a la l de trazo f cil para aquellos que nunca han tomado un l piz y entre sus manos torpes de tanto trabajo rudo les parece un instrumento demasiado fr gil y a la vez impresionante
6963591 este m todo persigue ser amigable optimista crear un estado emocional favorable para elevar la autoestima y garantizar as un aprendizaje r pido eficaz a partir de los conocimientos de los propios participantes
6963592 en venezuela espec ficamente les llamamos patriotas participantes porque hay que ser un verdadero patriota para incorporarse a los 102 a os a un proceso de alfabetizaci n o a los 80 a los 70 cuando todo el mundo te ha dicho que no se puede

6963604 el fin de la revoluci n cultural en 1976 y la destrucci n de la banda de los cuatro llev al poder a un nuevo grupo de l deres del partido comunista cuyas ideas cambiaron la suerte de los n madas de pala sus ideas eran completamente diferentes a las de mao y la banda de los cuatro para ellos la revoluci n cultural fue una cat strofe para china cerraron las comunas populares establecieron una econom a rural orientada hacia el mercado que llamaron el sistema de la responsabilidad la responsabilidad por la producci n pas de la comuna a la familia
6963605 el impacto de los cambios se hizo sentir en pala en 1981 de un d a para el otro se repartieron todos los animales de la comuna cada n mada ya fuera infante de apenas una semana de edad adolescente adulto o anciano recibi 37 animales desde ese momento en adelante cada familia era responsable de su propio ganado y pod a hacer con l como quer a tambi n se repartieron tierras a peque os grupos de tres a seis viviendas que compart an el mismo campamento
6963606 otra dram tica consecuencia de las reformas instituidas despu s de 1981 es la rapidez y alcance de las diferencias econ micas y sociales en pala
6963607 mientras que en 1981 ninguna familia ten a menos de 37 animales por persona para 1988 el 38 ten a menos de 30 la proporci n de familias de pala con m s de 50 animales por persona aument del 12 en 1981 al 25 en 1988 en 1988 el 10 de las familias ten a m s de 90 animales por individuo en comparaci n con ninguna en 1981 como resultado de ese proceso de diferenciaci n econ mica en 1988 el 16 m s rico de la poblaci n era due o del 33 de los animales mientras que el 33 de la poblaci n m s pobre era due o del 17 de los animales en los ltimos siete a os del sistema de responsabilidad ha surgido una nueva minor a de ricos con una mayor cantidad de animales y tambi n una nueva capa de pobres con pocos o nada de animales los nuevos pobres subsisten trabajando para los ricos algunos de los cuales al igual que en la vieja sociedad emplean regularmente a pastores orde adores y sirvientes por largas temporadas

6963652 with the girls we started on the green and worked backward
6963653 when you are just beginning it could take 20 swings to get to the green and by then you are just frustrated at a young age we managed to avoid that the girls did have the same upbringing when it comes to how to take golf shots which enables them to help one another a lot
6963654 golf is a family activity that i never get tired of
6963655 it is really fun and i love every minute of it i dont know what i would do if i didnt golf with my family
6963656 shes going to make the team better she has worked very hard and she will only help the program

6963658 i love the idea of playing with a team even more than as an individual because you can always help one another out taylor and i have always helped one another because our swings are a lot alike
6963659 i really enjoy summer golf because it builds you up for the high school season but i love playing with the team
6963660 it is great to help everybody and not just yourself
6963661 doug and i do our coaching during the summer this is just tweak time at hampshire im looking at the complete team effort and not just at one or two girls in the summer the focus is on connie and taylor at hampshire it is the team first
6963662 she got a job at blackstone over the summer and is already eight strokes better than last year she has an incredible outlook on the game and i am looking for a lot more consistency from her
6963663 all of these girls will see competitive action this year
6963664 he swam several events by himself but look at how excited he got swimming in and winning the relay events that is what we want at hampshire
6963665 we dont mind sharing our mom because she is there to help everybody and make us all better as a team
6963666 its also great having her as the coach because she really cares about each of the girls and she cares about the program at hampshire there is a group of great girls here with a lot of talent and we are all the same type of people so we get along great
6963667 they did well last year and this year there is a lot of great talent our goal is to win a lot of matches
6963668 taylor made state last year and strives to get back
6963669 connie was right there watching and got a taste of what its like for me that was icing on the cake i couldnt have drawn up a better freshman year for her she put in a lot of work
6963670 i wear a rubber band on my wrist that i got from my coach
6963671 when i say something negative about myself i have to snap it because you should never say anything negative about yourself im focusing on playing the best i can helping my teammates and being more positive
6963672 it is going to be neat to see them go out and be independent competitive kids seeing the two of them go out and execute is a great feeling for a parent watching the team go out and execute is a great feeling for a coach
6963673 carly has a ton of experience and she is really talented
6963674 coming in i could see that we had a lot of talent but i didnt know how we would match up against opponents
6963675 im quickly finding out that this team will be very competitive against anyone
6963676 yes it is an individual sport but these girls love playing as a team
6963677 most of this team has experience at the sectional level
6963678 they all return with experience and feel that we can do well
6963679 were hoping to keep match averages in the 180 190 range
6963680 our ultimate goal is to make it back downstate which we did two years ago we came up just shy last season
6963681 were a very young team so the girls do need to gain experience but there will undoubtedly be growth in the right direction
6963682 maria is looking very consistent which was something she brought to the team last year as well
6963683 this year her scores are improved and already she has posted a career best
6963684 these girls love the sport and they always come to play
6963685 this group always works together to help one another which is great to see as a coach
6963686 we are going to miss our three girls who graduated last year
6963687 we have a little experience coming back but out success this season will be based on how fast our younger players can improve
6963688 taylor played a lot over the summer and is hitting the ball a ton
6963689 sara is looking much improved from last season and i have a feeling my freshmen are going to help us early and often
6963690 were looking to see consistent improvements throughout the year we are still young and need time to get going
6963691 they tell me that in the past year they have each bettered their scores by 20 strokes kristin is looking to qualify for sectionals
6963692 i want the girls to personally improve on their individual games
6963693 i would like to see a lot of career bests
6963694 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
6963695 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
6963696 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
6963697 i am delighted it will prove the whole thing is a charade
6963698 we did absolutely nothing wrong and the allegations will be proven entirely false

6963710 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6963711 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6963712 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6963713 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6963714 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6963719 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6963720 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6963721 with everything being more wide open and knowing that somebody would have to step in and make plays and pick up where bernard and moose left off probably has helped
6963722 i came in a lot more focused and determined because i want to win
6963723 i was told by a couple of the players that i need to be one of the leaders in the receiver room so thats where my focus kind of changed
6963724 if i dont know where im going how the heck am i going to help somebody else i know the offense really well i studied it i study it all the time i care about my job also i want to win period i hate losing so last year was horrible

6963744 the book is selling very well both through amazon com and on our own web site
6963745 we felt the time was right with the democratic national convention in denver starting monday to ramp up the marketing for andys book on monday as well with a new round of national advertising we are initially using the rush limbaugh and sean hannity programs for our message
6963746 andy is the gold standard by which all other obama authors are judged for accuracy and integrity his book is the only one that has not been attacked or challenged by obamabots
6963747 the fact that serious questions have been raised about competing authors and the fact that no questions or attacks have been directed at our book give us confidence that obama the man behind the mask will be the most influential book with voters in november
6963748 andys book moreover is the only one by a chicago based author who understands the unique culture of corruption in which senator obama has flourished
6963749 our advertising campaign will support amazon coms sales as well as our own marketing and barnes amp nobles when they come online the initial ad is being distributed to our mailing list separately as an jp3

6963889 i was getting off the train one night and started walking up the platform towards the stairs to walk home
6963890 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
6963891 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
6963892 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
6963893 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
6963894 we brought three individuals to be interviewed and after those interviews we were able to charge church with arson
6963895 that said we dont feel we have overturned all the stones in this investigation

6963934 a strong association with the unwto and adherence to its principles related to sustainable tourism was identified as a high priority for green globe international management once we completed our acquisition of the green globe brand and we are extremely pleased to have received notification of our acceptance for affiliate membership in the organization
6963935 the long and distinguished history of the green globe program in the global travel and tourism industry as well as the strong academic and scientific principles that underpin the green globe standards obviously position green globe very well relative to any accreditation process green globe international will continue to support the policies set forth by the unwto and will ensure that all green globe programs including its comprehensive sustainability and carbon neutrality plans meet the requirements set forth by the stsc

6963945 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6963946 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6963947 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6963950 smiling and shaking hands with a prospective customer are easy things to do that should be delivered 100 percent of the time
6963951 overlooking these simple gestures conveys a lack of respect for the customer or disinterest in their business and can destroy the foundation of a relationship before its even started
6963952 ideally a new account representative should assess customer needs and offer several product options before making a recommendation which occurs at 64 percent of banks
6963953 however 20 percent of representatives only offer one option and 16 percent give options without providing a recommendation which indicates that some banks fail to provide prospective customers with important information and guidance for establishing new accounts
6963954 not seizing the opportunity to invite shoppers to become customers can cause banks to lose business
6963955 ultimately you have to ask for the business to close the sale

6963978 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6963979 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and on the league he never intended for this to be the case

6963998 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down

6964000 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees

6964072 this is where i won our only tri nations match in south africa
6964073 it means a lot less baggage among this crew you saw the benefits of that in the first match against the all blacks a while back but ever more importantly the mindset of this team is extremely positive which is quite different to where weve been
6964074 the environment is also somewhat more relaxed and it revolves around backing yourself so hopefully that will help drive us to get a better result
6964075 playing there at provincial level and with the wallabies you know that it is not an as confronting venue
6964076 when you play even at cape towns newlands those venues are on top of you and its like a cauldron there the crowds can at times be quite hostile whereas at kings park theres still massive south african support but it doesnt seem as if they are suffocating you
6964077 you could easily point to the fact that australia havent won over here for a long period of time

6964091 we have to change the way we look at prisoners and i am willing to stake my political career on that
6964092 we cannot keep our boots to the necks of people in custody and expect them to respect society when they are no longer in custody
6964093 the people i have talked with appreciate the fact that we are giving the tools to make their lives better

6964113 i was also pleased to read that although edina is committed to improving the utility and usability of its services for
6964114 adopting too conservative an approach risks disenfranchising many users and therefore edina will evaluate how its services can be presented and personalised to address changing information seeking and user practices including access through devices other than computer screens such as pdas and mobile phones

6964139 thats what we talked to our kids about tonight no 1 we have to capitalize in the red zone and not make mistakes going in and we have to make smart decisions coming out when were pinned deep
6964140 we just have to keep training our kids to be smart football players we have to be more fundamentally sound when we have the ball i thought our kids did a good job adjusting tonight
6964141 i never thought id score four tds in a game but i did
6964142 me and quarterback michael clark connected thats going to be all season
6964143 the offensive line everything its just really coming together and its going to lead to big things
6964144 when you stop a team from going for two you take away an instant chance to change momentum they had a chance to tie and they dont and momentum can shift just like that in high school football
6964145 he had moves we couldnt wrap him up he kept juking our linemen
6964146 it was our first game so we were really excited
6964147 weve got to fix the things we didnt do well
6964148 its good to get a win but weve got to make sure we get better
6964149 there were too many mistakes weve got a lot to work on as a football team but i am proud of our attitude and effort
6964150 weve got to make sure that we are cleaning up the mistakes
6964151 that improved that was one of the things from last week to this week i thought we improved on were a more physical team then we were last week
6964152 i thought the defense played well i thought the backs ran the ball really hard i wouldnt be able to give away just one game ball i think overall were taking steps in the right direction
6964153 this election is too important and we must all get back to electing the best qualified candidate who has a record of making change happen in the country
6964154 i think experience does matter but it also relates to judgment hes a really incredible person
6964155 we can do e mail we can do public address right now for people who are on campus
6964156 we dont have anything in place to warn people before they get here with all of the campus shooting incidents it became imperative that we need to budget for this type of system
6964157 what it tries to do is make it uniform so everybody is using the same language everybodys got the same structure
6964158 it addresses disruptive individuals or individuals that might be in depression in class and maybe even a staff member in an office
6964159 it gives samples of what might be crisis behavior for an individual and then what would be the appropriate response
6964160 its just to get that safety more forward in everybodys mind and kind of ingrain into them these are the actions that they should take
6964161 the more frequently we do that the more second nature it becomes when they actually have to respond to an emergency
6964162 my parents were preparing me for it not being as good as my first try
6964163 the districtwide improvement trend is extremely consistent and its overall magnitude is substantial
6964164 these increases are a powerful indicator of systematic school and curricular improvement
6964165 were a large school district so we dont see drastic dips and peaks that smaller school districts see
6964166 but to watch these numbers go up six years in a row thats really school improvement

6964176 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
6964177 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
6964178 let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
6964179 just as i am just as i was just as i will be he loves me he does

6964210 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

6964213 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6964214 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6964217 disadvantaged low income people including the disabled homeless and the unemployed
6964218 wow i cant help but list all the reasons why this movie is horrible while im watching it
6964219 i had been struggling with the guy in the kitchen and he pushed me down but then i got up and socked him one on the jaw just like ricky hatton hes the man isnt he
6964220 i then went through to the bedroom and found my wife barbara with her head all bleeding i began shouting for the police and the pair ran off
6964221 i wasnt frightened and i dont feel brave i hit him because i was angry and it was instinct my main worry was for my wife
6964222 mr ratcliffe had something about him and he behaved with great courage and fortitude in a very difficult situation
6964223 it is really nice to feel this guy has been inspired by me i am so glad it turned out well for him you have to admire his guts having a go but i would not recommend this for everyone because there are some nasty people out there
6964224 i am in the us at the moment but am back next week and ill invite him to my gym there might be some nice surprises for him
6964225 the last time research was done it was valued that it was worth 17 5m and that was two years ago we would expect it to be more than that
6964226 we certainly know that this weekend many of the hotels bars and restaurants will be full because of the number of people who travel to manchester for the pride event
6964227 this is one of the citys pillar events and one that has been identified as being important to the brand of manchester because of what it says about manchester
6964228 manchester pride is a great showcase for the city attracting people nationally and internationally
6964229 businesses will benefit during this time as people coming for the weekend will spend in restaurants and shops while they are here
6964230 a lot of retailers are planning special promotions because they know the strength of the pink pound it will bring people into the city and they will come back
6964231 as the years have gone by the parade has grown and it has really enhanced manchesters reputation as a welcoming and fun place not just in britain but in europe and beyond
6964232 clearly the more people who come and visit manchester and enjoy themselves the better it is for the economy but the real benefit isnt just economic
6964233 it was amazing even after i had withdrawn the money for myself i could still hardly believe it
6964234 i went for a drink at a bar on the same street and heard what was happening from a friend i met there
6964235 people at the cash machine were texting everyone they knew to tell them about it
6964236 by 8pm there were about 30 or 40 people queuing to use the cashpoint and about the same number standing watching
6964237 i was in the bar and people were talking about it when i asked what was going on i couldnt believe it
6964238 i went across the road but i was a bit apprehensive because i thought it was a wind up
6964239 i only had 30 in my account it is not a lot but it certainly helped
6964240 i can confirm that an incident took place involving one of our automatic telling machines dispensing the wrong notes
6964241 we will not be pursuing people to return the cash
6964242 this was a deliberate punch on the ambulance member trying to perform his public duty
6964243 unfortunately these days its increasingly common to get punched kicked and spat at sometimes its because of a medical condition but other people are just aggressive and abusive
6964244 thats too bad you gotta go at the time our line was down blocking and kicking out we knew he was tired but hes our quickest back we needed him
6964245 playing with a bunch of new guys on offense i think maybe we got a little bit ahead of ourselves in that first half
6964246 but you gotta give credit to our offensive line in the second half they did a really nice job
6964247 i was very proud of our kids in the second half
6964248 considering all the youth and inexperience we had on the field we very easily could have folded up our tents and let everything go by the wayside but we didnt we came out in the second half and played harder and better
6964249 theres a lot of different emotions after a game like that
6964250 we just came out real flat in the first half and dug ourselves too big a hole they kind of shocked us with their running game we didnt think theyd run the ball like that
6964251 we wanted to let our offensive line take over a little bit in the first half and i thought we did that we came out intense and very ready to play
6964252 in the second half i thought we came out a little flat and played a little sloppy
6964253 you cant do that against a good team like talawanda theyll come back on you in a heartbeat
6964254 it was a field position game and we didnt do a very good job in that regard
6964255 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6964256 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6964257 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6964258 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6964259 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6964260 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6964261 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6964262 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6964263 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6964264 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6964265 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6964266 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6964267 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6964268 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6964269 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6964270 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6964271 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6964272 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6964273 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6964274 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6964275 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6964276 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6964277 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6964278 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6964279 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6964280 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6964281 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6964282 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6964283 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6964284 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6964285 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6964286 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6964287 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6964288 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6964289 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6964290 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6964291 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6964292 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6964293 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6964294 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6964295 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6964296 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6964297 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6964298 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6964299 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6964300 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6964301 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6964302 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6964303 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6964304 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6964305 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6964306 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6964307 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6964308 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6964309 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6964310 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6964311 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6964312 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6964313 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6964314 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6964315 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6964316 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6964317 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6964318 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6964319 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo

6964321 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley

6964327 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6964328 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6964329 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6964330 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6964331 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6964332 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6964333 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6964334 youre a tech evangelist youre a hacker most of all youre a geek how can you possibly say this you know more than any how badly our government mangles all the laws when it comes to technology we need this
6964335 run away as fast as you can i can imagine the headlines now americas cto today issued a statement about the russo georgian cyberwar or american cto warning cell phones may cause brain cancer
6964336 but the weissbier could only taste more awesome with a great meal
6964337 even the river front diners know how to serve it up in mannheim
6964338 the only thing more awesome than eating out was home made sauerkraut schnitzel amp mash potatoes
6964339 but the feast of a ham hock dinner and a massive stein of beer at the base the neuschwanstein castle
6964340 and of coarse last but most certainly not least the autobahn
6964341 18 5 euros each they looked at me funny but i guess i was compensating for the lack of soda throughout our stay lol
6964342 this technique saved my ass when i shot this slug in germany

6964347 yeah and thank the lord i could hear the capital letters that someone has a hospital for sick manatees
6964348 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6964349 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6964350 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6964351 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6964352 wir haben fragen nach der ungl cksursache gestellt und sie haben sie nicht beantwortet
6964353 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6964354 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6964355 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6964356 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6964357 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6964358 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6964359 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6964360 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6964361 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6964362 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6964363 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6964364 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6964365 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6964366 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6964367 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6964368 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6964369 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6964370 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6964371 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6964372 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6964373 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6964374 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6964375 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6964376 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6964377 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6964378 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6964379 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6964380 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6964381 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6964382 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6964383 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6964384 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6964385 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6964386 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6964387 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6964388 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6964389 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6964390 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6964391 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6964392 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6964393 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6964394 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6964395 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6964396 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6964397 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6964398 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6964399 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6964400 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6964401 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6964402 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6964403 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6964404 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6964405 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6964406 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6964407 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6964408 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6964409 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6964410 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6964411 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6964412 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6964413 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6964414 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6964415 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6964416 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6964417 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6964418 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6964419 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6964420 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
6964421 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
6964422 i honestly didnt expect to have this be a place where i could sit on the pole this is just an awesome car

6964510 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6964511 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6964512 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6964513 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6964514 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6964515 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6964516 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6964517 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6964518 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6964519 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6964520 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6964521 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence

6964557 im delighted to be involved with iron chef america supreme cuisine my video game counterpart is as passionate and competitive in the virtual kitchen stadium as i am in real life and i think the participation of chef morimoto and i adds a great level of authenticity to the game
6964558 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6964559 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6964560 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry
6964561 we believe that this company plans to sell the sydney site and it is about trying to increase the sale price of that site by transferring contracts there
6964562 spain is practically an exception already in south africa in guatemala cyprus timor it has been the state
6964563 shehas gone through the most extensive vetting ever of any candidate forpresident through the course of the primary
6964564 ive probably done more for sen obama than anybody in my position has ever done by this time
6964565 mostpeople never got around to endorsing the winning candidate until theconvention sometimes even later
6964566 the buildup has been so huge it almost has to be a major surprise to live up to it
6964567 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6964568 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person
6964569 i shouldnt be here i should go to quito and just chill there for a couple of days extra yea i should change my flight date to this afternoon and just head there ill email my peruvian family and apologize

6964571 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government
6964572 i did not like the tube in my mouth now go ahead and accept the rope in my neck
6964573 clearly reflect that the three deceased detainees required significant time to prepare the instruments with which they committed suicide
6964574 the possibility that the detainees used this uninterrupted gap in guard coverage to prepare these instruments cannot be ruled out
6964575 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
6964576 obviously this is a situation where the similarities are striking
6964577 these special cocktails need to be shared with the world
6964578 cant do anything in public because im mobbed by my fans

6964589 we had warned the government to target police and the army if it didnt stop operations against us in swat
6964590 these are my brothers i want to be where they are and continue to make a difference
6964591 i went to the hospital to see lcpl fisher the e co
6964592 here is a marine who just lost three of his friends could easily have been 4 of the kias and his way of honoring his friends is to re enlist to stay in the same battalion in order to return to the same place his friends were killed so that he can continue to carry the fight to the enemy and whats most important is that his actions are not an act of vengeance but an act of love a way to honor his comrades he inspires me
6964593 we are thrilled about the expansion of the popular petz franchise which is our sixth best selling brand with over 13 million units sold to date
6964594 in the petz games children had the chance to take care of a variety of cute animals with petz rescue they will be empowered to actually save and heal the wildlife they encounter this new line is designed to provide young players with positive messages about animal conservation through fun and exciting adventures

6964597 cnn confirms sen barack obama has chosen delaweare sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
6964598 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6964599 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6964600 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6964601 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6964602 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6964603 in tagalog and performed a certain ritual to cure the skin problem
6964604 they think that were right to try to encourage companies to focus on marketing healthier foods but they also believe they have the right to eat whatever they want
6964605 we dont want consumers to think were the cheapest guys in the world
6964606 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
6964607 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
6964608 we developed a lot of cars very quickly in a short timeframe
6964609 thats the way we used to do it back in the day
6964610 wed rather make it right than rush it to market
6964611 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6964612 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6964613 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6964614 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6964615 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6964616 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6964617 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6964618 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6964619 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6964620 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6964621 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6964622 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6964623 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6964624 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6964625 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6964626 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6964627 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6964628 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6964629 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6964630 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6964631 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6964632 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6964633 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6964634 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6964635 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6964636 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6964637 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6964638 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6964639 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6964640 ninety five percent of the worlds supply were picking up
6964641 i dont understand how people can get drunk on the boat at 10 00 in the morning and then spend a day in the hot sun
6964642 fighting time so hard i pray that this moment lasts forever
6964643 why do you guys wear so much black were you not hugged enough as kids
6964644 time it moved so slowly as if there were no end

6964650 contin a mostr ndose inestable apoyada por los magros indicadores econ micos y financieros
6964651 estos d biles indicadores junto al peso de la menor actividad estacional de agosto en china explican la baja actividad y el bajo volumen de inventarios de cobre en las bolsas de metales

6964654 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6964655 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6964656 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6964657 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6964658 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6964659 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6964660 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6964661 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6964662 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6964663 no quiere decir que no se tenga preferencia por una soluci n negociada
6964664 si en estos intentos por retomar la ronda de doha hay una soluci n para el algod n naturalmente eso ser a tomado en cuenta
6964665 si no avanzamos en la omc ciertamente no habr otro camino
6964666 vamos a tener que encontrar una soluci n y ver c mo es posible compatibilizarla
6964667 instrumentar mediante un mecanismo gil y transparente licitaciones p blicas de adquisici n de t tulos
6964668 de una estrategia orientada a disminuir la carga de servicios financieros que se deber an afrontar en los pr ximos meses aprovechando las oportunidades de ahorro que surjan a partir de las condiciones econ mico financieras

6964675 m s acceso a las mercanc as europeas en tanto que no se garanticen los beneficios arancelarios del sistema generalizado de preferencias plus y que los productos de inter s exportador actual y potencial disfruten de acceso inmediato al mercado europeo
6964676 el reciente descenso en los precios de las materias primas as como la creciente estabilidad del d lar ha sido alentador
6964677 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6964678 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6964679 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6964680 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6964681 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6964682 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6964683 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6964684 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6964685 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6964686 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6964687 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6964688 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6964689 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6964690 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6964691 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6964692 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6964693 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6964694 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6964695 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6964696 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6964697 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6964698 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6964699 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6964700 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6964701 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6964702 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6964703 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6964704 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6964705 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6964706 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6964707 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6964708 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6964709 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6964710 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6964711 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6964712 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6964713 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6964714 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6964715 taking some time off isnt always the easiest thing to do but i feel like im able to do it ok and not lose my swing by taking days off
6964716 one thing i talked about before the game is we cant do two things walk people and commit errors because of their propensity to hit home runs
6964717 we got away with it tonight but you cant expect to do that all the time we were fortunate
6964718 in the second or third inning i told the guys tonight was the epitome of being effectively wild
6964719 i was getting away with some stuff i was missing my spots
6964720 thats kind of a weird feeling about the situation here in chicago
6964721 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox
6964722 bu makineye bu kadar para verece ine st ne biraz daha koyar 40d alabilirdin
6964723 st ne biraz daha koyabiliyor olsayd m 40d de il pentax k20 al rd m kesinlikle
6964724 ive got cards and notes from people i dont know i cant thank everyone enough you people are just the greatest your support has been tremendous
6964725 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6964726 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6964727 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6964728 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6964729 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6964730 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6964731 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6964732 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6964733 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6964734 im not going to be defined by my age why would any woman im not going to slow down get off this ride stay home and get fat no way i would never get fat
6964735 gay guys know how to dance good its like the law or some shit

6964741 h r blir testpanelen helt lyrisk och vill g rna komma tillbaka
6964742 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6964743 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6964744 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori

6964749 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6964750 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6964751 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
6964752 the striking lack of these explains why poor people especially those in marginalized social groups like pastorates in africa women and children constitute the vast majority of disaster victims
6964753 to add insult to injury the bar isnt crisped rice in milk chocolate no now its made with chocolate and crisped rice
6964754 i am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed
6964755 os documentos eram deixados como garantia de que iriam voltar para pagar a droga havia centenas de peda os de papel alum nio que tinham sido usados para embalar drogas encontramos ainda cartas de traficantes dizendo que o com rcio no local estava excelente para a venda de drogas
6964756 eles sa ram escondidos n o vimos ficamos sabendo dessa trag dia na hora que um rapazinho veio nos avisar eu nem conhecia ele

6964760 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6964761 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6964762 it has been said that the contemporary age is one of irony where truth and the meta narrative have been shot through with holes
6964763 its not a straight up teen comedy not quite horror and not really a drama though when a chaste high school student becomes the target of male violence and discovers herself to have an anatomical quirk that makes her a living example of the vagina dentata myth things get uncomfortably funny horrifying and very dramatic indeed
6964764 we could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk about
6964765 in conjunction with the liberty to liberty triathlon the swim starts in battery park gangway one and ends in the north cove yacht harbor battery park city
6964766 this is an idea of president wade way before he became president he wrote a book on his vision of africa and in part of the book he pictured an african giant coming out of a volcano with his wife and his child and pointing out the way to development which is the north america
6964767 he wrote about it and when he became president he called his architect which is my good self and told me listen i want to make a big monument that would symbolize the african renaissance
6964768 as far as the funding it is not public money we tried because when you are in a government that does not have money sometimes you have to think of other ways of financing things than taking public money
6964769 the monument is in a site and next to the site the government has decided that they will sell some government land which is laying there for nothing giving it to senegal entrepreneurs who will buy the land from the government instead of buying it for the regular government price which is almost nothing we put it at the commercial price and they are giving the money to the government to build this at commercial price it is not costing anything to the government
6964770 i am an architect and i pressure the president to do things that will make dakar in senegal i do not want to say a showcase but as you see everyone goes to paris because of the eiffel tower
6964771 i want a lot of tourists to come to come to senegal because we will have the monument of the african renaissance we are doing the national theatre we will be doing the archives of senegal we are doing the african museum we are doing all these things because in the year 2010 or 2015 we want people to come to senegal and this is what will make senegal a rich country

6964774 the heat which thou wast fain to escape in the leafy shade and which thou couldst not avoid was the heat of love the heifer is thy mistress for of such whiteness is she thou thyself art the bull which was following his mate the crow whose sharp beak tore at the heifers breast was that old procuress who will corrupt thy loved one the long hesitation of the heifer and her final abandonment of the bull means that thou wilt be left cold on thy solitary couch the wound and the dark stains beneath her breast show that she is not free from the soilure of adultery

6964821 in true prophetic style the highroad brings you gods own word to your own heart that it stimulate a hunger for a deeper appreciation of the bible the supreme revelation of all truth
6964822 we have a government threatening residents with a big stick if they dont recycle and now the tories offer to pay householders who recycle
6964823 they have both missed the point the majority of the public is willing to recycle but lack the means to do so and are often confused about what they can recycle
6964824 the council is part of the community safety partnership and as such we investigate all offences of fly tipping within the borough
6964825 the offences around this type of crime relate not only to the actual depositing of the waste but to anyone involved
6964826 the council can prosecute people who fail to comply with their duty of care and whose waste ends up being dumped
6964827 this is a serious offence which can carry heavy penalties we will now be continuing our investigation to find the offenders who actually tipped the waste
6964828 we must be realistic and not in denial about the impact of the credit crunch on the councils vision for chatham
6964829 the council should have specific measures in place to ensure chathams regeneration doesnt grind to a halt
6964830 yet the council appear to be adopting the hold tight and hope for the best strategy
6964831 the current down turn in the economy is a cyclical part of the economy and occurs as a natural part of a free market
6964832 the programme for medway regeneration is over 20 years and so can expect to experience two down turns with the inevitable following booms during the programme
6964833 the present conditions are expected to last three to five years after which the economy will experience an uplift
6964834 at medway we are fortunate that during this period we will be putting in the infrastructure ready for when the market recovers
6964835 for most of this year we have been negotiating with a preferred development management company that would oversee this project on behalf of folkestone harbour company
6964836 obviously for something that could cost between 500 million and 750 million to implement a company that is putting so much time and resources into it is going to want a large return on that
6964837 however in the current economic climate it is clearly quite hard to negotiate what that return will be the situation changes pretty much every week and its becoming more and more difficult to get the numbers to stack up
6964838 its taking longer to sort out than anyone forecast but i would ask people not to panic as this development will go ahead eventually
6964839 it will renew the whole area folkestone is one of the most deprived towns in the country so we were delighted when roger came along with this wonderful scheme
6964840 its a shame it has stalled because we were looking forward to seeing it get under way but were sure roger will not give up and we will see this development create lots of new jobs and provide a more upbeat feeling for the town
6964841 we are very supportive of roger and we campaigned for his view for the future to come to fruition
6964842 however there are obviously difficulties in the current economic climate because companies are quite rightly concerned about where they are putting their money
6964843 the news from the governors of the bank of england was that the problems with the economy were going to continue for at least the next 18 months so its a testing time for a lot of people
6964844 we are the only area to have been granted area of water scarcity status by the government and this underlines the problems which we face
6964845 we have less rainfall than parts of the middle east and only very limited local water sources
6964846 we rely entirely on boreholes in the chalk of the downs and in gravel beds on romney marsh and have no reservoirs or rivers from which we can take water
6964847 we are convinced that this twin track approach which teams increased efficiency with improved resources will enable us to establish a long term secure local water supply
6964848 our company has been consistently rated by regulators as very efficient with high service standards and we are confident we provide a service that is good value
6964849 we therefore propose to create an opportunity for certain frontline services to be provided by licensees while we continue to ensure effective provision of mandatory security services by means of a tendered contract
6964850 the employment protections of transfers are very limited they seldom extend beyond 12 months or provide guaranteed proper pension provision
6964851 it beggars belief that that they should be rewarded with this unilateral board decision to terminate their employment
6964852 since 1995 thanet council has overseen development of the manston site to the very highest standards to protect drinking supplies and screen the sites intrusive nature into open countryside
6964853 is it one rule for cummins and another for cgp the integrity and probity of this council is openly questioned in thanet with many members of the public believing the that thanet council cannot be trusted to act impartially stating it is a done deal they view thanet council as morally bankrupt
6964854 the promise of employment is inappropriate in a planning application the applicant is clearly looking to the council to consider this application in the context of a larger scheme we consider that the council is not in a position to approve the application as a stand alone and self contained development
6964855 we have raised this issue with the secretary of state and have asked for it to be called in
6964856 there will be hundreds of lorries and the site is just visual vandalism it will be built on farmland and we need to protect and expand our farm land not build over it
6964857 if the site is not connected up to the mains sewer there will be no development
6964858 there will need to be liaison with training agencies to ensure people in thanet have beneficial employment
6964859 every councillor should have an input it is only right and proper that we have a special meeting
6964860 this application in my mind is no different to mrs jones complaining about her neighbours extension
6964861 there is not much detail in the travel plan and there is no suggestion on how this might serve people in margate and westgate for example this is a 24 hour seven day a week operation and the infrastructure is inadequate saying that people will cycle to work well i just cant see this happening
6964862 i cannot see any true guarantee that we will get what we are promised
6964863 the answers to the questions i have just dont seem to be available yet are these jobs just packing jobs the information just isnt there yet there is no detail in this respect how can doug brown talk about training people until we know what jobs will be available this application really is not ready i feel this is a rushed decision nd we need to have a single item meeting and this should go to full council
6964864 i managed to obtain copies of the applications after a struggle and it was then the discrepancies became apparent
6964865 wind direct said the gose document was the same as the one sent into maidstone but it clearly was not
6964866 the actual location of the turbine on the plans had changed it had been moved i feel this means the application sent into gose has no validity
6964867 to have any relevance at all it needs to be withdrawn and resubmitted
6964868 the developers have shot themselves in the foot with this i am delighted it has come to light but also frustrated things have got this far
6964869 wind direct included a site plan showing the location of the turbine which differs materially from the site plan included in the application to our planners although it was presented to gose as a copy of the application
6964870 we have been made aware of this and have concluded that wind direct either has to proceed with the application as it stands with all its inaccuracies or withdraw the application and decide whether to resubmit
6964871 wind direct has been notified of the councils stance with regard to the application and its inaccuracies
6964872 at the moment there is no date for a decision due to missing information which relates to information about environmental archaeological acoustic and details of hard surfacing
6964873 we know there is a real passion for quality food in kent and welcome the opportunity to bring waitrose to ashford for the first time so people can discover more about our brand here
6964874 we have to raise about 50 000 to help fight the case
6964875 dover council has up to 250 000 to cover the planning inquiry we are all determined to
6964876 unfortunately they are taking the same stance they have all along they are simply saying the local authority does not know what it is talking about
6964877 we are still in the early days of responding to the appeal but the council is in
6964878 we are all singing from the same song sheet we have to protect those of us who live in kent
6964879 its not just east langdon that will suffer if we lose this case the whole of the area could
6964880 dover district council had ample time to make a decision but they refused to in our opinion the council prevaricated because they preferred this decision to be made on appeal

6964884 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
6964885 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
6964886 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary
6964887 early removal will if nothing else retard the rate at which they are ultimately going to have to reduce trees

6964892 ledley is the type of player who would get into any side
6964893 he has top notch qualities and when he is fit he plays
6964894 football is so physical and you cannot put players in your side unless they are 100 percent
6964895 it is like having a rolls royce in the garage ledley is a player who unfortunately has had injury problems throughout his career
6964896 it is easy to see why we lost defensively we were at fault on three or four different situations
6964897 this will be the biggest baddest boldest exhibition ever that tells the story of african americans
6964898 think for a minute there would be no america without the contributions of black folk
6964899 from the arrival of the first slaves in jamestown 400 years ago all the way up to the time of barack obama were going to tell that story
6964900 we want to use temporary exhibitions to explore all aspects of american history and the constitution african americans from the beginning have been central to telling that story
6964901 most promising and innovative changes in academics faculty students campus or facilities
6964902 what they said is that those universities may not be at the top of the rankings yet but they are tops for innovation and i think this characterizes drexel so well
6964903 we think that our actual place in the rankings reflect that many of our peer colleges did not vote this year because they were protesting the u s news reputational survey
6964904 and also that this discrepancy shows the inadequacies inherent in the reputational survey and thereby the rankings
6964905 your father could sing the hell out of this song
6964906 theres no strategic decisions in this district about how to bring everything together
6964907 were causing our own problems by not thinking about things in a systemic way
6964908 for the young people who attend those schools its great
6964909 but could we have a situation where we didnt have to rob peter to pay paul
6964910 criteria to keep some kids out you leave the large comprehensive high schools with a serious lack of resources
6964911 innovation for the sake of innovation is not something im interested in
6964912 i certainly celebrate what paul did but its certainly not going to be good enough for me
6964913 new superintendents have the prerogative to bring whatever changes and best practices to the district they serve i did that im sure shes going to bring her own ideas to try to take the district to the next level and i wish her the very best
6964914 my job is to make sure we level this playing field so all children have equal resources
6964915 youd see many more teachers who are experienced going into more challenging schools
6964916 it is something that we would be willing to talk about
6964917 we may indeed have to go back and make deeper cuts

6964930 we are looking at beautiful or so the brochure says indian lake in denville new jersey
6964931 believe it or not this idyllic scene is less than 35 miles from times square new york city the surface of the dock is 513 feet above sea level it is sunday morning august 10 2008 about 7 a m and the temperature is about 75 degrees fahrenheit good sleeping weather for great blue herons apparently
6964932 the big guy landed on my dock drew in his neck lifted one foot and caught some zs he was there for about 45 minutes i kept a respectful distance
6964933 striding purposefully past the dock toward the kayak i wonder if hes also sick of the effort it takes to fly these days and figures hell try sailing or if maybe he just wants to get acquainted

6964936 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6964937 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6964938 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6964939 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6964940 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6964941 its like nuclear energy it can bomb you or power you lets harness it so it can power us into the future

6964943 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6964944 sleeping pills are also not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6964945 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6964946 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep about 20 percent of adults in industrial countries have problems sleeping at one time or another the institute analysed scientific studies that cover a wide range of research on sleep and insomnia
6964947 trials have shown that many people could get to sleep a little sooner if they learned relaxation techniques to help them switch off when it is time to go to sleep
6964948 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
6964949 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6964950 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
6964951 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
6964952 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
6964953 here we are a national landmark building and if we lose it you cant get it back
6964954 i would hate that if we didnt complete this thing you would pass by and say that used to be a national landmark it would be a tragic loss
6964955 what if you did this seemingly meaningless thing you put your hand on the wall and you were healed sometimes things happen because we choose for them to happen
6964956 is it that if you can convince me that its real your faith will be more real
6964957 the west should deliver a firm message to russia that if it does not respect the ceasefire deal and cooperate in implementing the international peacekeeping mission it will be met with a serious response including suspension of its moscows world trade organisation application
6964958 ledley is the type of player who would get into any side
6964959 he has top notch qualities and when he is fit he plays
6964960 football is so physical and you cannot put players in your side unless they are 100 percent
6964961 it is like having a rolls royce in the garage ledley is a player who unfortunately has had injury problems throughout his career
6964962 it is easy to see why we lost defensively we were at fault on three or four different situations
6964963 there hasnt been an appropriations bill yet to arrive on the presidents desk our government will shut down at midnight sept 30 if we dont pass some appropriation bills
6964964 this is the 110th congress and this is the longest congress has ever gone in history without passing an appropriations bill thats an effort i think to kick the can down the road and spend the money that house speaker nancy pelosi plans on spending after the election in such a way that the voters will not have an opportunity to react when they go to the poll thats my concern
6964965 another thing that is an incentive for them to bring something along is the ban on our continental shelf drilling expires at midnight on sept 30 i dont want to see that happen
6964966 i have said consistently persistently and relentlessly that i want access to all american energy and i want it now thats my position and its there because we cant get to energy independence with a failed economy we cant have a successful economy if were going to be hop stitched to the oil cartels and ship this wealth out of this country and pay a higher price for fuel when we do that
6964967 on that day sept 11 we were at war and whenever weve been at war weve asked the american people to tighten their belt this time we didnt do that
6964968 there would have been more support for the effort globally if we would have said were going to sacrifice here are all those things we want to do to expand programs but were going to have to wait until the security of this nation is better assured if we would have done that we could have a balanced budget today
6964969 my position is this i want all laws respected and enforced and i think that the federal government was first to blame because we went for more than 20 years with declining enforcement of immigration laws that opened the door for unscrupulous employers who realized they could take advantage of the situation and as they began accepting illegals that were here and putting them to work illegally they also began the recruitment lines and actively went to foreign countries and brought people in to do that labor
6964970 i am for a tighter labor supply which will drive wages and benefits up and put people that are doing unskilled work in a condition where they can actually carry their own weight in this society and pay their own way
6964971 that subject will be debated more between now and nov 4
6964972 if the public can muster the legislative support to pass legislation like that id have to say that im going to have to live with it but thats the way it needs to be done and is going to happen it cant be the courts who legislate out of the judicial branch of government
6964973 that should tell us that casualties are so low there at this point that its not on peoples minds any longer
6964974 i can tell you that there were about three weeks since july that the accidental deaths in iraq were higher and greater in number than the combat deaths in iraq thats not because we had unusual accidental deaths its because combat deaths have gotten so low so right now the level of security in iraq is high enough that its 4 6 times safer to be a soldier in iraq than it is in afghanistan that tells us where this is going
6964975 i debate every day so its not a matter of the debate
6964976 its about whether we have a credible candidate where there really needs to be an illumination of the issues or whether its just simply going to be a confrontation where there are personal attacks that fall out from that
6964977 what we do have is i have been targeted by the hard core left including moveon org and george soros i have made michael moores web page i have made rolling stones web site also i made the worst person in the world under keith olbermann those people are all left wing hard core activists and they have said theyre coming here and theyre going to try to change the dynamic in this race democratic campaign worker joe trippi has been hired by the other side hes the one who raised 40 million on a web page for 2004 democratic presidential candidate howard dean so you will see i think this turn into a very negative situation in this district and on top of that i know that push poll calls have gone out and theyve already attacked my family thats not the way we do politics in western iowa its been above board its been clean i have not run a negative campaign in my entire career its something that i think iowans deserve to know where we stand on the issues if theres any wonder ive been at this for six years no ones thinks im an equivocator and the access to me i think has been acceptable its never enough because its a big district so i dont know if it will get resolved with a debate but lets ensure that theres a credible candidate out there that really has a disagreement on the issues if we can have that kind of dialogue i wouldnt rule it out
6964978 never been changed since the restaurant opened almost 100 years ago

6964981 its tough non fatty stuff that holds the muscle fibres of the meat if you dont get it out it wraps itself round the spindle of your mincer
6964982 refrigerate the grinder to chill thoroughly a warm grinder can warm the meat
6964983 this brief curing makes the meat retain moisture better and enhances the texture
6964984 the gently gathered ground beef in a good hamburger has a delicate quality quite unlike even a tender steak
6964985 the combination of meat is very good if you can find short rib it produces a pleasing greasiness
6964986 well use his recipe when we have hamburgers again maybe in two or three years
6964987 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6964988 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6964989 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6964990 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6964991 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6964992 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6964993 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6964994 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6964995 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6964996 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6964997 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6964998 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6964999 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6965000 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6965001 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6965002 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible

6965011 kerajaan yang banyak aset berharga hanya menurunkan rm0 15 sen sahaja ini bermakna malaysia was was membantu rakyat tidak macam kita sanggup membela keseluruhan rakyat tanpa kira kaum

6965016 dia orangnya selalu ingin lebih baik tidak pernah berhenti belajar mas tidak pernah menyerah kalau dia tidak mengerti dia bertanya dan belajar kalau sudah mengerti dia akan berusaha melakukan yang terbaik kalau sudah terbaik dia berusaha lebih baik lagi pokoknya tidak pernah puas yah jelas dia menang lagi tahun ini
6965017 betul mas malah kita semua banyak belajar dari dia dia ini memang superman pokoknya hebat deh
6965018 wah mas saya juga ingin belajar nih saya kok tidak bisa begitu ya kalau lagi down ya kerja jadi malas juga tidak bisa selalu bersemangat tinggi apalagi kalau lagi bokek ha ha bagaimana sih caranya
6965019 saya juga sering mengalami up and down kok tapi saya tidak mau down terus setiap kali saya malas ya langsung saya kerja lebih giat kalau saya ingin istirahat saya langsung cari apa saja yang bisa dikerjakan kalau saya bosan saya langsung bikin rencana baru tentang apa saja yang akan saya lakukan hari itu
6965020 tiga tahun yang lalu saya ditegur oleh atasan saya soalnya saya lagi malas banget beberapa hari di kantor saya hampir tidak mengerjakan apa apa dan hanya main game lalu atasan saya datang beliau hanya bertanya kalau kamu sedang malas bekerja bagaimana jika perusahaan juga sedang malas membayar gajimu
6965021 setelah berkata demikian beliau pergi saya jadi malu sendiri saya tidak ingin perusahaan malas membayar gaji saya tentunya perusahaan juga tidak ingin saya malas bekerja jadi sejak saat itu saya tidak mau menuruti rasa malas lelah bosan dan lainnya
6965022 kalau saya sedang merasa malas saya langsung berdiri dan lompat lompat di tempat kira kira 20 kali lompat dulu saya sering ditertawakan teman teman saya ini tapi sekarang banyak yang mengikuti cara saya dengan melompat lompat sebentar maka peredaran darah menjadi lebih lancar rasa malas pun hilang begitu juga kalau saya mengantuk saya langsung melompat lompat sebentar maka rasa mengantuk akan lenyap pokoknya saya melakukan kebalikan dari setiap perasaan negatif yang saya rasakan
6965023 begitu juga kalau saya sedang pusing dengan masalah pribadi saya langsung saya menelepon klien yang membutuhkan bantuan saya sehingga saya tidak memikirkan masalah saya sendiri kadang saya langsung menghadap atasan dan mendiskusikan masalah pekerjaan saya tidak mau mengasihani diri sendiri masalah saya tidak akan selesai dengan berpusing pusing atau bermalas malasan kan apa uang saya akan bertambah kalau saya malas bekerja tidak kan jadi untuk apa

6965028 i explained to prosecutors transactions of the funds during the elections
6965029 i have to go and feed on the blood of attractive women from the local area you see my dear dr steadman
6965030 ah mas como voc pode dizer um absurdo desses n o passou pela fran a
6965031 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6965032 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6965033 some say this is what they wore 20 years ago already
6965034 now we are such a professional sport you see the tables and everything else looking different but the clothes yeah we have to improve a little bit more
6965035 i would like to see the girls wear a skirt
6965036 when i practice i do wear a skirt we just receive this you know
6965037 we are trying to push the female players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6965038 we say in french ne pas tre habill e comme un sac patates
6965039 or you do not want to be dressed like a sack of potatoes
6965040 that is a very good idea actually a must look at those tennis players miniskirts tight shirt
6965041 when i play for a european club my boss required me to dress pretty otherwise how can you attract more spectators
6965042 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6965043 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6965044 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6965045 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6965046 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6965047 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6965048 im so ready to get away from my parents and here
6965049 the city of angels the city great and eternal jewel city the impregnable city of the god indra grand capital of the world endowed with nine heavenly gems the happy city abounding with an enormous royal palace that resembles the heavenly abode where the god reincarnate reigns the city given by indra and built by vishnukam
6965050 speaking of the ladies its bout time you did portraits des barres and faithfull
6965051 here is the beta version but be careful while installing it as it may have bugs
6965052 nah just dont let me find out whos been taking my bottle
6965053 isnt it a bit too late to be introducing yourself only now
6965054 i dont even know what his name is cannot hear properly hate people who slang
6965055 hopefully those loyalties start to cement relative to budweisers future in china
6965056 at least in the rollout of new markets this year the olympics are a great image enhancement you have to keep building on the foundation
6965057 tremendous reach particularly with people that may not watch normal sports programming
6965058 you want each generation coming through to feel that the olympics are special and something to tune into
6965059 i dont know if the car i chose would have been the one i chose
6965060 a lot of dealers said im going to start stocking up on these small cars
6965061 im trying to get my hands on the smaller cars but im not going to pay an 07 price for an 05 car
6965062 if someone is interested in a truck or suv now is the time to buy them
6965063 for 7 000 you can buy a lot of gas
6965064 it would take 300 million to 500 million to recreate that brand awareness today
6965065 up against very tough competition and to be honest with you the brand had gotten a little bit old and a little bit tired
6965066 marketing can be a beautiful art form when its done well but its not a perfect science
6965067 at one point we felt very good about bugs bunny
6965068 but in terms of prioritizing our spending and investments weve focused on other brands
6965069 you need the marriage of a great brand and product innovation
6965070 the other thing thats important is that the category of snacks is different from other categories
6965071 the more snacks you stock up on the more you eat
6965072 you can stock up on all the shampoo you want but youre only going to wash your hair once a day
6965073 more and more products are going to have these networks of customer bases
6965074 as the population ages there are certain brands that really resonate with consumers
6965075 after 15 to 20 years youre usually buying a car for parts not buying them to drive
6965076 its counterintuitive in the auto industry usually cars cost less every year
6965077 the resale value is really going up on cars like that
6965078 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6965079 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6965080 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6965081 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6965082 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6965083 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6965084 extremely important not to overlook the insurance value that the position provides
6965085 the purpose of our hedging is not to try to win a las vegas style bet it is to reduce risk associated with fuel price volatility by buying a form of insurance against a potentially harmful price increase
6965086 we have a lot of big plans for mass effect having a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next one mass effect 2
6965087 well i wanted to be honest 3 of those are condos not houses im paying for this one so legally the bank still owns it
6965088 es tradicional que cambie en la ceremonia de clausura cambie el abanderado y ya es oficial que ser llaneras
6965089 no hay vuelta atr s en mi despedida es una decisi n pensada consensuada con la familia es duro retirarse as pero ya est tomada la decisi n s que al principio mi cabeza va a sufrir pero hay que hacerlo
6965090 that is what makes them a big team their heart you dont want to let them grow in confidence
6965091 they will come out better than they did in our preliminary match they are good at executing and are dangerous we have a job to finish
6965092 we gave away the first quarter and we paid a very expensive price for that
6965093 after that it was an uphill battle especially after manu ginobilis injury we didnt do what we planned and you cannot afford that against a team like the usa
6965094 for a subjective sport while the scoring might not exactly reflect what takes place the person with the most points 90 to 95 percent of times will be the winner
6965095 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6965096 i eat and seduce everyone theres a lot of kissing everyone boys and girls all kinds of craziness
6965097 ledley is the type of player who would get into any side
6965098 he has top notch qualities and when he is fit he plays
6965099 football is so physical and you cannot put players in your side unless they are 100 percent
6965100 it is like having a rolls royce in the garage ledley is a player who unfortunately has had injury problems throughout his career
6965101 it is easy to see why we lost defensively we were at fault on three or four different situations
6965102 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
6965103 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
6965104 the refreshing new visual style bold art direction and visceral gameplay of the house of dead overkill truly makes it standout on the wii
6965105 sega is committed to delivering unique gameplay experiences and the house of the dead overkill certainly qualifies as one of our most innovative sega games coming to the wii
6965106 involved have fulfilled their legal obligations to the full by doing risk assessments and providing lone worker safety policies for staff
6965107 however the statistics show that this is not translating into fewer incidents or decreased fear it is obvious that more needs to be done whether that is providing more technology training or simply ensuring that the safety policies are actually known about and adhered to
6965108 it is iconic it really helps define this community i think people have an affinity for that building where you took your kids and grandkids
6965109 moms get off the train every day and walk with their toddlers
6965110 i think the children would object to there not being a choo choo
6965111 most of us have been together for three years and were a pretty close group
6965112 but we hope one last shindig before the year starts will really unify the group
6965113 once the bells ring monday its going to be a little harder to do all this so its a nice tradition we have here
6965114 ive been in districts where theyve done cool things for back to school but theyve got some great traditions here at waubonsie that include everyone and get everyone excited for the year ahead
6965115 ive got cards and notes from people i dont know i cant thank everyone enough you people are just the greatest your support has been tremendous
6965116 we talked about how well johnson did and i said good luck with tomorrow
6965117 it was beautiful it was an amazing place and the people really made it more amazing
6965118 we have to change the way we look at prisoners and i am willing to stake my political career on that
6965119 we cannot keep our boots to the necks of people in custody and expect them to respect society when they are no longer in custody
6965120 the people i have talked with appreciate the fact that we are giving the tools to make their lives better
6965121 i am calling on all other jails and prisons to follow suit
6965122 i attended services there that were among the most uplifting i have encountered prisoners hugged us at the end with genuine love
6965123 it is time for the state of illinois to bring itself to that level
6965124 inmates here have told me about how they smell how they are dangerous and violent
6965125 i know there have been many people in state government who have been to angola and have been impressed with what has been done
6965126 my question is if it is so good why is it not being done here
6965127 there were some tears after she found out she didnt become a finalist but she got over it quick
6965128 but after the contest started she got a call from wrlr and has been on air singing
6965129 we absolutely plan on bringing her back in the studio after wednesday and have her on as much as possible
6965130 so while one door may have shut for her it seems like another one opened
6965131 i tore the same sheath around my spine back in 2001 in st louis
6965132 it could be a herniated disc from a previous injury theyve got to take a look at it this is something ive been dealing with it didnt seem as bad when i did it on sunday but for whatever reason my backs acting really guarded about letting it spasm out ill sit down and get relaxed and try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6965133 i dont want to miss any more time but it could be ready today or tomorrow
6965134 when i had it in japan in late march it hurt for a couple of days the spasm went away and i felt better i thought i was heading in the right direction thursday because it felt better but now its really stiff well try to get it calmed down and back to baseball activities
6965135 he actually threw the ball pretty well but we want to make sure we do the right thing
6965136 theres no sense deciding anything until we see how everybody comes out of their sides
6965137 now im going to give you the choice i was never given
6965138 oh yeah hot neck and shoulders oh look at those knockers those are nice hey a slim and sexy belly and waist oh my fucking god what the hell is she smuggling a sasquatch is she giving birth to chewbacca you need a machete and bug spray to get through that fucking muff
6965139 tis true my form is something odd but blaming me is blaming god could i create myself anew i would not fail in pleasing you if i could reach from pole to pole or grasp the ocean with a span i would be measured by the soul the minds the standard of the man
6965140 this might not mean much but i want you to have it thank you for the great summer i love you jared
6965141 buddy i always call him my buddy no amount of money could ever take the place of this heart given gift
6965142 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6965143 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6965144 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6965145 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6965146 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6965147 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6965148 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6965149 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6965150 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6965151 se presentar n el d a domingo 23 de noviembre a las 20 horas en el teatro caupolic n y las entradas ya se encuentran a la venta a trav s del sistema
6965152 the red cross has just announced a new disaster response partnership with wal mart when the next hurricane hits it will be a co production of big aid and big box
6965153 its all going to be private enterprise before its over
6965154 chemists supermarkets and other big stores are to be asked by the government to open a network of privately run gp surgeries to improve services available to patients
6965155 were outraged over the enslavement of domestic worker arlene by vice consul mandap and his family his actions are reprehensible and is a slap in the face to the millions of ofws toiling as domestic workers around the world we demand justice for arlene and all filipino women migrant workers
6965156 were certain these so called filial responsibilities shouldnt come at the expense of the human rights of others besides what about his responsibilities as a diplomat of a nation propped up by the sweat and sacrifice of countless filipino migrants
6965157 vice consul mandap violated national and international laws protecting the rights and welfare of migrant workers he even violated the dfas professed vision and mission regarding ofws he is clearly guilty of trafficking and thus has absolutely no moral basis and credibility as consular official
6965158 to recruit transport transfer harbor provide or receive a person by any means including those under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment for the purpose of forced labor slavery and involuntary servitude
6965159 no migrant worker or member of his family shall be held in slavery or servitude
6965160 our missions abroad are the partners of filipinos overseas in the pursuit of the national interest and in the promotion and protection of their rights and well being
6965161 penalty of imprisonment of 20 years and a fine of not less than p1 million but not more than p2 million
6965162 in politics there are no permanent enemies only permanent interests
6965163 we condemn this latest reprehensible attack against innocent civilians given how this occurred in the wake of the botched investigation into the glorietta bombing we demand a comprehensive independent and genuine probe into this unprecedented attack at the batasan
6965164 the independent probe should include all stakeholders and must be open to pursuing all possibilities in this case this means that the timing of the blast the current political crisis and all other factors must be considered in this light conclusions about how basilan rep wahab akhbar was the bombs target is premature and may even be another diversionary tactic
6965165 it simply cannot be discounted that in the glorietta and batasan pambansa blast the arroyo administration benefits in a sense because both tragic events diverted public attention away from very damaging exposes linking malacanang to the zte deal and bribery issues among others
6965166 we commit to pursuing justice for the victims and we warn gloria anew that instead of silencing the people these events intensify further our commitment to expose and oust her anti people and fascist regime
6965167 its certainly alarming that the arroyo administration couldnt even fulfill the simple request of the 9 pinoys for a philippine government official to be present at the dock when they arrive in mauritius especially since there was sufficient time to dispatch with haste no less than vp noli de castro if this administration was sincere in ensuring justice for these filipinos
6965168 so far all we have witnessed from this administration are mere posturings and speculations about how the has the arroyo administration lost all backbone when it comes to firmly standing up for the rights of overseas filipino workers
6965169 the plight of the 9 filipinos illustrates the cruel and unforgiving conditions our compatriots abroad are drawn against plying the worlds oceans while away from their families is enough heartrending an experience couple this agonizing fact with abuse and maltreatment anybody will surely end up as mutineers
6965170 migrante international demands that a government task force be created and immediately deployed to the area their job would be to intervene in behalf of our compatriots in distress and to make sure that all legal assistance is granted them
6965171 but given the arroyo administrations miserable track record when it comes to genuinely assisting the majority of ofws in distress were not surprised that when the 9 filipinos arrived no philippine official was there to welcome them
6965172 the government of gloria macapagal arroyo should prepare for even bigger and stronger resistance from filipino migrant workers in hong kong
6965173 contrary to what the philippine government wishes to achieve with all its repressive measures filipinos in hong kong are even more determined now to push through with our demands as the past months exposed the emptiness of the promises of the poea guidelines worsened the economic condition of our families and subjected the people to grave rights abuses
6965174 the development program of gma contains nothing but deployment of millions of filipinos abroad institutionalization of more fees and even more repressive actions against activists in the philippines and even against filipino migrant workers
6965175 according to our reliable source in the senate the arroyo administrations lobbyists are persistent to get the approval by next week to make it acceptable a side agreement on the toxic waste dumping provision is going to be included
6965176 this is unacceptable the arroyo administration thinks that it can always get away with her scheming governance first was the hastily approved pardon of erap and now the conniving approval of the one sided jpepa enough is enough
6965177 in exchange of toxic waste dumping and unlimited access on industrial materials from the philippines
6965178 we are not commodities the inclusion of labor exportation in international trade agreements only shows that president arroyo treats us like mere products that can be a bargaining chip in trade treaties this is totally dehumanizing to say the least
6965179 president arroyo has shamelessly abandoned all qualms in exporting filipinos as cheap labor she even went as far as legitimizing this by approving an international trade agreement like jpepa
6965180 we will not let this precedent happen we will do every protest that we can to stop president arroyo from conniving with japan to dump toxic waste in our country and let them plunder our natural resources once again this time at the expense of the rights and welfare of migrant filipinos
6965181 while arroyo raises our hands high for the billions of dollars we infuse into the economy the strong peso she crows about punches us in the stomach comprehensive measures need to be taken to address the very real impact the rising peso has on migrant families
6965182 fixed 10 premium above the exchange rate prevailing in the market or a flat rate of fifty 50 pesos to one dollar to be given to legitimate ofws
6965183 this means less food on the table less allowance for the children and even less money in case a family member becomes ill coupled with the reality that the rising peso is not resulting in lower prices for the people the situation of ofw families is indeed dire
6965184 in their bid to compensate for their shrinking remittance tales of ofws bypassing meals or taking out loans with high interests just so they can add to their remittance abound considering that a family of six needs p730 daily or p21 900 monthly to meet their basic needs even the new poea stipulated us 400 salary for domestic workers falls short since it only now amounts to p18 000 compared to about p20 000 when the peso was p50 to the dollar
6965185 foremost is an end to the arroyo charade that the strong peso is a barometer for development especially given that the record high exchange rate happens while more than 68 million filipinos live below p96 daily and more than 3 000 filipinos are forced to work overseas to survive
6965186 were outraged over the enslavement of domestic worker arlene by vice consul mandap and his family
6965187 is a slap in the face to the millions of overseas filipino workers toiling as domestic workers around the world
6965188 for two full years the defendant controlled and exploited this victim taking advantage of her youth and immigrant status
6965189 human trafficking takes many forms but the common thread is exploitation of the vulnerable particularly women and children
6965190 were certain these so called filial responsibilities shouldnt come at the expense of the human rights of others
6965191 besides what about his responsibilities as a diplomat of a nation built on the sweat and sacrifice of countless filipino migrants
6965192 he even violated the dfas professed vision and mission regarding ofws
6965193 he is clearly guilty of trafficking and thus has absolutely no moral basis and credibility as consular official
6965194 i was not aware of any problem that arose between them until ms gado filed a complaint
6965195 i took it back to san francisco only last february almost two years since ms gado arrived for the purpose of getting her visa renewed once i determined that there was no need to renew her visa it was valid for the duration of my status as her employer i sent it back to my in laws immediately
6965196 the allegations of human trafficking are absurd and grossly exaggerated
6965197 the case for all intents and purposes is closed my mother in law has pleaded guilty and agreed to pay restitution the state of new jersey has also determined that there is no liability on the part of her other family members including me they have closed all investigation into the matter
6965198 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6965199 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6965200 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
6965201 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
6965202 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary

6965218 when i first encountered the argument from evil as an undergraduate my instinct was to turn to the great theologians of the past upon whose shoulders i was quite prepared to stand little did i anticipate however the shock and the crisis of faith in store for me when i did just that for though it came as a complete surprise to me i found the writings of christian theologians to be far more disturbing and a far greater threat to my faith as i understood it than those of any atheistic thinker whom i had encountered the problem was that i kept bumping up against this awkward fact i seemed unable to find a single mainline christian theologian who truly believed any more than my atheistic professor did in a loving god they all claimed to believe in a just and a holy god but this god seemed not to care enough about created persons even to will or to desire the good for all of them and anything less than a perfectly loving god i was already persuaded would be far worse than no god at all so in the end the shock of discovering what the mainline theologians actually taught and asked me to believe precipitated a very real crisis of faith
6965219 ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes than the most hateful venomous serpent is in ours
6965220 perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love
6965221 god is love that is the rock bottom fact about god
6965222 1 it is gods redemptive purpose for the world and therefore his will to reconcile all sinners to himself 2 it is within gods power to achieve his redemptive purpose for the world 3 some sinners will never be reconciled to god and god will therefore either consign them to a place of eternal punishment from which there will be no hope of escape or put them out of existence altogether
6965223 desires everyone to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth
6965224 paul surely means only that god has not closed the door to any order of men
6965225 paul clearly did anticipate a time when all created persons would be reconciled to god
6965226 therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all
6965227 for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all
6965228 for as all die in adam so all will be made alive in christ
6965229 that at the name of jesus every knee should bend in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord
6965230 for god was pleased through jesus to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross
6965231 so long as an adolf eichmann remains merely a monster an irrational remnant of a person nothing he might endure spitefully like a tormented animal will teach him the hard lesson we want him to learn do we not want him to reclaim enough of his humanity to admit that he was wrong and to appreciate why he was wrong do we not want his illusions stripped away so he can stand naked before his creator only when the light finally breaks into his darkened understanding only when the divine forgiveness begins its work of transformation will he begin to appreciate the meaning of his punishment and the true nature of his evil deeds and then of course he will already be on the road to redemption
6965232 then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed every rule and every authority and power

6965456 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign

6965464 you people really dont have any clue yet of the true heinousness of what ive done
6965465 i was not searching for a child but rather i was on a rampage
6965466 rape and kill until i was killed preferring death over capture
6965467 i was on a rampage i hated myself and i hated you
6965468 i knew the best way to hurt you was the way i was hurt an eye for an eye but the system didnt take my eye it took my heart and my innocence and i wanted to do the same to it
6965469 evidence consistently shows that i have been honest that i have been forthcoming
6965470 for some reason that changed and i think the evidence supports that also
6965471 i should thank them but i wont despite the heinousness of all my crimes and the sickness the insanity the evidence shows clearly that completely contrary to all my life experience that something happened
6965472 this is not for my own salvation but this is for yours and the hope of all of us together
6965473 and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do

6965475 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables
6965476 go work in my vineyard and he answered and said i go sir and went not
6965477 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves
6965478 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
6965479 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
6965480 verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
6965481 i talked to several people in the nfl yesterday who undergo things and they assure me that peyton mannings articulatio is a huge anxiety for the colts apparently manning had to go through another procedure on his articulatio to clean things out after having his bursa sac removed terminal month what is the most concerning is not the second operation which the colts are denying but that they cannot curb the swelling in mannings articulatio and any physical movement causes more swelling once he returns to the game gets hit has to place a alluviation on the knee and intend the ball there can be swelling all i undergo is that there is much more here than meets the eye
6965482 if you play against the united states and your point guards and your team dont take care of the ball you cant get even if the united states shoots poorly from three point and the free throw distinction because they attack and score off of turnovers and steals

6965499 the russian government has few people with the mentality of statesmen
6965500 today the aim of many people is to become rich at the expense of the state
6965501 every russian who thinks is worried about this unfortunately there are no signs this will change
6965502 these days the economy is dependent on natural resource exports which is just a temporary bonanza these resources sooner or later will be depleted
6965503 if youre running gazprom a russian natural gas producer but you dont really own it then your interest is maximizing short term profits not long term development
6965504 if you look at most of the russian companies the energy companies thats precisely whats happened they have focused on profits or dividends and less so on long term development and replacing reserves

6965507 its more painful than most cellulite treatments but has a much stronger effect
6965508 as with many such treatments there is a smattering of science here which gives a sense of credibility in reality there appear to be no good scientific studies to confirm the claims and any improvement is likely to be slight and not maintained over time

6965510 the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
6965511 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
6965512 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
6965513 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay
6965514 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god
6965515 it looked like a spider web of extension cords its an absolute disaster waiting to happen
6965516 the first step to getting the things you want out of life is this decide what you want
6965517 its an honor i was a fan growing up so its pretty amazing

6965519 its incredible as a kid growing up here i wished there had been something like the concert series i would have been at every show
6965520 we had him boxed in everyone worked together as a team
6965521 a teacher who can arouse a feeling for one single good action for one single good poem accomplishes more than he who fills our memory with rows and rows of natural objects classified with name and form
6965522 i havent left my couch all day its been amazing
6965523 ill let you know ive got to go im being an asshole
6965524 i would feel loving toward her and kind and i would give her extra money

6965528 juan carlos ramirez abadia was handed over to the us drug enforcement agency in the city of manaus and flown out of the country on a us government plane

6965531 mr ramirez abadia is alleged to have been a key member of the norte del valle cartel which is accused of sending huge amounts of cocaine to the us and europe and laundering the proceeds in brazil
6965532 the last time andrew flintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
6965533 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
6965534 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6965535 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
6965536 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
6965537 we havent worked hard enough on how the referees are reffing the game and thats where weve really fallen down
6965538 it seems to be about how theyre reffing the game not about the game
6965539 we really havent challenged penalty counts and challenged that side of he game and thats where i think ive fallen down i didnt do much of it in pre season didnt work on it hard enough about their calls about being able to put three in a tackle and roll off and take heaps of time on the ground
6965540 if some part of its off you get penalised and were really poor there thats something we have to work really hard on as of tomorrow
6965541 it didnt take away the fact they were always going to beat us they wanted to beat us they wanted it more
6965542 we dont give ourselves a fair chance my attention to detail was pretty poor
6965543 our goal was to move into the last two games with a performance that was improving moving into a bigger and more important part of the season
6965544 were not going backwards with our preparation now weve had a couple of games where we were off over the last two weeks were going into a schedule next week with a footy team thats on the improve
6965545 pa would be a far more emotional story than cheeni kum which was far more caustic dry and sharp tongued in pa big b plays someone he has never played before while in cheeni kum he was a character i had seen earlier in pa hes a totally different person it a very emotional father son story but the emotions wont be melodramatic
6965546 i dont even want to talk about her but i was very hurt i really like rakhi why was she talking this way about me without knowing the facts how does she know the facts about how contestants were chosen i dont think its right for anyone to shoot off her mouth in this way you may have an outspoken image that youre always eager to uphold but please dont flaunt that image at my cost
6965547 its the channels prerogative to select or reject a candidate until two days prior to the show i didnt even know who was going the format doesnt allow the host to know the contestants mr athavle claims he was dropped on discriminatory grounds because he was a dalit and sanjay nirupam was taken instead
6965548 why was i being blamed if a candidate didnt make it into big boss why were they throwing stones at the channel colors office and burning my effigy why me every time im associated with something people try to use my name for their own purposes please leave me alone
6965549 but really rakhi sawant takes the cake what authority does she have to make such charges against me
6965550 i dont support abortion abortion because women should have the responsibil bility to not get rape did

6965586 as our national company we should all be proud of opera australia however as it stands now not many people are
6965587 the allegations are serious and we are taking them seriously
6965588 when richard hickox took up the post of music director i wrote to him asking if i could conduct for the company again
6965589 i was told that there was no conducting for me in the foreseeable future
6965590 i am at an age which is the prime of life for a conductor the time when he or she can give their best
6965591 passions run high in opera companies worldwide as singers directors musicians and designers disparage one anothers talent as they jockey for roles and positions
6965592 it is not surprising if somewhat disappointing that a group of the disgruntled are now attacking opera australia with a colourful variety of charges
6965593 i have been overwhelmed and fortified by the support i have received from colleagues and the general public
6965594 i am pleased that the board has welcomed further discussions from other colleagues i stand by my opinions and look forward to a positive outcome that benefits all our operatic community
6965595 i joined the oa when i was 19 working in the artistic department before moving to marketing

6965598 its a step in the right direction but there are a great many problems to be addressed

6965608 athens nearly destroyed me i was a mature athlete but an immature person
6965609 when i got home i took months off the bike and well you will just have to read all about it in the book
6965610 awareness of the emotions will help and getting the athletes to talk can be an easy way to help them out

6965612 yes they deserve to die and i hope they burn in hell
6965613 its actually my grandfathers voice toward the end of his life
6965614 he had this kind of high pitch whisper that would always make you kind of go whatd you say so i kind of wanted to fold people in around me when i talk to them or make people pay attention to champ in another kind of way so it makes you sit up and listen it was kind of challenging to hold onto it the whole movie so it was something else to keep me focused in the character
6965615 every character or every time i get a script that i think allows me to do specific things to change me physically i always give it to my makeup artist and i always give it to my hairdresser i let them independently say what they think he looks like and i tell them what i think he looks like al my makeup artist has created a program on his computer that just has my blank face on it and he can put my blank face up on it and then well start going through magazines looking at hairstyles well lift a hairstyle off a picture and put it on my head and well start putting stuff on my face change the size of my knows or putting scars on my in different places so this one al actually had a chance to wrinkle my skin theres this rubberized stuff that they pulled my skin back every day i reached the point where i could just go in there and go to sleep and they could do this stuff to me while i sleep three hours later id wake up and id be all pruny is this what im gonna look like later
6965616 i was aware of the magazine article yeah but the rest of it no its kind of amazing sometimes when you get involved with something how you just start accidentally running into people my wife was somewhere she accidentally ran into some of bob satterfields family they were all going yeah i had heard your husbands doing a movie about our brother da da da da da shes like what are you talking about because she didnt know we very seldom talk about what im going to do amazingly most people find that kind of strange so your wife doesnt know what movie youre doing next no she doesnt pick scripts for me she ran into them and she started talking to me about it and then shes run into other members of their family since then ive run into some of them too it was kind of great so theyre all going to be probably at the premiere

6965622 the average life of a mule appears to be fairly short

6965631 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6965632 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6965633 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6965634 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6965635 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6965636 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6965637 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6965638 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6965639 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6965640 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6965641 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6965642 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6965643 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6965644 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6965645 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6965646 unfortunately i just had a little trouble shifting on the last climb
6965647 irina was right on my wheel i had to put my foot down on the ground and she got by me
6965648 thats it i dont want to be 40 years old and still be on my bike
6965649 i think theres a time for everything and so i told myself that after the beijing games that i would stop
6965650 im studying towards a career that im anxious to begin and if i want to have a family life its not really possible to do that as a competitive cyclist
6965651 you have to make choices in life and i think im at that point
6965652 toughskin has always been and continues to be an extremely popular case for speck worldwide
6965653 our refresh of toughskin for iphone 3g focused on expanding upon the versatility styling and protection that have all become the hallmarks of the toughskin design
6965654 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6965655 south bronx residents cry foul as parks get yanked for stadium construction
6965656 we called everyone and thought we were going to be able to play a game here
6965657 its annoying because we never know when theres going to be a game
6965658 before it was good because macombs dam park was a big field and there was room for everyone
6965659 this isnt as big and its usually crowded its not the same as the other park
6965660 the new yankee stadium will be a gated community with no benefit to the residents of the south bronx
6965661 our elected officials rolled over when the yankees called and as a result the residents lost a beautiful park
6965662 ive had to get permits for so many new fields
6965663 irresponsible abuse of the environmental review procedures one that cost one of the citys poorest communities its sorely needed parkland
6965664 it was clear that at every stage of the process the communities concerned were placed last while the concerns of the new york yankees a privately owned organization were placed first when it came to the future of the parks and the surrounding neighborhood
6965665 no great urban development project comes without a temporary inconvenience to the community
6965666 we thank bronx residents for dealing with the inconveniences associated with the construction of new parks in the vicinity
6965667 i really havent been able to use the park as much as i had planned this summer
6965668 its usually either crowded or theres a baseball game so theres no room to play
6965669 wow come and check this out its like amityville in here
6965670 it is really too bad that you hit the northeast

6965678 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6965679 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6965680 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6965681 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6965682 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6965683 its the introduction to who i am because a lot of people know me as that girl from the pussycat dolls and people will get to know me now
6965684 ive always said that in the pussycat dolls i kind of feel like superwoman but thats just one of my alter egos ive got the sweet little hula girl side of me ive got the southern kentucky girl inside of me ive got the mamas girl ive got the vulnerable lovesick side of me and those are all on my record
6965685 im such a huge fan of snow patrols music and gary had this song called just say yes that just spoke to me i felt like i was supposed to make it my own and i was blessed enough for him to allow me to sing it
6965686 its a very honest and truthful song and i didnt care about what anyone else thought about my vocals it was just about my relationship with my song and then i finally met gary and i asked him did you like the song and he said you made my mum cry which when he said that it was like a sigh of relief
6965687 its not so much that im trying to move away from the pussycat dolls its just that i have this music in me and i knew i was supposed to put out this album
6965688 i think a lot of my music is healing and helping in some way or maybe it just makes people feel beautiful
6965689 con 204 pa ses y territorios presentes en los juegos hay muchas ocasiones para en que los atletas querr an hacer una manifestaci n p blica de dolor
6965690 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6965691 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6965692 ive had a great relationship with indian americans in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
6965693 well this malware attack approach is a new one to me if youre like a lot of people copying and
6965694 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the ministry would have a different figure
6965695 current use of a statin was associated with a 50 increase in risk of prostate cancer and use for five or more years was associated with an 80
6965696 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6965697 any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral relationship would include aspirational time horizons
6965698 were in the process of working out details right now
6965699 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6965700 by june 2009 if security progress continues there would be no need for u s troops in city centers
6965701 as long as iraq is on the table it helps mccain
6965702 the diminishing role of iraq in this election means the mccain campaign has to focus on economic policies which have not been the strength of the republican party
6965703 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6965704 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6965705 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6965706 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6965707 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in love is the only rational act

6965712 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6965713 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6965714 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6965715 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6965716 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6965717 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6965718 one of the big battlegrounds in this country in this campaign is how seniors are going to vote
6965719 hang in there youre a tough cookie and youll get through this

6965733 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6965734 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6965735 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6965736 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6965737 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6965738 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6965739 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6965740 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6965741 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6965742 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6965743 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6965744 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6965745 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6965746 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6965747 who are open to doing something on the production side
6965748 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6965749 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6965750 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6965751 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6965752 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6965753 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6965754 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6965755 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6965756 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6965757 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6965758 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6965759 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6965760 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6965761 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6965762 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6965763 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6965764 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6965765 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6965766 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6965767 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6965768 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6965769 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6965770 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6965771 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6965772 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6965773 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6965774 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6965775 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6965776 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6965777 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6965778 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6965779 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6965780 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6965781 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6965782 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6965821 the combination of these technologies enables a pc to make and receive calls over the jajah network and critically to wake up from energy efficient sleep mode to receive a call currently the inability for a pc to function as a phone in sleep mode has meant people are actually missing calls while their pc is powered down or are being forced to leave their pc running all the time which is clearly not very energy efficient with this new technology people are able to conserve power consumption by putting their pc into sleep mode without the risk of missing a call

6965864 it has embraced the ballot box it has created a fair and popular constitution it has avoided civil war iraqs violence has largely become local and criminal the violence while tragic has ceased being political and is therefore no longer nearly as important as it was
6965865 a persons past vote tells you something about his or her judgment obama talked a lot about the clarity of his judgment in opposing the iraq war
6965866 when he voted against the surge in january 2007 he claimed on more than one occasion that it would lead to increased casualties and sectarian violence it didnt howd he get that one wrong
6965867 in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed
6965868 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders will react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact
6965869 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge
6965870 the reality is that neither barack obama nor nuri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be lost at this point

6965904 i was cleaning out my china cabinet and ran out of room to place things on my dining room table so i placed one a plate on top of a candlestick i liked the look i didnt know if i was crazy but i then started making them as gifts for friends
6965905 i went all out and made a couple hundred plates and almost sold out and it was a really slow show
6965906 putting them on a candlestick makes a plate that you never would have thought of using totally usable
6965907 some have wanted them for anniversary parties and for wedding showers and receptions using them as centerpieces and to put wedding cakes on at every table
6965908 i try to match the personality of the plate with the base that i attach it to
6965909 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre august 7 position as agreed

6965934 i think the big story here today is that there is for the first time an expression by foxwoods to reconsider their current site and they are actively exploring other sites that are not on the waterfront
6965935 we have shared with city and state officials the obstacles that resiting would entail
6965936 following those discussions we have agreed in principle to consider other alternative sites and ways that we can mutually overcome those obstacles we are committed to continuing those discussions while preserving our rights to the south columbus boulevard site

6965944 from the arrival of the first slaves in jamestown 400 years ago all the way up to the time of barack obama were going to tell that story
6965945 we want to use temporary exhibitions to explore all aspects of american history and the constitution african americans from the beginning have been central to telling that story
6965946 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
6965947 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
6965948 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
6965949 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
6965950 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm

6965961 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6965962 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6965963 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6965964 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
6965965 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6965966 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6965967 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6965968 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6965969 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6965970 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

6965981 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6965982 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6965983 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6965984 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6965985 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6965986 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6965987 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6965988 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6965989 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6965990 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6965991 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
6965992 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
6965993 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6965994 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6965995 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6965996 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues
6965997 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6965998 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6965999 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6966000 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6966001 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6966002 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6966003 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt

6966008 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
6966009 experience is the best and simplest way to learn anything that is why it is so valued in the business world
6966010 it defines the corporations character and culture formal and informal networks all the elements that compose the dynamics of an organisation
6966011 in china for example etiquette and attitudes are very different so a successful strategy in europe might fail in china changemasters can reflect these cultural differences
6966012 some people have enormous influence in a corporation or department through their reputation or their informal networks of co workers
6966013 and we recommend that it is run as a seminar with a large number of staff forming teams to run through the change scenario but some companies like ikea run the game in small workshops
6966014 nobody wins nobody manages a painless project i think this is the way it should be it should be challenging and it should reflect real life it tests the limits of managers confidence the idea is for people to learn lessons and acquire new skills before carrying out a task in a realistic scenario
6966015 people wouldnt play the game or would complain about it loudly if they thought it was fixed
6966016 we initially produced an interface like the online game second life it had a 3d richly visual environment but executives spent too much time exploring the environment rather than playing through the games

6966030 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
6966031 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
6966032 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
6966033 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
6966034 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont

6966037 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6966038 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6966039 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6966040 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
6966041 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
6966042 es muy dif cil que con un fallo o incendio de motor un avi n se estrelle necesitamos esperar a que se realice toda la investigaci n habr tiempo de sobra para ver si el programa de mantenimiento del avi n era el adecuado o si intervinieron causas ambientales que pudieron afectar o errores humanos
6966043 para que o bien tener espacio suficiente para frenar en pista o bien pueda continuar el despegue y volar con un solo motor hasta elevarnos a nuestra altura de seguridad y hacer un circuito de aproximaci n de vuelo y de nuevo volver a posarse en la pista y esto lo hacemos todos los d as lo practicamos siempre en los entrenamientos que tenemos los pilotos cada seis meses lo trabajamos mucho el despegue con p rdida o fallo e incendio de motor es quiz s la maniobra que a lo largo de la vida de un piloto m s veces realiza en entrenamiento en simuladores que son de un realismo impresionante
6966044 lo mismo si tenemos que hacer una ruta alternativa en el caso de que nos falle un motor o tengamos que tomar un rumbo determinado y lo hacemos siempre en cada uno de los despegues aunque sean cinco al d a las cinco veces se hace el mismo procedimiento yo llevo 37 a os volando y nunca me ha fallado un motor es decir no necesariamente en la vida de los pilotos hay fallos de motores habitualmente pero nos preparamos a conciencia como si fuera a pasar al d a siguiente lo que pasa es que aqu evidentemente tiene que haber habido algo m s que hay que determinar con la investigaci n
6966045 cuando vuelves al parking el problema se hace constar en un libro y mantenimiento hace las acciones correctivas bien lo repara o bien desconectan el mecanismo para que pueda despegar si as lo permite el manual del fabricante porque hay muchos equipos en los aviones que est n duplicados y algunos no es imperativo tenerlos en funcionamiento
6966046 a medida que el avi n sube en el aire la temperatura baja y llega un momento en que si hay humedad se puede formar hielo y para evitarlo se utilizan estos reguladores que a veces pueden fallar pero como hay varios alguno puede ser desconectado seg n lo que indique el manual del procedimiento del avi n pudo tener relaci n con el accidente no lo s lo determinar la comisi n yo entiendo que no tiene nada que ver con lo que ha ocurrido pero se est iniciando la investigaci n
6966047 el trabajo de mantenimiento corrigi el problema y es bueno o aceptable el piloto toma de nuevo el avi n y si no el comandante habr a dicho directamente no volamos lo hemos hecho en cantidad de ocasiones cuando un aparato no est en condiciones ptimas para realizar el vuelo ning n piloto en su sano juicio acepta un avi n que no est en condiciones de volar a nosotros nos pagan b sicamente por hacer un vuelo prioritariamente seguro luego viene que sea puntual econ mico etc
6966048 en un impacto de avi n contra el suelo a la velocidad de elevaci n que ronda los 250 300 kil metros por hora se lleve mucho o poco combustible las consecuencias son fatales en su mayor a es milagroso que sobreviva alguien no obstante la cantidad de combustible no es un factor adicional en s este avi n puede realizar vuelos de cinco horas mucho m s lejos que a canarias que dura dos horas y media y llevaba carburante como para poco m s de tres por lo que no iba al tope si bien evidentemente llevaba bastantes litros de combustible entre 10 000 y 12 000 litros
6966049 obviamente estas flotas que tienen cierta antig edad gastan m s y por lo tanto son menos competitivas las compa as est cambiando estos aviones no porque sean menos seguros sino por su consumo es un tema de costes y rentabilidad que no tiene nada que ver con la seguridad
6966050 sobre el asunto de la edad en la aviaci n en realidad los aviones no tienen edad cada cinco a os los aviones son reconstruidos completamente y tenemos pr cticamente un avi n nuevo luego los aviones de una aerol nea son sometidos a revisiones diarias semanales mensuales y anuales dependiendo del n mero de horas de vuelo lo que nos lleva a un trabajo de mantenimiento continuado luego los pilotos hacemos los chequeos de los sistemas antes de los vuelos y tenemos sistemas en el avi n que nos indican si los equipos no funcionan adecuadamente
6966051 deb a cambiar la flota por eficiencia y competitividad es decir una flota m s antigua nos hace menos competitivos en espa a si nosotros consumimos un 20 m s de combustible que con un airbus esto significa un coste mucho m s alto lo cual incide en los resultados eso es de lo que nos quejamos la evoluci n de la compa a se ha paralizado hace tiempo y tendr a que haber seguido un proceso de modernizaci n de su flota adem s queremos tener unos objetivos claros a qu tipo de pasajeros nos vamos a dedicar pero esto no tiene nada que ver con el accidente son temas de gesti n y laborales y creo que es un disparate vincular el tema del plan de viabilidad planteado por la empresa con lo sucedido
6966052 nos hemos peleado con fomento hemos anunciado huelgas cuando se nos ha querido aplicar una legislaci n regresiva como la de las horas de jornada de vuelo y defendemos que ning n piloto acceda a volar en condiciones que no sean las aceptables si hubi ramos detectado un problema de seguridad en spanair ya lo hubi ramos hecho p blico
6966053 el problema de spanair no es un problema de liquidez porque sas est detr s de nosotros somos un parte m s de sas y eso nos da una garant a otra cosa es que a la compa a no d los resultados que sas quiere ahora de all a extrapolar el momento de la compa a o sus futuros problemas de supervivencia y vincularlos a este accidente m s que una temeridad es una locura
6966054 afortunadamente tenemos las cajas negras parece ser que est n en buen estado la mayor a eso se ver cuando se analice si todos los datos est n bien y pueden reconstruir el vuelo luego tambi n hay multitud de restos de avi n y por los efectos se pueden sacar las causas que los produjeron y est el libro de la vida del avi n en el que est n asentadas todas las actuaciones refacciones cambios o correcciones que se le hayan realizado desde su puesta en servicio por lo que todo lo que ahora se est apuntando acerca de lo sucedido con el avi n md 80 siniestrado el pasado mi rcoles no son m s que conjeturas
6966055 pedirle a este grupo de calificados expertos que sean capaces de tener algo antes de ese tiempo es una temeridad y correr el riesgo de afectar la veracidad de los resultados
6966056 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6966057 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6966058 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6966059 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6966060 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6966061 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid

6966086 there is very little charm in this misguided bunnys tale
6966087 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
6966088 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
6966089 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
6966090 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
6966091 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked

6966094 senator biden has a very strong commitment to a bipartisan foreign policy and serves as a good example for everyone in congress he has a very broad comprehensive view of the world hes a good listener but hes also a strong and effective advocate of his position
6966095 he wanted everything perfect always so focused on the goal not saying that coach z isnt as competitive or intense but hes got a different way of going about it he can make a joke he can keep it a little bit light and people arent on pins and needles around him
6966096 hes not going to get too excited hes not going to get too down he just zips along consequently the players respond that way they start to emulate the head coach hes an exceptional leader
6966097 hes done a great job with this team attitude wise i think the guys are responding i think the guys are enjoying it theyre having fun at practice he generates a great optimism
6966098 we are here because we believe our voice is not strong enough
6966099 stop the division of our families by raids and deportations
6966100 we want to tell the pope he can stop raids stop separating families
6966101 hes recognized already the presence of an important group in this country
6966102 the message is one of compassion one of understanding the plea of immigrants without taking anything from the rights of nations to create borders and defend those borders
6966103 i invite host communities to welcome the young and very young people with their parents with sympathy
6966104 there is no reason american taxpayers should carry the burden of drawn out repatriation negotiations for criminal aliens
6966105 let me give you one example the united states government paid 200 000 to fly an illegal alien convicted of assault back to his home country of somalia only to be denied entrance and ultimately released in the united states
6966106 there is an enormous problem of public safety which is slightly under the radar screen because when somebody is convicted an illegal alien is convicted and serves a sentence for example aggravated robbery spends five years in jail serves the maximum whatever it may be is released back on the streets if the home country will not take them as many will not immigration can detain them for only six months and then theyre a menace on the streets
6966107 we intend to put teeth into the law by basically issuing sanctions prohibiting visas from individuals coming from those countries
6966108 and weve identified about eight countries where there are about 139 000 illegal aliens where these countries are refusing to repatriate about 139 000 illegal aliens those countries include vietnam jamaica china india ethiopia laos eritrea iran 139 000 of them
6966109 its been very frustrating when we have occasions where someone serves their sentence we want to ship them out we cant ship them out because either they have a legal basis to block it under the convention or the country wont take them back and then we cant hold them
6966110 so i think at a minimum we should be able to hold them and i do believe actually this is something where a legislative cure is appropriate
6966111 but that cannot be done under international law unless a regulation is adopted by your department
6966112 canada has such a regulation canada has a good record on human rights but your department has not adopted that regulation
6966113 free capital mobility totally undercuts ricardos comparative advantage argument for free trade in goods because that argument is explicitly and essentially premised on capital and other factors being immobile between nations under the new globalization regime capital tends simply to flow to wherever costs are lowest that is to pursue absolute advantage

6966126 as youve probably guessed by now the ucp 1100w is a 1100 watt power supply with a maximum output of 1320 watts which conforms to the 80 plus silver efficiency standard with an efficiency rating of 89 05 at 50 load and 86 99 on average making it one of the first psus in this particular power range to gain such certification with all of that power at its disposal youd expect to see it paired up with a lot of connectivity cabling wise and thats exactly what we find here aside from the normal 24 pin power and a couple of eight pin motherboard power connectors the ucp 1100w also supports a single floppy drive nine serial ata devices and five molex connectors the power supply certainly isnt lacking in its support for pci express graphics boards with three eight pin and six six pin pci express power connectors on offer here too needless to say this unit is also nvidia sli certified and running 3 way or quad sli as well as crossfirex should be possible with the amount of power and connectivity on show here

6966131 our defense really stepped up tonight it bailed us out quite a bit
6966132 we had ample opportunities to put the game away three or four times and the offense sputtered but the defense stepped up every time and made a good stand for us
6966133 the first half we werent getting a lot of pressure on him and when youre not getting pressure on the quarterback your defensive backs can only cover for so long
6966134 in the second half we started sending more pressure and we came out of our zone a little and kind of mixed it up and he didnt have as much time to set up and get comfortable
6966135 the punt return was huge that gave us the momentum
6966136 that hurt the punt return was not a good thing for us obviously
6966137 we got opportunities we had plenty of opportunities to win the ballgame
6966138 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
6966139 the striking lack of these explains why poor people especially those in marginalized social groups like pastorates in africa women and children constitute the vast majority of disaster victims
6966140 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
6966141 democrats because weve burned in the last few elections get nervous and skittish right around this time
6966142 it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit ba rack o bama theyre still getting past that name
6966143 an unwavering belief in the idea of america the idea that no matter where you come from or what you look like or who your parents are this is a place where anything is possible
6966144 hes seen as different his race is the most obvious thing the question for voters then becomes does he understand my views
6966145 hes still kind of a stranger or an enigma to a lot of voters
6966146 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6966147 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
6966148 if he doesnt say much then he is not inoculating himself but if he brings it up he reminds people of it
6966149 a lot of americans are very happy to vote for a non threatening black person but if they see a black person who is surrounded by other threatening black people they make up reasons why its not ok
6966150 i think obama is vulnerable in terms of celebrity and elitism
6966151 theres a perception that he is talking down to people telling them they are worried about the wrong thing and saying heres what you should be worried about
6966152 i dont think americans are really interested if he is a citizen of the world or not
6966153 there was a presumption by obama that he had already won the white house and was already president
6966154 the view that people have of his oratorical skills is so high that its going to be difficult to manage expectations
6966155 one of the reasons people were excited about obama in the first place was that he promised change but the content of the change he promised wasnt really specified he has to deliver on the lyrical promise make us believe he is a transcendent leader but also spell out the nuts and bolts of change he is going to try to implement
6966156 these experiments are aimed at better understanding the factors that motivate consumers to engage in actions for the benefit of the environment this important topic along with pro social behavior in general is a severely understudied area of consumer research
6966157 join your fellow guests in helping to save the environment
6966158 the results of our studies have clear implications for marketers managers and policymakers it is worth noting that the normative messages which were messages that we have never seen utilized by hotel chains fared significantly better at spurring participation in the hotel s environmental conservation program than did the type of message most commonly utilized by hotel chains messages that focus on the importance of environmental protection
6966159 we are exchanging details of the project with the opposition in a cordial atmosphere we are discussing this issue with the opposition and trying to solve it at highest level
6966160 if government and tata think they can solve the problem we are agreed for that purpose if 600 acres of it be kept for tata car project and 400 acres of land be handed to farmers which has been forcefully occupied and then this matter may be solved
6966161 their statements might have helped us but most of it was clear from the beginning
6966162 common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen
6966163 it is very important that you look for balance you look for balance between studies and sports it is only when you balance your activities and you do a mixture of activities that you truly begin to learn so i am very happy to open this kabaddi meet
6966164 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race
6966165 i think we are definitely capable of running under three minutes
6966166 i think we can break the australian record its 2 59 70
6966167 we ran three minutes point six and this is our b team and with sean wroe in here i think we can do that it just depends how the race is going and the changes pan out
6966168 to a large degree its not who works the hardest who wins but who had the genetic gods look down on them with favour and the bolts of the world fit that category
6966169 since jamaica was one of the last stops to be made by the slave ships it ensured that only the most resilient and fittest of slaves were alive to disembark
6966170 i dont think we can ignore that we all look and perform differently in different situations
6966171 its not that one ethnic group has an overall advantage its just there are strengths and weaknesses in different populations throughout the earth that are influenced by the environment in which they have lived and in which certain traits have evolved
6966172 the word race doesnt really apply look at east africa versus west africa theyre all africans but the body types of kenyans and ethiopians are very different to west africans
6966173 and you can see it in swimming you can make all kinds of cases that blacks are culturally disadvantaged in swimming but the reality is the black body type is not suited to being great swimmers
6966174 at the moment we know only of a couple of genes probably less than 10 that have been shown to have some influence on the different types of human physical performance
6966175 you dont need to do a molecular test to see if someones tall and a stopwatch does a pretty good job of telling you if someones fast
6966176 the key point is to implement research to understand the value of genetic information and this is the area that spooks people and they get caught up in a the race angle and b the genetic manipulation gene therapy side of things when people hear the g word they jump to conclusions
6966177 a year or two ago because there are so many other things that make a champion i thought we could wait and see what the scientists come up with but i worry that because you can see countries around the world starting to do the research we need to be on the front foot
6966178 australia has to be in the game and we have to do it really well and we have to get reliable information so we can make sense of our talent screening strategies
6966179 where we might end up with all this research is with a set of genetic variations and if youve got this one this one this one this one and this one the chances are youll be a much better athlete than someone whos only got two of those genes
6966180 just in raw potential thats what the scientists are interested in to see how accurate and how reliable having that genetic information might be if you had no other information at all would it really help you select the next champion
6966181 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6966182 in these conditions anything can happen especially with the heat
6966183 i was getting ice packs every lap and putting them down my back thats what saved me
6966184 i knew i was going to suffer it was hard hot this course was so difficult
6966185 there was nowhere to settle in there was no way to fake it on the climbs you had to go all out
6966186 god works slowly according to our individual needs better than anyone he knows that doing it all at once would reduce us to shivering panic
6966187 but its one of those oh geez find another way to lose at least we showed some life it seemed the last few times the closer comes in and boom were done
6966188 i just went back to pitching the way i did last year
6966189 trying to throw harder strike more guys out and get more ground balls just made things worse
6966190 im going back to what i am its not glamorous its not flashy but im good at it
6966191 all youve got to do is put the ball in play
6966192 and youve got a run thats one of those things right now
6966193 he got back there on the ball and made a perfect throw there was no hesitation but i certainly thought it would have been closer
6966194 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
6966195 they didnt take money it goes to heaths daughter the three actors were totally heroic coming in this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help
6966196 my music and my clothes are really a reflection of who i am and its been really cool to see that resonate with my fans
6966197 more concerned with reflecting what he believes is right for indiana citizens than with playing to the beltway crowd
6966198 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6966199 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6966200 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6966201 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6966202 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6966203 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6966204 i was not the source of every story about alycia lane or the sole source on many but i was a source and i was getting some of the information from her e mails
6966205 the likelihood exists that we will have to assist residents who may be trapped in their homes without the ability to leave because of flooded roads
6966206 my house never flooded and ive been here since 1999
6966207 its just too much water theres no where for it to go
6966208 affected with flooding and some affected with no potable water due to flooded wells officials aid in a recently released statement
6966209 as a result the city is encouraging residents to keep water usage to a minimum including limiting the use of washing machines dishwashers and showers until after the storm passes a city news release said
6966210 his personnel file has junk in it its not worth considering

6966212 the system is flawed the system doesnt work well and in my opinion the system causes more problems
6966213 i dont agree that he should have had sex i dont agree that lt curtis breaux told him he should have sex
6966214 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
6966215 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
6966216 obviously you havent listened to the tapes yes i did
6966217 theres a glaring incident that i have to question having sex with someone who is not your wife
6966218 i have very high morals but they are being attacked because of something i did for the city
6966219 apparently he didnt think it was appropriate for the department
6966220 he couldnt handle the heat the public found out about it and that put the pressure on the city
6966221 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6966222 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6966223 they will certainly now say that reports that she was 13 in 2007 were incorrect so that she keeps her gold medal
6966224 changing ones age in china especially in the past is very common when i was at school i changed my age to get into the class i wanted later i changed it back
6966225 it used to be very common but it is getting less and less so
6966226 whatever critics may say of the chinese games the over manipulation and excessive controls the big story is about sheer power and competence from the breathtaking opening ceremony the scale and modernity of the infrastructure the quality of the technology the smooth running of the events and the success of the chinese team
6966227 we should make contributions to the country i understand we are a socialist family
6966228 i just want ask this one question are farmers not people
6966229 a number of farmers are not big earners in income
6966230 they can not spend money to see beijing olympics from within the heart it is not fair

6966255 faith was a huge part of his life and really for all of us as friends
6966256 no matter where he was he was always at church on sunday
6966257 the point is he wasnt so focused on his own career he wouldnt take time to help people out with theirs

6966268 that is what makes them a big team their heart you dont want to let them grow in confidence
6966269 they will come out better than they did in our preliminary match they are good at executing and are dangerous we have a job to finish
6966270 we gave away the first quarter and we paid a very expensive price for that
6966271 after that it was an uphill battle especially after manu ginobilis injury we didnt do what we planned and you cannot afford that against a team like the usa
6966272 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6966273 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6966274 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6966275 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6966276 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6966277 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6966278 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6966279 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6966280 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here

6966317 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6966318 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6966319 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6966320 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6966321 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6966324 its effect on the canadian market place will be decided by retailers and packing plants and their ability to efficiently comply
6966325 in this day and age being able to access food products from around the world is absolutely essential we strongly oppose any barriers to trade that prevent us from sourcing the best products possible for consumers

6966327 pork that goes into processing is not subject to cool nor is pork used in food service or pork that is exported from the
6966328 stormready encourages communities to take a new proactive approach to improving local hazardous weather operations and public awareness
6966329 stormready arms communities with improved communication and safety skills needed to save lives and property before and during the event
6966330 airports are significantly impacted by weather and this new designation is reflective of our airports commitment to operating the safest possible air transportation facilities for our customers and the communities we serve
6966331 the united states is the most severe weather prone region of the world the mission of the national weather service is to reduce the loss of life and property from these storms and stormready will help us create better prepared communities throughout the country
6966332 just like communities businesses and families need to be storm ready by having an action plan for severe weather through stormready the national weather service plans to educate every american about what to do when severe weather strikes because it is ultimately each individuals responsibility to protect him or herself
6966333 we view being the first airport system in the country to receive stormready designation as more of a responsibility than an honor
6966334 thanks to the initiative of our emergency management team the airport authority plans to engage entities throughout the airport community in addition to each of our neighboring communities through our outreach efforts to ensure our airports are the anchors of a greater community ready for all types of severe weather
6966335 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family
6966336 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6966337 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6966338 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6966339 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6966340 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6966341 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6966342 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6966343 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6966344 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6966345 our main mission is the freedom of kashmir nothing else we are not spreading terrorism there is no movement of terrorism in kashmir it is a freedom struggle a simple freedom struggle freedom from indian occupation
6966346 that is the main thing business is suffering about 75 percent of it has gone tourism is zero now i do not know how long it will last but for two months we are suffering
6966347 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6966348 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6966349 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
6966350 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
6966351 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6966352 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6966353 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6966354 we need to win a lot of games more than just the first one
6966355 it means nothing unless we come out and play well tomorrow we need wins whether its the beginning middle or end of the series
6966356 but i hope its not to be expected because i dont expect to keep doing that
6966357 mussina did a nice job of keeping us in the game baltimore has been tough on him but moose did a great job of limiting damage
6966358 santacroce merita la nazionale napoli sorpresa del campionato esordio a roma sar partita tirata
6966359 ho avuto modo di assistere solo ai primi minuti della gara contro la juventus ma devo dire che la squadra azzurra mi sembrata ben organizzata ed anche tonica sul piano fisico mi sono piaciuti molto gli esterni che aggredivano sempre i portatori di palla e quando hanno avuto la possibilit si sono proposti anche in fase offensiva diciamo che come test stato indicativo ma non fondamentale perch cerano molti giocatori assenti chi cera per non ha assolutamente demeritato
6966360 per poter competere su pi fronti nel calcio attuale bisogna disporre di una rosa molta ampia il napoli forse avrebbe bisogno di altri
6966361 sul risultato finale influir moltissimo la condizione fisica di entrambe le squadre chi avr pi minuti nelle gambre vincer ad inizio campionato i valori tecnici non contano tanto come ogni anno ci saranno risultati inaspettati alla prima giornata non trascurerei nemmeno il fattore ambientale perch far ancora molto caldo e questo incider ancora di pi sulla resistenza dei giocatori prevedo una partita tirata da ex calciatore di entrambe le squadre spero di assistere soltanto ad una festa di sport e non a scene di guerriglia urbana spero che i tifosi abbiano capito che lo sport fatto di passione non di odio
6966362 santacroce nonostante la sua et dimostra di avere gi il carisma necessario per imporsi in un gruppo di giocatori pi affermati sul piano tecnico rapido attento e sempre puntuale negli interventi credo che possa fare molto comodo alla nazionale anche perch capitan cannavaro gi avanti con let e santacroce potrebbe essere il suo erede ideale li vedrei benissimo anche in coppia insieme limpeto di santacroce e la classe di cannavaro sarebbe veramente una difesa invalicabile
6966363 quando arrivai in maglia azzurra la squadra era composta da molti stranieri e sul piano dei risultati la situazione gi era critica la squadra oramai gi navigava in brutte acque dopo laddio di mister mazzone lo spogliatoio si spacc ancora di pi e non ci fu pi modo di porre rimedio disputai solo poche partite tra cui una in coppa italia condita da un gol contro la lazio

6966383 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
6966384 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
6966385 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
6966386 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6966387 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces

6966404 you people really dont have any clue yet of the true heinousness of what ive done
6966405 i was not searching for a child but rather i was on a rampage
6966406 rape and kill until i was killed preferring death over capture
6966407 i was on a rampage i hated myself and i hated you
6966408 i knew the best way to hurt you was the way i was hurt an eye for an eye but the system didnt take my eye it took my heart and my innocence and i wanted to do the same to it
6966409 evidence consistently shows that i have been honest that i have been forthcoming
6966410 for some reason that changed and i think the evidence supports that also
6966411 i should thank them but i wont despite the heinousness of all my crimes and the sickness the insanity the evidence shows clearly that completely contrary to all my life experience that something happened
6966412 this is not for my own salvation but this is for yours and the hope of all of us together
6966413 happiness is making the most out of what you have

6966432 were working with our attorney about tightening up our ordinances to have people remove the stuff from their yards from the emerald ash borer the trees and the stumps
6966433 i agree 100 percent that a hazardous tree should come down
6966434 we have not exercised that authority for the emerald ash borer infestation to date all removed have been voluntary

6966438 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6966439 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6966440 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6966441 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6966442 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6966443 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6966444 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6966445 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6966446 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6966447 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6966448 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies

6966477 we are losing one of the best young boys in our community
6966478 it is heartbreaking i feel as though i lost my own child
6966479 this has happened in at least five stores in our community
6966480 the bulk of the conversation was about public safety and violence in their neighborhoods
6966481 if i had any of my own i would want them to be like him
6966482 until they catch him they have to be out here

6966491 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6966492 its about effort and guys having a desire to basically make the team for everybody no spots are written in stone especially with the team stats whereas when the season begins every one is written in pencil
6966493 bills always telling us the best players are going to play taking it further with the young guys its a sense of determination and a desire to refuse to be cut off of this team where youre going to go out there and every play youre going to show up on film thats what the preseason is about because youre not only auditioning to play with this team but with 31 other teams if this team doesnt want you

6966501 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6966502 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6966503 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6966504 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6966505 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6966506 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6966507 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6966508 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6966509 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6966510 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6966511 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6966512 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6966513 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6966514 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6966515 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6966516 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6966517 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6966518 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6966519 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6966520 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6966521 if you trust every web site but not a government
6966522 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6966523 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6966524 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6966525 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6966526 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6966527 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6966528 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6966529 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6966530 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6966531 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6966532 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6966533 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6966534 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6966536 they dont want to limit the scope of the kids they can reach
6966537 ggps locations are nationwide but they wanted to give as many options as they could to ensure that as many kids would take advantage of this as possible
6966538 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6966539 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6966540 it should be regulated all by weight and retailers shouldnt be allowed to play around with the numbers
6966541 it would have been changed by now if we could have gotten a telephone response
6966542 they normally work with people and theyre working very much against us
6966543 theres some tolerance between what youve labeled and what range it has to be in
6966544 its youre killing my business what can i do to hurt you thats the bottom line
6966545 no one was aware of anything like this happening before
6966546 the main focus of hotels and restaurants is sanitation and safety caloric content is not a mission and focus
6966547 and the outages that we did have were not very long because we had crews available to handle a much worse event so we were able to attack each situation very quickly
6966548 this was a serious event but not one with countywide devastation
6966549 this has been an excellent training exercise its given us a chance to tweak a number of things
6966550 i think we are going to see more limbs coming down and more wind and rain related problems before fay leaves us for good
6966551 weve got about 300 miles of dirt roads in our county
6966552 the road department did a lot of work to get the roads ready ahead of time still with this amount of rainfall it was only a matter of time
6966553 the real story for us wont start for a couple of days when we start seeing roads washed out

6966559 i would say its a pretty big trend across the nation and at the university of florida
6966560 in many ways the young people mirror what is happening to the electorate as a whole
6966561 even people who disagree with what were doing are still ready to register voters and bring people into the process
6966562 thats what happens when you bring 50 000 people with different backgrounds together
6966563 from the perspective of a 20 year old whether youre 47 or 71 youre still a heck of a lot older than we are
6966564 theyre more vocal now because they definitely have a chance to win

6966568 how many regular voters really care about some fat cats sitting in denver
6966569 you have people here who know the state it just makes sense to use them
6966570 it was a record turnout in a presidential preference primary that supposedly did not count

6966603 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6966604 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6966605 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6966606 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6966607 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6966608 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6966609 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6966610 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6966611 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6966612 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6966613 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6966614 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6966615 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view
6966616 they struggle and try to fight back to the very end even after their skin has been stripped off breathing heart beat directional body and eyelid movements were evident for five to 10 minutes
6966617 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6966618 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
6966619 nothing the great mystery placed in the land of the indian pleased the white man and nothing escaped his transforming hand
6966620 but because for the lakota there was no wilderness because nature was not dangerous but hospitable not forbidding but friendly lakota philosophy was healthy free from fear and dogmatism
6966621 in sharing in loving all and everything one people naturally found a due portion of the thing they sought while in fearing the other found need of conquest
6966622 for one man the world was full of beauty for the other it was a place of sin and ugliness to be endured until he went to another world there to become a creature of wings half man and half bird
6966623 forever one man directed his mystery to change the world he had made forever this man pleaded with him to chastise his wicked ones and forever he implored his god to send his light to earth small wonder this man could not understand the other
6966624 but the old lakota was wise he knew that mans heart away from nature becomes hard he knew that lack of respect for growing living things soon led to lack of respect for humans too so he kept his children close to natures softening influence

6966658 i love my country and i love my grandma but life is not really good i have a family here
6966659 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6966660 it happens and it never leads to a diplomatic crisis
6966661 isnt this excessive why is the government overreacting like this
6966662 tanya is part of our family and well help with anything no matter how hard it is
6966663 i need some fine wine and you you need to be nicer
6966664 nothin in the world can stop me from worryin bout that girl
6966665 they drink anyway but i dont think they need a ticket to drink any sooner it just starts the problems sooner
6966666 for parents you dont want to tell them to drink at 18 but they can go to war
6966667 at 16 they can drive a car and thats a lot of responsibility as parents you can teach them to be responsible with whatever actions they take
6966668 were actually encouraging high risk behaviors by not allowing it to be in the open
6966669 were the only developed country in the world that has the drinking age at 21
6966670 if they fear legal consequences theyre going to do everything in their power to hide it to drink it fast and theyre not going to call for help when they get in trouble
6966671 if the age is 18 i can legally talk to 18 20 year olds about the responsible way to drink
6966672 ive been around awhile and was around in the early 80s when congress signed that highway funding waiver and it was done with a lot of passion and good intentions but without a lot of serious debate
6966673 it is in some ways like a prohibition that just hasnt worked
6966674 we end up turning university staff members into keystone kops chasing around seeing whether 20 year olds have an empty beer can somewhere in their car
6966675 its terribly hard to police and the fact is that underage students are drinking
6966676 we talk to our students about this we have programs were not ducking the problem but its not working
6966677 if anything rao would probably favor seeing the drinking age increased not that hes advocating that
6966678 you put alcohol in the hands of people who are still youngsters and you only increase the kind of trouble they might get into
6966679 i have mixed emotions about it because im a high school teacher and a coach
6966680 with education i think the culture of binge drinking could be changed but id rather see it go to 19 first
6966681 if thats what he says he wants i suppose you should give it to him

6966693 to lead a nation you must first lead a line dance
6966694 im a little nervous an opening day kind of feeling
6966695 i would say the answer to that question as we speak
6966696 the overall picture right now is how i can help the team
6966697 the first thing i have to do is get back to where i know i can be but this is probably the lowest point ive had to deal with
6966698 i think ive kind of bottomed out but that doesnt mean i dont believe i can come back and be a legit starter for this club apparently theres work for me to focus on
6966699 the hit totals and what lefties are doing against me this year 315 batting average compared to 248 before this season pretty much reveal that you have to go from somewhere though and we have to go from here im prepared for that
6966700 ill have to use him well try to get him out there hopefully not in do or die situations
6966701 a plus pitch and its not a plus pitch right now when it flattens out its very hittable
6966702 right now you cant feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas
6966703 i dont feel good about going out there after what happened in texas because i know i have better stuff than that
6966704 but when i dont have anything to throw off my fastball im in trouble my slider has flattened out too many times its caused my whole game to be inconsistent
6966705 i just know what i need to get back to
6966706 it starts right now thats part of this task in my mind im still a legit starting pitcher in the big leagues i can go out there and be successful but i have to be consistently successful
6966707 i guess im just another part of this story this year thats been frustrating for a lot of people but if i can finish out on a positive note in whatever capacity thats what i want
6966708 that it was not a good performance he was real deliberate and methodical early and not very good theyve worked hard to slow him down but from what i heard it got a little too slow
6966709 after a couple of innings when he got in the form of a rhythm it got a little better the worst thing to do would be to panic and go against everything weve tried to do and replace nate with dontrelle

6966721 if i can come in and we can win the super bowl thatll mean more than anything thus far in my life up to this point
6966722 for us not to have been in the playoffs for a little bit of time now and for us to go straight to a super bowl my rookie year you cant ask for anything else
6966723 when youre a young guy and you have to go in the huddle with a veteran offensive line a veteran quarterback and the wide receivers thats motivation to be a young guy
6966724 you want to add your little bit of spice to it you dont want them to know youre a rookie and you want to have your own little swagger
6966725 i got my feet wet which is exactly what the preseason game is for
6966726 i think i went out there and played every down hard
6966727 how many carries you get you want to fine tune those you want to make sure you hit the landmarks and do everything youre supposed to do correctly
6966728 thats what im doing and then when the regular season comes around we spice things up a bit

6966736 non si pu affidare una ferrari ad un neo patentato si rischierebbe di uscire fuori strada alla prima curva cos per la gestione delle centrali nucleari se le affidiamo a dei raccomandati rischiamo il disastro se le affidiamo a tecnici qualificati non corriamo rischi
6966737 oggi sul nucleare sostiene zichichi c davvero una grande confusione culturale si parla sempre dei rischi ma ci si dimentica che dopo lincidente di chernobyl i cui reattori sono stati costruiti in maniera pessima e nulla hanno in comune con quelli moderni i tecnici che sostituirono coloro i quali provocarono lincidente sono riusciti a portare avanti senza problemi gli altri tre reattori rimasti in funzione
6966738 oggi possibile realizzare centrali sicure come pure seppellire in maniera assolutamente sicura le scorie un procedimento questultimo che molto pi economico della distruzione

6966745 it was not easy taking this step since politics like religion is something learned on the knee of ones parents and grandparents and like anything else inherited it is imbedded in ones own identity this makes leaving even harder but there will be some joy for me in my new status since i will be able to speak for myself and not as a member of a party that has sadly lost its way

6966828 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
6966829 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
6966830 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
6966831 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted

6966840 extremely disturbed that this project appears to have significantly damaged an important environmentally sensitive area
6966841 the property has been stripped of nearly all vegetation the property is relatively steep sloping and denudation of the vegetation compromises slope stability and soil conservation
6966842 further it appears that land adjoining the property but not owned by the developer earmarked for designation as a nature reserve has also been cleared of vegetation
6966843 had not been approved by that body and a stop notice had been served
6966844 we congratulate the dca for taking this action and look forward to the early and decisive enforcement of the stop order
6966845 this contravenes the management regime for the world heritage site
6966846 this development would further jeopardise the world heritage status of the pma particularly since it was allowed to proceed without approval the approach that seems to be used by some developers is to coerce the political directorate to go against the tenets of conservation agreed to for the pma and even to go contrary to the law

6966858 i know that there is still a lot more to come from veronica over the years especially since she is yet to claim an individual olympic 100 metres title i want her to know that jamaica thanks her immensely and we look forward to an exciting future with her involved in jamaican athletics she has done herself and her nation proud once again

6966862 democratic presidential candidate joseph r biden jr a u s senator from delaware was driven from the nomination battle after delivering without attribution passages from a speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock a barrage of subsidiary revelations by the press also contributed to bidens withdrawal a serious plagiarism incident involving biden during his law school years the senators boastful exaggerations of his academic record at a new hampshire campaign event and the discovery of other quotations in bidens speeches pilfered from past democratic politicians

6966869 manufacturers attempting to improve both operational and corporate performance should first examine the overall structure of their business processes as a general theme we find best in class manufacturers are most significantly differentiated from their competition by the incorporation of real time data into these processes specifically best in class manufacturers are more than twice as likely as laggard manufacturers to monitor exceptions on the plant floor in real time use real time data in production optimization processes and in using real time data for production release and control
6966870 to incorporate real time data into business processes many of the best in class are looking towards technology in fact 55 of the best in class are currently using automated spc statistical process control software which makes them 38 more likely than laggard manufacturers to be doing so

6967027 this one feels as good as any of them we got off to such a bad start they the red devils were cramming it down our throats early in the game we turned it over things werent going well
6967028 our kids they continue to surprise me they dont get down they continue to make plays they believe theyre going to win thats a good quality or trait to have on your team
6967029 we talked all week about bad things happening and bouncing back i went to philip after that second interception and said look bro you just have to play your game
6967030 when they fumble the ball you better get it if its an interception you better get your hands on it
6967031 maryvilles an excellent team theyre used to winning they make their own breaks their kids make plays theyre able to get third downs theyre able to run a trick play theyre able to do the things they do to beat that team you have to make those plays on friday nights
6967032 just one of them and theyre going to beat you 14 10 if they make all the plays theyre going to beat you 28 7
6967033 what if somebody got up and said you were a murderer
6967034 our innovative litigation was aimed at holding accountable the small percentage of gun dealers who break the law and it has worked
6967035 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
6967036 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
6967037 we had warned the government to target police and the army if it didnt stop operations against us in swat
6967038 shes called us mom and dad since she was eight years old
6967039 i love my country and i love my grandma but life is not really good i have a family here
6967040 as a party responsible for these kids we do not find ourselves in position to let them go here anymore
6967041 it happens and it never leads to a diplomatic crisis
6967042 isnt this excessive why is the government overreacting like this
6967043 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
6967044 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6967045 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6967046 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6967047 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6967048 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6967049 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6967050 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6967051 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6967052 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6967053 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6967054 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6967055 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
6967056 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
6967057 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go
6967058 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
6967059 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
6967060 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
6967061 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
6967062 omali what are you going to do when bush suspends the election and instates martial law and takes complete control over the us

6967066 i miss you editing things lets all try to make something by tuesday
6967067 stepchildren are less likely to succeed in our culture today
6967068 and we know that all things work together for good to those that love god to those who are the called according to while we can all agree that in most all circumstances it is best for children to be raised by both biological parents this isnt always possible
6967069 the ball kind of popped up and it was going forward so i tried my best to volley it because i knew the defense was dropping back
6967070 so i did my best to get my knee over the ball and strike it at the right place and it worked
6967071 given the circumstances that we were away to open at altitude with lots of nervous freshmen playing we can live with it but weve got a long way to go weve got a lot of work to do
6967072 all definitions of art are equally correct and equally incorrect
6967073 it is a very awkward situation for the country because our greatest achievement is also our biggest burden
6967074 there is pressure for change but many people refuse to accept that we need a new approach so soon
6967075 typically industrial countries deal with green problems when they are rich
6967076 we have to deal with them while we are still poor there is no model for us to follow
6967077 chinas pollution is worse the density of its population is greater and people do not protect themselves as well
6967078 so the studies are not definitive my assumption is that they will turn out to be conservative
6967079 no one really knew what was driving the economy which is why the predictions were so wrong
6967080 what i fear is that the trend is now basically irreversible
6967081 china is making decisions today that will affect its energy use for the next 30 or 40 years
6967082 unfortunately in some parts of the government the thinking is much more shortsighted
6967083 the main reason behind the continued deterioration of the environment is a mistaken view of what counts as political achievement
6967084 the crazy expansion of high polluting high energy industries has spawned special interests protected by local governments some businesses treat the natural resources that belong to all the people as their own private property
6967085 officials do not like to be lined up and told how they are not meeting the leaderships goals

6967087 diesel engines emit countless carbon nanoparticles into the air slipping through government regulation and vehicle filters a new simulation shows that these nanoparticles can get trapped in the lungs and
6967088 all definitions of art are equally correct and equally incorrect
6967089 a game needs element x or else it does not qualify as art
6967090 we ascribe beauty to that which is simple which has no superfluous parts which exactly answers its end which stands related to all things which is the mean of many extremes
6967091 science cannot go outside of the sphere of abstractions in this respect it is infinitely inferior to art which in its turn is peculiarly concerned also with general types and general situations but which incarnates them by an artifice of its own in forms which if they are not living in the sense of real life none the less excite in our imagination the memory and sentiment of life art in a certain sense individualizes the types and situations which it conceives by means of the individualities without flesh and bone and consequently permanent and immortal which it has the power to create it recalls to our minds the living real individualities which appear and disappear under our eyes art then is as it were the return of abstraction to life science on the contrary is the perpetual immolation of life fugitive temporary but real on the altar of eternal abstractions
6967092 the poets are almost always wrong about the facts thats because theyre not interested in the facts only the truth
6967093 poetry therefore is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history for poetry tends to express the universal history the particular by the universal i mean how a person of a certain type on occasion speak or act according to the law of probability or necessity and it is this universality at which poetry aim
6967094 homer is one of the men of genius who solve that fine problem of art the finest of all perhaps truly to depict humanity by the enlargement of man that is to generate the real in the ideal
6967095 who as mr pater suggests somewhere would exchange the curve of a single rose leaf for that formless intangible being which plato rates so high just as nature is matter struggling into mind so art is mind expressing itself under the conditions of matter and thus even in the lowliest of her manifestations she speaks to both sense and soul alike to the sthetic temperament the vague is always repellent
6967096 this suggests that the game is really a form of indirect communication i may want to tell you about some truth of the human condition but if i say it in conscious or explicit terms it will sound too academic too intellectual and you wont hear me but if i wrap my message up inside a game and let you experience its manifestations rather than its intrinsic nature those manifestations can penetrate your consciousness and work their way down deeper where the true message can be induced from the instantiations and understood
6967097 the dignity of the artist lies in his duty of keeping awake the sense of wonder in the world in this long vigil he often has to vary his methods of stimulation but in this long vigil he is also himself striving against a continual tendency to sleep
6967098 a book must be an axe for the frozen sea inside of us
6967099 the defining function of the artist is to cherish consciousness

6967105 as stewards of the history of mount prospect it is altogether fitting that we much like the ancients and in keeping with the earliest traditions of western civilization honor the accomplishments and traditions of the must sees of our time from this day forward
6967106 its gratifying to know that we live in a community that values its history and its institutions
6967107 i am very happy to be here to accept this honor on behalf of the 450 members of the church
6967108 im from chicago where the tradition is to vote early and often
6967109 seriously though this was such a clever idea for the historical society to hold this contest it was fun and hopefully people learned something about the village that they didnt know before they voted
6967110 the credit for keefers being one of the seven wonders goes to jerry and gerri
6967111 it all boils down to people liking to know who they are dealing with and if you are around long enough you get to know your customers
6967112 its not something you can package up it is the one on one service you get with a small town business
6967113 for years gordon brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst millions of people are paying an unfair price for labours economic incompetence and the fact the prime minister didnt put money aside during the good times to prepare for a rainy day
6967114 we now have official confirmation that the british economy has already reached the point of stagnation any further slowdown and well be in outright recession were now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6967115 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6967116 there is nowhere for the uk consumer to go but to continue to retrench real income growth has slumped as inflation accelerated while nominal pay growth remained subdued households can no longer resort to their borrow and spend habit
6967117 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6967118 im extremely gratified the board has the confidence in me to fulfill davids mission to help the college move forward

6967122 i look forward to helping to see plans for the future materialize
6967123 the games were great for athens but the cost was huge
6967124 greece is not a rich country and we had problems with things like health system and education system people ask whether it was worth it
6967125 they hadnt planned for the venues to be given for sport to the public to the youth and to the local sporting clubs
6967126 what seemed more important was their financial and commercial use
6967127 the cost was very big and the result was not what it should have been
6967128 perhaps what they do mind is that after the olympics we did not use the olympics as a springboard for the country
6967129 was it worth it could we have done more to exploit the olympics afterwards the answer is absolutely yes
6967130 we could have done more in terms of using the facilities more and using the feeling that it created in the country
6967131 i was sleeping when the attack on disa started i was taken away by the attackers they were all in uniforms they took dozens of other girls and made us walk for three hours during the day we were beaten and they were telling us you the black women we will exterminate you you have no god at night we were raped several times the arabs guarded us with arms and we were not given food for three days

6967133 tal como se se ala en las convocatorias los criterios son calidad y viabilidad
6967134 el cine colombiano es tan bueno que tanto realizadores j venes como con m s trayectoria hacen pel culas de gran calidad viabilidad

6967137 el cine colombiano 2006 est al lado del m s d bil para hundirlo en su debilidad del pobre para condenarlo en su pobreza del feo para burlarse de l y del ma para que se lo goce el de buen gusto por tanto este cine es a pesar de s mismo est ticamente d bil pobre feo y ma y pol ticamente muy cuestionable

6967139 la mayor a de los cineastas nacionales no toleran que alguien les haga caer en cuenta de sus errores y siempre enarbolan la bandera del enorme esfuerzo que cost realizar una pel cula
6967140 abogamos por que por lo menos desde la pol tica p blica y desde la convicci n personal de algunos creadores esa desmesura mercantilista que trafica con los sue os las expectativas los deseos y la ingenuidad de los espectadores tenga un contrapeso
6967141 lamentablemente se ha extendido la creencia de que el p blico est masivamente infantilizado cuando la verdad es que si lo est es precisamente porque se le proh ben de hecho otras alternativas

6967149 por qu en promedio usted y yo nos acabamos de comer un pollo cada uno
6967150 para un an lisis m s comprensivo deben analizarse las cifras caso por caso
6967151 lo que estas cifras quieren decir es que el gran xito me siento tentado a deir que el nico xito pero esto ignorar a la valoraci n est tica de las pel culas del cine colombiano bajo la ley de cine ha sido tener en 2005 y 2006 sendas pel culas de m s de un mill n de espectadores sin las cuales la situaci n es bastante mediocre 5

6967250 we sold the surplus new make spirit to independent bottlers to store and bottle in their own time under their own label
6967251 the majority of our drinkers who look for consistent character and quality
6967252 its a sign of the times that major distillers are no longer willing to sell casks to the independents for private bottling
6967253 i believe the multinationals will slowly squeeze the lifeblood out of the independents
6967254 as distillers recognize the importance of their single malt brands
6967255 to protect their brand equity and control the quality of the final product
6967256 if they offer a below standard single malt it immediately has a negative effect as the product will be associated by the specialiced retailer and the consumer with all of the company s single malts which in the end can drive the company out of the market

6967274 i paid little attention to the advice given to me by my professors
6967275 saya diuji allah dengan cacat kaki ini seumur hidup saya
6967276 saya lahir dalam keadaan seperti ini mungkin banyak orang akan pesimis mengha dapi keadaan yang demikian tetapi sejak kecil saya telah memohon sesuatu pada allah saya berdoa agar saat orang lain melihat saya tak ada yang diingat dan disebutnya kecuali allah
6967277 ya agar mereka ingat allah saat menatap saya itu saja
6967278 di antara mereka ada yang membawakan sebelah tongkat saya ada yang memapah ada juga yang menunggu di atas
6967279 saya bahagia karena mereka menyebut nama allah bahkan ketika saya berhasil menamatkan kuliah keluarga kerabat atau teman kembali memuji allah alhamdulillah allah memang maha besar begitu kata mereka
6967280 kita tahu terkadang orang normal pun susah mendapatkan jodoh apalagi seorang yang cacat seperti saya ya tawakal saja
6967281 dan lagi lagi saat walimah saya dengar banyak orang menyebut nyebut nama allah dengan takjub allah itu maha kuasa ya maha adil masya allah alhamdulillah dan sebagainya
6967282 lalu saat saya hamil hampir semua yang bertemu saya bahkan orang yang tak men genal saya menatap takjub seraya lagi lagi mengagungkan asma allah ketika saya hamil besar banyak orang menyarankan agar saya tidak ke bidan melainkan ke dokter untuk operasi bagaimana pun saat seorang ibu melahirkan otot otot panggul dan kaki sangat berperan namun saya pasrah saya merasa tak ada masalah dan yakin bila allah berkehendak semua akan menjadi mudah dan alhamdulillah saya melahirkan lancar dibantu bidan
6967283 subhanallah maha besar engkau ya robbi yang telah memberi pelajaran pada saya dari pertemuan dengan hambamu ini kekalkanlah persaudaraan kami di sabilillah selamanya amin

6967286 i just want to get back into the swing of things where i feel comfortable and its not a big deal when i go through a game and do something well
6967287 i just want to contribute to whats going on here its awesome
6967288 taking some time off isnt always the easiest thing to do but i feel like im able to do it ok and not lose my swing by taking days off
6967289 one thing i talked about before the game is we cant do two things walk people and commit errors because of their propensity to hit home runs
6967290 we got away with it tonight but you cant expect to do that all the time we were fortunate
6967291 in the second or third inning i told the guys tonight was the epitome of being effectively wild
6967292 i was getting away with some stuff i was missing my spots
6967293 thats kind of a weird feeling about the situation here in chicago
6967294 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox
6967295 what happens to people when they hang out with the band
6967296 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
6967297 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
6967298 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
6967299 i am delighted it will prove the whole thing is a charade
6967300 we did absolutely nothing wrong and the allegations will be proven entirely false
6967301 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area

6967308 side projects are less masturbatory than reading rss often more useful than mobileme and usually more fun than listening to keynotes
6967309 they can be a thought leader a convener a driver of national strategy an exhorter to industry
6967310 our ideas our music our books our movies our innovations are just as precious as any tangible property
6967311 with new technologies coming out at warp speed this global problem will only get worse
6967312 but if they want to get immunity they have to confirm an espionage relationship
6967313 they have to waive the state secrets privilege to get to immunity
6967314 only god helped us survive these four nights of hell and suffering
6967315 all this time i prayed and god heard me i and all those who hid here remained alive it is a miracle that this building remained standing
6967316 after what happened after what we lived through we cannot forgive this right away
6967317 ill agree to your terms if you answer a question
6967318 how will i know i hate performing below expectations jenna and after you took the time to look so absolutely
6967319 stunning i dont want to be a disappointment to you
6967320 arent you full of surprises i forgot that little detail about you i think youll find that i have a few of my own
6967321 you didnt tell me where you wanted me to kiss you
6967322 now now its more fun when i have to figure things out on my own
6967323 personally i would love to place a kiss right here
6967324 but i dont think thats what you had in mind with your request
6967325 this looks like it has potential but i think you would prefer something closer to here
6967326 here is this the spot professor should i test my hypothesis
6967327 hmm i dont think that was quite right will you give me another chance
6967328 thank you i promise ill get it right this time now i think i was close last time i was close wasnt i
6967329 i wouldnt want to be accused of being traditional but i would very much like to kiss your lips would you like that
6967330 if you get those individuals that fit the federal requirements it creates the american dream like no other program ive ever witnessed
6967331 whether it happens now or next year it will be a dream come true for these families
6967332 a house in galveston for this price would either be really old or rundown or have something wrong with it
6967333 being able to have a new house thats a decent size for us is really nice
6967334 its a way to get people to think and get insurance
6967335 its unfair for most of us having to buy insurance when we have so many that dont
6967336 when youre driving two tons of steel at 60 miles per hour down the road you really ought to have liability insurance its just not right for some people not to do that
6967337 i just want something good to come out of all this
6967338 thats got to be one of the most dangerous intersections in galveston county
6967339 he thinks the traffic is northbound so he turned left
6967340 this is the highest accident intersection on highway 146 in galveston county
6967341 you have to do a lot of groundwork before you can proceed its frustrating that a lot of people seem to think this is all a fun and game business and the city is out there trying to shut down bachelor parties
6967342 were talking about drugs and violent crime all next to a residential neighborhood
6967343 just when you think youre going to close one down theres always a loophole there
6967344 i get very frustrated by the stigma these businesses put on an area when better grocery stores or department stores will move out of a shopping center
6967345 im the first to tell you that i dont think the city should be shutting down businesses but the area where those businesses are located is a high crime spot
6967346 i get a lot of calls from homeowners closest to the businesses and they will always say that weve got to stop this we cant have it
6967347 when we go in there well say theyre operating without a license and then theyll say oh no were a bikini bar now
6967348 they can call themselves a bikini bar all day long im not sure what a bikini bar is but our officers are finding that all the topless clubs theyre operating the same
6967349 we can raid the same business every night and arrest the manager and they bond out of jail and its just a misdemeanor
6967350 basically the less money you have the less money you think you need to become rich the more money you have the more money you think you need
6967351 i think as you get more wealth you set the bar higher
6967352 to me someone who has a net worth of 10 million to 15 million probably doesnt have to work again as long as they dont go crazy
6967353 but most people who have a net worth of less than 15 million dont think of themselves as rich
6967354 but when i see 5 million i think wow thats going to be a great customer but i dont think whoo ee
6967355 if he did it it was because he was so beaten down he couldnt take the pain
6967356 i dont understand how you can go from making a mistake to losing your life im dumbfounded by it
6967357 there are two sides to every story and the truth is probably somewhere right in the middle
6967358 he was a feisty young fellow popular and wanted to learn english very much he wasnt timid he tried to use it
6967359 none of us know what this kid was thinking no one knows what pushed him to that regard
6967360 i really seriously feel for that family that is a void you just cant fill
6967361 he said tell them i love them and ive always tried to be a good son
6967362 unless zero tolerance is clearly and repeatedly conveyed from the top down the best federal prisoner rape elimination act policy will be little more than a paper facade
6967363 has a zero tolerance policy against sexual encounters of any kind within the prison system and recognizes the importance of educating offenders about sexual assault and abuse the safe prisons program is in operation at all tdcj correctional facilities including the five units specifically cited in this study
6967364 in a well managed prison you see low levels of sexual abuse in poorly managed prison youll see high levels of sexual abuse
6967365 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
6967366 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go
6967367 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
6967368 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
6967369 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
6967370 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
6967371 all of that type of equipment is available to anybody who wants to buy it
6967372 i cant see throwing them away if you can sell them for something
6967373 screw good i wanna do evil for the fun of it
6967374 and some people just want to watch the world burn
6967375 ive known bill for many years and i dont know of anybody else as strong as how can i put this bill is hmm is in my opinion the most influential sports person in this town
6967376 what hes done with the united states olympic committee and the national governing bodies and the support from el pomar to me bill is ahh you know bill is hes tops in my mind
6967377 he has been in a position to wield influence by virtue of his roles
6967378 but he has wielded it effectively into the huge benefit of all of the sports organizations in this town and its not just sports organizations it really extends all the way down into the entire populace
6967379 the fact of the matter is without bill hybl and his vision and support and commitment there is no colorado springs world arena there is no el pomar youth sports center and there are several ngbs who might not have had the wherewithal to be where they are or to have ever moved to colorado springs
6967380 bill hybl is known for huge contributions to our community and to the state of colorado
6967381 it was very nerve wracking in the first 10 minutes
6967382 beans goal helped a little bit it showed us we could play with a big school from a big conference
6967383 we were rough in spots and they were rough in spots
6967384 but when we were rough the effort didnt go down and our heads didnt go down we stayed in it
6967385 theyve been drilling it into our heads since day 1 it feels very natural out there
6967386 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6967387 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
6967388 voiced support for enda which would prohibit employment discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity
6967389 ive been to afghanistan ive been to iraq seven times ive been in the balkans ive been in these foxholes with these kids literally in bunkers with them let me tell you something nobody asked anybody else whether theyre gay in those foxholes our allies the british the french all our major allies gays openly serve i dont know the last time an american soldier said to a backup from a brit hey by the way let me check are you gay are you straight this is ridiculous
6967390 supports extending federal benefits rights privileges and responsibilities to same sex couples and their children provided the partnership meets certain federal standards of commitment and mutuality of interest
6967391 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
6967392 i was going into the prelim a little bit nervous and my first dives werent too good
6967393 but coming into the semi final i was hungry to get into the final and again my first dive wasnt so good but i slowly and surely made my way back
6967394 the fourth one is one of my favourite dives so it is normally my most consistent one
6967395 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
6967396 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6967397 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
6967398 theres things you know and theres things that you dont know and then theres things that you dont know that you dont know until you know them and once you know then you have a choice to make
6967399 hes very competitive at his jumps but sometimes he can take off too early
6967400 she put him in a spot where he wasnt too competitive and it worked out terrifically
6967401 i think hell make into a grand annual horse next year hopefully
6967402 i never thought id ride a winner in australia either
6967403 he hoplite settled really well and he knew what job he had to do he wasnt pulling on you
6967404 christianity is the only true religion jesus said that he was the only way jesus is unique he was either telling the truth or he was crazy or he was a liar but since everyone agrees that jesus was a good man how then could he be both good and crazy or good and a liar he had to be telling the truth he is the only way
6967405 preach the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
6967406 and i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of god
6967407 the world is equally shocked at hearing christianity criticized and seeing it practiced
6967408 many people think that the bible is the authentic word of god and they worship the bible making it an idol

6967647 its going to be exciting i was sitting here envisioning what it would look like with a hockey rink on the field
6967648 i know theyve played football here in the past its going to be special especially with me being from chicago getting to be a part of history
6967649 you dont want to hurt anybodys feelings ive found a new home with detroit but chicago is always going to be home and my parents are here
6967650 i intend on coming back here someday and living the rest of my days whether its as a player or just somehow maybe involved with the blackhawks
6967651 theyve got a great young nucleus with this team and the management with what theyve done is just tremendous for the fans
6967652 its been a long time coming since you felt that buzz i cant say i wish i was a part of it right now because im a red wing but its great to see the fans excited about blackhawks hockey
6967653 it is kind of keying in on our whole area down here
6967654 we will have to make a decision then as to whether or not we need to move people out of low lying areas
6967655 we will work with emergency management personnel and restore service to critical customers like hospitals sewer lift stations and police and fire stations as quickly as possible
6967656 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6967657 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
6967658 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
6967659 i just blew out my tire on my way to work and i dont have a car my friend is watching my daughter and gave me her car but she needs it back in 30 minutes so should i leave this with you until this afternoon or is it possible to fix it now

6967663 now i have a chance to go to denver and participate and possibly even vote for obama
6967664 most thought it was pretty exciting but some just glared at me when they heard it was the democratic convention
6967665 its phenomenal im just amazed at my good fortune in being able to partake in such a historic event im excited about the idea that we can have some change
6967666 im looking forward to seeing some of the political folks i always see on tv i would love to be able to sit down and talk with some of these people at length but ill probably be looking at them from afar but im bringing a camera as a matter of fact im bringing a couple of cameras

6967671 i see them both as equally qualified so i would have to support the one that represents our community the best and thats land capital

6967731 i believe that when a president goes way off course on something as important as iraq the single most effective way to get him to change course is to demonstrate that his policy has waning or no support from both parties
6967732 this resolution says what we democrats and republicans are against deepening americas military involvement in iraq by escalating our troop presence it also says what we are for a strategy that can produce a political solution to stop the violence
6967733 compelling description of the threat to america and to freedom from radical islamic fundamentalism

6967800 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
6967801 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
6967802 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
6967803 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
6967804 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
6967805 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
6967806 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
6967807 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
6967808 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
6967809 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
6967810 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
6967811 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
6967812 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
6967813 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later

6967854 nothing but dry food from now on i want to see ribs on this dog next time you bring it in

6967856 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6967857 both teams had agreed before the game to not play an overtime
6967858 the home team said they didnt want to do it for a preseason non conference game so there wasnt much we could do i wish we could have
6967859 we were sleep walking through the first half of the football game we warned them the players but i didnt do a good enough job preparing them to play
6967860 i played it like it was and did my assignment
6967861 i got to the flats read the quarterbacks eyes and watched for the option
6967862 it seemed like every time our backs were to the wall somebody stepped up and made a play
6967863 modern science has advanced since and this is an opportunity to apply modern science to evaluate these products
6967864 the attempt to delay democracy by this government is breathtaking this is a cynical attempt to muzzle the voice of new zealanders who are opposed to the hugely unpopular and highly flawed anti smacking law
6967865 the referenda held at the same time as the 1999 general election caused confusion congestion in polling places and significantly delayed the preliminary results and the chief electoral officer has advised me the same problems would occur this year if the referendum was held at the same time as the general election
6967866 i probably got about a litre of spew taken out of me but i should be able to replenish and get some energy back
6967867 i just think about what ive done in the past how many years ive put into the sport and i just really want it

6967876 ive never had that many strikeouts in any season its cool everything was going well everything felt good
6967877 at this stage of the season to have 200 strikeouts that tells you what incredible stuff he has whats been impressive is how hes emerged as a pitcher too he can throw any pitch any time
6967878 he just doesnt miss very often over the plate and when he does its going 95 mph
6967879 its different to have success against him you basically have to wait for him to make a mistake
6967880 baek pitched a solid game but they didnt miss a mistake in the fourth inning
6967881 bengie hit it well and the home run was the death blow
6967882 i would have been ok with going out there but there are other guys for that situation
6967883 they dont need to throw me out there if they dont want to id love to get a complete game in there but if i dont im still just trying to do my job and give them what i can while im out there

6967890 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming since the industrial revolution
6967891 to base environmental policy on sound science rather than exaggerated fears
6967892 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6967893 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6967894 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6967895 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6967896 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6967897 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming since the industrial revolution
6967898 to base environmental policy on sound science rather than exaggerated fears
6967899 the ipcc is a single interest organization whose charter directs it to assume that there is a human influence on climate rather than to consider whether the influence may be negligible
6967900 more than two thirds of all authors of chapter 9 of the ipccs 2007 climate science assessment are part of a clique whose members have co authored papers with each other and we can surmise very possibly at times acted as peer reviewers for each others work
6967901 it is no surprise therefore that the majority of scientists who are skeptical of a human influence on climate significant enough to be damaging were unrepresented in the authorship of chapter 9 most of whose authors were climate modelers unwilling to admit that their models are neither accurate nor complete
6967902 this network of relationships between most of the authors of chapter 9 demonstrates a disturbingly tight network of scientists with common research interests and opinions the contrast between this close knit network and the ipccs stated claim to represent a global diversity of views is remarkable and does not augur well for the impartiality or reliability of chapter 9s conclusions
6967903 governments have naively and unwisely accepted the claims of a human influence on global temperatures made by a close knit clique of a few dozen scientists many of them climate modelers as if such claims were representative of the opinion of the wider scientific community on the evidence presented here the ipccs selection of its chapter authors is so prejudiced towards a predetermined outcome that its entire process is valueless its scientific assessment of the climate meaningless and its conclusions useless
6967904 the mclean analysis of the processes of the ipcc 4th assessment report supports prior criticisms of ipcc processes and results
6967905 we now have a better understanding of how the ipcc 3rd assessment report hockey stick fiasco in which bogus statistical data was presented to support a nonexistent warming record was allowed to occur
6967906 that is to say the uns ipcc is a political organization feigning science as a cover for its political ends
6967907 the uns careful selection of layers of like minded authors for the critical chapter 9 shows it quite successfully counted on a small clique of authors avoiding any meaningful peer review of their assertions
6967908 they should probably be introducing a tax for energy waste if you want to knock a building down if you want to waste that energy then you have to make a payment for it
6967909 if we suddenly introduce significant increased costs on new homes that will actually drive houses to an unaffordable level and that will actually lock another generation out so we actually have to look at this in a holistic sense
6967910 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
6967911 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
6967912 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
6967913 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
6967914 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
6967915 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

6967923 militants attacked our team carrying out search operations in the area and killed three soldiers the fighting is still going on
6967924 i thought we competed well in the second half as a team i thought matt did a good job leading the team with the opportunities he had he hung in there
6967925 he took a few hits but he stepped up and threw the ball
6967926 we strung some good plays together but we still came up short
6967927 it wasnt good enough the drives werent perfect theres still a lot of room for improvement
6967928 its my responsibility to try and stay calm and recognize what theyre doing and run our offense
6967929 at times i thought we did a decent job at times i thought we came up short
6967930 we had some penalties we had to overcome and some mistakes but we kept on competing i think thats positive
6967931 they love me they miss me but im not with them so they hate me
6967932 everybody knows the situation about the patriots and how they handle business and keeping their players so its not nothing to talk about im not a guy thats going to keep controversy going life goes on
6967933 i always told him i cant wait to play against him so it was unfortunate we didnt get to see each other its all good its preseason so if youre not feeling good why come out
6967934 he made me get on my horses a little bit they got a pass interference call i dont know who they called it on but its good to go out there and compete a little bit
6967935 weve just got to get back to work on this as a unit we need to step up and make plays like we did last year we have the talent we have the athletes we have the experience theres no reason why that should happen
6967936 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of out kicked his coverage i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side and hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
6967937 you came to the right guy because that one was my fault
6967938 kickoffs are simple everyone has responsibilities obviously they base it on everyone giving effort thats a given and you better be giving it otherwise youre not going to be here
6967939 but youve also got to be right where they coach you to be i was trying to do too much i didnt get in the lane i needed to get in or hit the wedge in the position i need to
6967940 and it cost us a touchdown thats plain and simple
6967941 i can fix it i fixed it on the next one but you dont get re dos in this sport am i glad it happened now am i glad it happened now instead of two weeks from now of course but thats just one area where i need to get better
6967942 we take a lot of pride in our special teams especially our kickoff because the way you cover kicks kind of really sets the tone theres just no way we can have returns going back on us putting our defense in a difficult situation and our team in a difficult situation

6967969 in fact three quarters of those who have poca accounts already have building society or bank accounts so they may already be making savings by paying their bills by direct debit but poca is only available to people who are on benefits and we want to help people off benefits and into work and we believe having a bank account is an integral part of being ready for work since 1996 we have helped over 4 million households out of fuel poverty not least by the winter fuel payment which the conservatives opposed

6968004 whats the big deal she did get the cards and some cash

6968006 now dont try escaping this one with your eh if i remember correctly you made me get miki a shopping spree after your first ehem with her
6968007 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6968008 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night

6968016 ayumi paused she didnt know how to complete the sentence actually she didnt even know what she wanted to drive at with this conversation

6968040 ok so sorry that i wasnt that totally hilariously over joyed about that you have a gf or at least are inlove with one
6968041 you have to do a lot of groundwork before you can proceed its frustrating that a lot of people seem to think this is all a fun and game business and the city is out there trying to shut down bachelor parties
6968042 were talking about drugs and violent crime all next to a residential neighborhood
6968043 just when you think youre going to close one down theres always a loophole there
6968044 i get very frustrated by the stigma these businesses put on an area when better grocery stores or department stores will move out of a shopping center
6968045 im the first to tell you that i dont think the city should be shutting down businesses but the area where those businesses are located is a high crime spot
6968046 i get a lot of calls from homeowners closest to the businesses and they will always say that weve got to stop this we cant have it
6968047 when we go in there well say theyre operating without a license and then theyll say oh no were a bikini bar now
6968048 they can call themselves a bikini bar all day long im not sure what a bikini bar is but our officers are finding that all the topless clubs theyre operating the same
6968049 we can raid the same business every night and arrest the manager and they bond out of jail and its just a misdemeanor
6968050 basically the less money you have the less money you think you need to become rich the more money you have the more money you think you need
6968051 i think as you get more wealth you set the bar higher
6968052 to me someone who has a net worth of 10 million to 15 million probably doesnt have to work again as long as they dont go crazy
6968053 but most people who have a net worth of less than 15 million dont think of themselves as rich

6968085 to have great britain come second and seventh is just amazing i was going for it in the run but i realised it wasnt going to happen
6968086 in the end keeping ahead of third was my biggest worry so it was quite a relief to get second
6968087 it was great fun ive had a brilliant time all day and to come second makes it even better its been amazing to compete in front of so many people
6968088 i cant complain with seventh my fence was quite average today but the other four events went well and i had a personal best in the swim

6968097 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
6968098 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
6968099 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

6968107 muslims who want to live under islamic law should get out of the country
6968108 to make these kind of comments against a group of people who are so loving and so caring i was very very offended by that
6968109 we need to go together forward not by spreading hate but by understanding and building bridges
6968110 we need to go together forward not by spreading hate but by understanding and building bridges
6968111 the bush administration and the public have paid too little attention to a series of russian challenges to the stability of europe if there is a russian veto in the security council or an effort to water down or delay ahtisaaris plan the fragile peace in kosovo will evaporate within days and a new wave of violence possibly even another war will erupt
6968112 moscow s point about protecting fraternal slav serb feelings is nonsense everyone who has dealt with the russians on the balkans as i did for several years knows that their leadership has no feelings whatsoever for the serbs
6968113 we hope for assimilation of muslim immigrants while we work at reducing immigration and prepare ourselves for soft islamicization
6968114 the ghost in the machine in january 2008 that focused on cyberwarfare and chinas system the

6968117 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
6968118 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
6968119 thats because last summer we took a proactive stance knowing that the sky was going to darken
6968120 so the district will have a 3 4 million pad heading into the next year

6968125 they loved money all of them watching out for themselves
6968126 they the girls lived with him after his divorce from rielles mom
6968127 i know their father was giving some of them money for a long time
6968128 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
6968129 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
6968130 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
6968131 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
6968132 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
6968133 what she described as units and what we would call cells
6968134 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
6968135 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island
6968136 but also serve a larger strategic goal that of boosting the economies which now produce large pools of unemployed embittered youth
6968137 the initiative deceptively reads like its supporting all alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy sources
6968138 but a closer read finds a laundry list of cash grabs much of the measures billions could benefit pickens company to the exclusion of almost all other clean vehicle fuels and technology
6968139 even worse private trucking and delivery companies could buy 5 000 natural gas trucks collect california taxpayer funded rebates of 200 million or more and immediately send those fleets out of state
6968140 its like asking california voters to finance a new bridge with taxpayer dollars without mentioning that the bridge could be in ohio
6968141 it is hard to tell if the water scheme is the device being used to seize the land or if the wind turbine scheme is the means by which he will fund the water scheme
6968142 no matter what the case may be nancy pelosi will personally profit from whatever pickens does as an investor
6968143 while the stock was initially offered at 14 and is now valued below that amount the low of 10 in early july of this year is bouncing back
6968144 especially in light of ads by pickens and growing consensus that the pickens plan will gain support especially if pelosi is firmly behind it
6968145 we got an automatic green light to go through mexican customs and then we were blindfolded and taken to a house in tijuana they held a pistol to my stomach all the time we were in the car
6968146 transnational kidnappings are a new way of operating for these criminal groups mainly in california and so we are seeking collaboration with the united states
6968147 we have seen an increase in the number of kidnappings of u s citizens in tijuana including cross border abductions
6968148 the break up of the arellano felix organization has not been as complete as we would have wished they have moved into other activities such as kidnapping
6968149 why have there been no terrorist attacks in the us since 9 11 2001
6968150 the actors motivations may be unclear and therefore difficult to label as terrorism
6968151 implores allah to give jews and their enablers likely the us a black day
6968152 follow in the footsteps of one of my role models mohammad atta one of the 9 11 hijackers
6968153 avenge the deaths or murders of muslims around the world
6968154 im upset at your foreign policy these are jews and i am tired of getting pushed around and our people getting pushed around by the situation in the middle east
6968155 this was not a fair fight and it was never going to be a fair fight
6968156 the last temptation of christ based on the novel by greek author nikos kazantzakis
6968157 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
6968158 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6968159 could prove to be a declaration of war a national security issue much worse than the violence proved by the
6968160 i walked through a metal detector to see last temptation of christ i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
6968161 sacred history turned into soft core pornography to be obnoxious and appalling but would they riot destroy property kill and boycott well boycott is the choice that most westerners would make and those that did the others would promptly be put in jail
6968162 it has no regrets about pulling out of publication of the jewel of medina despite the growing controversy about the decision
6968163 it was a difficult decision one that we have seldom had to take before and one that we hope not to have to take again
6968164 i just think publishers should uphold the principle of free speech editorial judgement is very important but free speech is sacred without it we should give up and go home
6968165 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
6968166 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
6968167 help spanish speaking students learn english while providing english speaking students with an opportunity to start learning spanish at an early age
6968168 its not just learning to speak another language but to have them literate in both languages
6968169 they are very helpful for those kids in teaching them a new language
6968170 theyre not helpful for the mostly spanish kids stuck in those programs and basically used as tools for helping these english speaking kids to learn another language
6968171 we have not seen that problem with the dual language program that it impedes the learning of the two languages simultaneously because that is happening here
6968172 its been very successful and our test scores will show that
6968173 ceo focuses on three areas in particular racial preferences immigration and assimilation and multicultural education
6968174 supports colorblind public policies and seeks to block the expansion of racial preferences and to prevent their use in employment education and voting
6968175 with the united states admitting high numbers of immigrants americas ability to accept newcomers will increasingly depend upon finding a pro assimilation middle ground between nativists who say that todays immigrants cannot assimilate and multiculturalists who say that they should not
6968176 promotes the assimilation of immigrants into our society and research on their economic and social impact on the united states
6968177 multiculturalists have a firm grip on both elementary and secondary schools and the universities their ideology of racial and ethnic difference risks balkanizing our multiracial society students who dont speak english are locked away in special programs that try to maintain native languages rather than teach english often without their parents consent in many urban schools african american students are fed a racialist afrocentric curriculum of dubious merit
6968178 the use of both spanish and english in the classroom is confusing him
6968179 why would we require parents unfamiliar with our educational system to make such a monumental decision when we are trained to make those decisions
6968180 not to encourage minority parents to switch to english in the home but to encourage them to strongly promote development of the primary language
6968181 excessive use of english in bilingual classrooms tends to lower students achievement in english
6968182 the border for many is nonexistent for me for intellectual reasons that border shall be nonexistent
6968183 how can anyone learn english in school when they speak spanish 4 1 2 hours a day
6968184 in more than seven years experience with bilingual education ive never seen it done successfully
6968185 i felt that i was deliberately holding back the learning of english
6968186 ninety one percent of scientifically valid studies show bilingual education to be no better or actually worse than doing nothing
6968187 i stood out of respect when the mexican anthem was played
6968188 but i think we should just sing the u s anthem my father who was born in mexico taught me that the united states not mexico is my country
6968189 pushing president mikheil saakshvili to perform an attack destined to weaken the kremlin
6968190 putin offensive to expand russian power southbound after years of weakness
6968191 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6968192 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
6968193 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
6968194 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
6968195 there is no escaping the unfortunate fact that muslim government employees in law enforcement the military and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to terrorism

6968209 every year in the past the indian side used to do at least some maintenance work but this year they did not carry out the repairs
6968210 this was the main reason why the koshi breached the embankment and submerged about 10 000 hectares of cultivated land and villages
6968211 but this year they did not contact the doi regional office
6968212 nazis were not full of hatred or genocide im sure you knew that

6968226 melissa dont let your mouth overload your hardware sit tight and serve your community fairly the real diarrhea is the way you want that committee to be more than what it is settle down and do your civic duty and maybe later you can serve on a board with real teeth that makes real changes for brownsville
6968227 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6968228 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
6968229 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
6968230 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6968231 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
6968232 innocently martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
6968233 all efforts by the government to seek the prevention of civilian casualties have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations
6968234 hi im a letter from the county of riverside telling you that one of the healthcare facilities you recently visited had a patient that has tuberculosis and youve possibly been exposed heres an 800 to call to schedule a test
6968235 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
6968236 had any of us known what was just ahead perhaps we would have been able to intervene before things went into crisis i wanted to be available to todd if he needed advice i had no agenda other than to see what was happening in lakeland continue and to see todd nurture this revival successfully i wish i had known that he was struggling in his marriage but unfortunately i did not
6968237 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6968238 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6968239 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6968240 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6968241 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6968242 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6968243 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6968244 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6968245 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6968246 would likely murder men simply because they appeared to be latino or african american
6968247 when a city is violating federal law and that violation of law leads to horrific consequences like this then the city has clearly acted in a negligent manner
6968248 a dog that is happy loving and easily bonds with people hes trying to run but still does not have full use of his left back leg where he had a fracture involving his hip joint
6968249 this case stands out because of the extreme violence and cruelty

6968257 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6968258 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6968259 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6968260 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

6968265 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6968266 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6968267 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6968268 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6968269 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6968270 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6968271 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6968272 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6968273 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6968274 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6968275 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6968276 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6968277 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6968281 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6968282 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6968283 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6968284 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6968285 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6968286 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6968287 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6968288 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6968289 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6968290 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6968291 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6968292 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6968293 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6968294 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6968295 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6968296 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6968297 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6968298 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6968299 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6968300 it is with much regret that the hays galleria oyster amp seafood fair for september 2008 has been cancelled
6968301 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
6968302 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
6968303 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
6968304 i am delighted it will prove the whole thing is a charade
6968305 we did absolutely nothing wrong and the allegations will be proven entirely false
6968306 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6968307 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6968308 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6968309 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6968310 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6968311 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6968312 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6968313 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6968314 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6968315 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6968316 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6968317 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6968318 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6968319 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6968320 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6968321 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6968322 a lot of people are still under the rubble we have recovered eight bodies
6968323 were in discussion with a few organizations and affliction is one of them
6968324 they are at the top of our list as far as drew is concerned hes made a great turnaround with his life and training he is ready to move forward
6968325 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6968326 i would never pay that much for something like that
6968327 quiero a alguien capaz de retar mis ideas y no simplemente a alguien que diga que s a todo
6968328 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6968329 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6968330 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6968331 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6968332 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6968333 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6968334 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6968335 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6968336 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6968337 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6968338 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6968339 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6968340 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6968341 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6968342 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6968343 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6968344 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6968345 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6968346 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6968347 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
6968348 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6968349 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6968350 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6968351 in delaware the largest growth of population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
6968352 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6968353 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6968354 much of the increase is attributable to the significant number of people entering and re entering the labor force which could be a sign that workers believe jobs are out there and they are actively looking
6968355 weve definitely seen an increase in people coming in looking for work with little or no work experience in recent years because theyve been at home with their kids
6968356 were just seeing a number of road bumps in front of the economy right now
6968357 i still dont believe were going through any watershed change in the local or national economy but these individual shocks are adding up

6968370 well he knows his stuff pretty well it may not be his absolute strongest point but he sure knows a lot more about economics than mccain does but he has this tendency which i worried about even a year ago to say lets put partisan divisions of the past behind us and then talk about economics as if both parties have made mistakes and its time to move forward hes been reluctant to drive home this message that republicans now have a long track record of really screwing up the economy and democrats do much better in his big economy speech on august 1 he seemed to go out of his way to avoid pointing out that the bad times were when republicans were in office and the good times were when democrats were in office hopefully hell get over that
6968371 well i hope so this economy issue is as ready made as you can imagine and this has happened in the past gore made a huge comeback when he started emphasizing these economic issues and that was at a time in 2000 when there was a kind of assumption that prosperity was here to say and that it really didnt matter who was in the white house so theres tremendous opportunity now to highlight those differences but its not just a matter of sniping of saying that phil gramm is still advising mccain its driving home that we have now got decades of experience that the policies of the right wing the policies that mccain has endorsed dont work for working americans
6968372 sure and there are multiple models here al gore did it and again that helped him a lot not quite enough but a lot bill clinton if we could just find some way of having barack obama give bill clintons acceptance speech to the 1992 democratic convention that was a terrific speech it was full of very simple language saying look under these guys the operators the wheeler dealers have prospered while ordinary people who are trying to make a living have done very badly and we can change that i dont think the public cares much about the 15 point policy proposals although people like me care but you need to make the simple point that it really matters who is in the white house and that people with an r after their name have been bad for workers
6968373 well heres what we know according to one of my colleagues larry bartels in the politics department working americans really do vastly better under democratic administrations its a little bit of a puzzle for economists who want to be able to be shown the policy tools that make that happen and we can only get at some of it but the historical facts show that it makes a big difference then there are a lot of things that are mostly under the radar like whos appointed to the national labor relations board what kinds of decisions are made about workers rights and bargaining how is union organizing treated you know if we got the employee free choice act which is something obama is supporting and that mccain is dead set against that can make a huge difference
6968374 yeah it could make a major comeback im not especially wal mart is the root of all evil but its a giant corporation that is un unionized and it could be unionized and that in itself would tilt the bargaining position of labor in america theres a huge difference between canada and the united states on unions theres this country up north they even speak the same language eh and yet they preserve a strong union movement its a political thing that weve become a country in which labor is so weak
6968375 there are several things we can do first of all healthcare we can assure every american affordable healthcare every other advanced country does it its a uniquely american thing not to we have a level of brutality and risk in there that nobody else has and its something that can be solved within a year given sixty seats in the senate and a democratic president willing to do it you know bill clinton was a president who had a hostile congress for 6 of his 8 years and even so labor did a whole lot better workers did a whole lot better during those 8 years than they did during the republican administrations on either side give us a democratic president with a progressive agenda and congress on his side and you may be amazed by what can happen
6968376 i think people are prepared to be smarter on this but mccains repetition of big untrue statements has to be countered by obamas repetition of big true statements you know hes got to be on message hes got to be punching
6968377 yes although for what its worth its not as bad this time around as it was in 2000 there actually have been more news stories pointing out that these things dont add up maybe ive just had my standards debased but while the coverage is pretty bad its not as bad as it was in 2000
6968378 oh look when i was hired by the times the idea was that id be writing about you know business deals and financial crises and scandals in other countries because america was a sensible solid place and i could just go back to doing what i thought i was going to be doing then
6968379 well i think that paul krugman is right on this is a moment for this message americans are suffering theyre fearful theyre anxious and obama has not been the most populist candidate in the primaries john edwards drove the populist issues and then hillary clinton did as well whats interesting is that in the last 48 hours obama is back on message and its a hillary message its like im fighting for you its not the sweeping change message because for many people in ohio and pennsylvania change sometimes means a factory closed a job lost so i think theres an opening millions of americans want a more active government on their side and john mccain offers more of the same the corporate economic trade agenda thats devastating the middle class
6968380 the conventional wisdom among democrats at least has always been that if you take a populist message out on the campaign trail you leave yourself open to the charge of class warfare bizarrely enough
6968381 he does have a problem here and its that angry young black man aggressively going after old white guy is going to send shivers through the viscera of a lot of particularly older white voters i would suggest that barack obama needs to hire a couple of good comedy writers because the way to go after mccain and mccain is a target rich environment as weve seen that over the last few weeks is with humor he did it with the housing thing made fun of the guy mccains incoherent much of the time make fun of that but obama cant be too aggressive
6968382 anybody who was worried doesnt need to be worried about this film i cant talk about it was in very capable hands the director did a phenomenal job the director and his crew
6968383 the guy who plays the lead is an instant star that dude is going to be so famous he is so wonderful he picked up a role that i would say is pretty challenging for somebody to step into the shoes of because it is a role that has been played before many times by the same guy
6968384 i would not like to be the guy in the case of something like star trek it would take a really insanely talented filmmaker like storyteller like in the case of star trek j j abrams so leave it to the people who are best equipped for it i am just the guy who should be watching those movies
6968385 it wasnt until very recently that it really hit me how cool that was working with nimoy there was so much work to do during the shoot and there were so many fires that needed putting out that there wasnt much time to sit and acknowledge the reality of working with him then the other day i was watching the movie and there he was there was spock and it hit me like holy s t it was kind of like a huge delay
6968386 i think this movie is going to be worth the wait its blessed with a wonderful optimism and an incredibly alive and invested cast while the visual effects are gonna be unbelievable the movie is working right now with only fifty of our thousand plus visual effects finished its funny its scary its dramatic emotional and entertaining all without having the stuff youd think a movie called star trek would require that to me is exciting
6968387 a snake takes one look at me and it will go away
6968388 i built this house every brick and every block and every nail i hate to see this

6968392 i share the interest and anxiety of many hoosiers who would love to see evan bayh on the ticket
6968393 i think it could make it a blue state in november
6968394 in indiana hes a favorite son hes an administrator he has been the ceo of the state of indiana he governed without tax increases jobs grew and he showed hoosiers he could govern and i think hes very very much a midwesterner

6968412 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6968413 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6968414 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6968415 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

6968423 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6968424 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6968425 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6968426 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6968427 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6968428 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6968429 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6968430 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6968431 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6968432 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6968433 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6968434 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6968435 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6968436 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6968437 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6968438 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6968439 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6968440 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6968441 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6968442 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6968443 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6968444 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6968445 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6968446 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6968447 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6968448 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6968449 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6968450 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6968451 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6968452 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6968453 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6968454 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6968455 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6968456 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6968457 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6968458 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6968459 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6968460 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6968461 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6968462 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6968463 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6968464 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6968465 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6968466 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6968467 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6968468 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6968469 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6968470 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6968471 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6968472 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6968473 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6968474 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6968475 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6968476 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6968477 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6968478 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6968479 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6968480 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6968481 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6968482 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6968483 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6968484 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6968485 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6968486 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6968487 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6968488 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6968489 we are here so that the world will know the truth
6968490 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6968491 there are cases of putting on fire houses by the georgian special command
6968492 that is their word as you know georgians are very good at provocations
6968493 the georgians or anyone who would do this are not human
6968494 i only have one favor to ask everyone who comes here
6968495 do not leave even one georgian kitten living among us because the day after it will become a tiger
6968496 after they blew everything up they shouted come out and raise your hands and we wont hurt you
6968497 this is for the heroes killed on their own land by the bloody aggressors
6968498 our battle for independence comes to its logical end before we thought we might have peaceful negotiation with the regime of georgia after august 8 it was clear this was impossible
6968499 can we live within the borders of georgia after what has happened
6968500 the people have to have at least some hope and thats what this is about

6968513 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6968514 were going to put up a lot of points and take the pressure off our defense were going to throw the ball a lot more this season which makes it fun
6968515 were a good combo and johnny times up his receivers and pulls the trigger
6968516 defense rose to the occasion and we didnt turn the ball over
6968517 johnny keeps progressing he sees the picture slower now when things happen quickly
6968518 defensively we played real well against a quarterback and team like that
6968519 in that third quarter our defense was on the field way too much but they hung in there
6968520 were not going to let them put their heads down we just ran out of time
6968521 the three easiest things to do are make excuses blame someone else or quit
6968522 it was a little weird last week in a scrimmage
6968523 but this week i felt a lot more comfortable and it was better
6968524 last year that was our problem we didnt play like a team it was just hard nosed football and we took it to them
6968525 it is going to be something were going to have to get used to
6968526 its going to be a few weeks for sure before he gets back were going to miss him but i think our kids rose to the occasion

6968534 i dont want to join any church or speak out for my beliefs because if i did i might have to recognize the things that i am doing that are wrong or sinful and then have to make changes in my life right now that i am not ready or willing to make
6968535 but realize this that in the last days difficult times will come for men will be lovers of self lovers of money boastful arrogant disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy unloving unforgiving malicious gossips without self control brutal haters of good treacherous reckless conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god holding to a form of godliness although they have denied its power always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
6968536 one of the better games weve played in the past three or four weeks
6968537 weve been struggling everybody knows it but were pulling together
6968538 he pitches quite a few games like that where we dont score a whole lot of runs seems like theyre always close games
6968539 im glad i made contact to get a hit is even better
6968540 the umpires got together to try to get it right thats all you can ask for if this thing replay comes along hopefully it can help out
6968541 i was just trying to get the bat on the ball
6968542 fortunately i got some good wood on it and it went out
6968543 i have no excuses for it just bad execution of pitches and leaving pitches that are way too good in the zone obviously a team like that can swing it a little bit
6968544 then i think my age caught up with me and i got a little tired in the last inning it just seemed like a lot culminated in that one inning
6968545 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6968546 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6968547 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6968548 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
6968549 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
6968550 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
6968551 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
6968552 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
6968553 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
6968554 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
6968555 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
6968556 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
6968557 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
6968558 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
6968559 taking turns edwards holds off busch to take his turn at the checkers
6968560 gossip is what no one claims to like but everyone enjoys
6968561 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6968562 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
6968563 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6968564 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6968565 if it is just empty promises like pm david thompson of barbados seems to be making then we shall have been betrayed by our leaders once again
6968566 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
6968567 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
6968568 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
6968569 i am delighted it will prove the whole thing is a charade
6968570 we did absolutely nothing wrong and the allegations will be proven entirely false

6968665 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6968666 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6968667 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6968668 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that

6968675 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6968676 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6968677 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6968678 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6968679 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6968680 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6968681 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6968682 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6968683 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6968684 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6968685 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6968686 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

6968688 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6968689 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6968690 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6968691 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6968692 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6968693 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6968694 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6968695 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6968696 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6968697 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6968698 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6968699 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6968700 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6968701 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6968702 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6968703 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6968704 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6968705 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6968706 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6968707 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6968708 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6968709 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6968710 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6968711 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6968712 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6968713 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6968714 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6968715 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6968716 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6968717 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6968718 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6968719 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6968720 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6968721 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6968722 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6968723 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6968724 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6968725 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6968726 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6968727 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6968728 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6968729 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6968730 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6968731 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6968732 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6968733 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6968734 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6968735 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6968736 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6968741 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6968742 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6968743 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6968744 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6968746 this is a planning took where all things are going
6968747 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6968748 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6968749 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6968750 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

6968752 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6968753 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6968754 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6968755 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6968756 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

6968765 obviously by calling your blog this fucking war you are among the ignorant and stupid people who dont stand behind our boys in uniform you are welcome to stand in front of them also the ignorance is seen in you have not studied the ancient manuscripts bible and nostradamas that say this war with radical islam will not end or go away until 2012 which is the end of the age and coming of jesus our rescuer since natural disasters which occur on a small scale once every 10 000 years and ended the reighn of the egyptians and happens every 100 000 years on a major scale which are both coiciding now study the ice core drillings radical islam is perpetuating a fight between ishmael arabs and issac the isrealites because they believe in such a jihad their messiah will return this battle between abrahams children over the inheritance because ismael was born first and sent into the desert and the inheritance of israel given to the issacs children will preclude armegheddon the only chance we have is totally destroying radical islam only cowards want to pull out and run nost bible ancient manuscripts which have all proven themselves extememly accurate are the basis for this information

6968771 oh ye of little faith who hath brought this evil upon our community good men have come to desire your belongings men of god have looked upon your evil prosperity and they want it for their own but just like the serpent in the garden of eden all that you truly offer my flock is damnation

6968773 no i wont denounce the things that i have built with my own two hands i denounce you i denounce whatever god would send a man in robes to kill innocent women and children i curse him and i curse you may the blood on your hands leave a stain that no soap can clean
6968774 i dont know what my family did to you or yours but i had nothing to do with it i denounced my familys name i moved away from here but you wouldnt let me escape it was you you wouldnt let me hate my blood for what they had done
6968775 no take me and leave my son out of this
6968776 i denounce your kind i declare humanity to be nothing more than pure evil on this night i curse every last one of you your blood will boil with the sins that you have committed

6968895 we are trying to understand how we have got a complicated world and we have an explanation in terms of a slightly simpler world and we explain that in terms of a slightly simpler world and it all hangs together down to an ultimately simple world
6968896 wat betreft de opmerking over spinozas filosofie als panthe sme door velen wordt die mening niet gedeeld panthe sme gaat samen met een personificatie van het godsbeeld die absoluut niet bij spinoza past
6968897 the very idea of religious tolerance is one of the principal forces driving us to the abyss

6968899 theologie handelt over de antropocentrische beleving van god en binnen het christendom ook over hoe de bijbel en jezus daarin tot ons spreken

6968902 we think it is important to find ways to go forward in a transparent fashion with india as they develop nuclear energy
6968903 its too important given the size of indias economy given the size of its nuclear infrastructure and its aspirations in nuclear generation we need to find a way to embrace them in bring them into the tent
6968904 we disagree on how to raise our daughter but we both agree something has to be done
6968905 no news is good news so lets get to todays weapon wednesday i found these weapons in green yellow ostrich skin sometime last month
6968906 but we would be remiss in our duty not have a plan in place in the event the situation did deteriorate
6968907 if however the airport at nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary
6968908 we would work with whatever government was in place in fiji to try to get their concurrence

6968917 ik werd seksueel opgewonden van mijn dochter als ze bij mij op schoot kroop dat is niet raar dat kan iedere man gebeuren ik had haar echter van mijn schoot moeten halen in het begin deed ik dat maar daarna kon ik me niet meer verzetten
6968918 ik haat mijn leven en mijn lichaam de bescherming die ik bij mijn vader zocht is op een verschrikkelijke manier misbruikt ik ben bang dat ik als ik straks zelf een dochter krijg geen enkele man meer vertrouw
6968919 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
6968920 we had to come out strong we knew it would be tough im glad we pulled it off
6968921 it feels so good quarterback tanner keiley had a good fake the linebacker stopped and didnt know whether to take me or tanner
6968922 we only had the one breakdown there at the end
6968923 this loss is going to be hard to take but we cant cry over spilled milk and we just have to look toward working harder next week
6968924 but we didnt look like the same team in the second half and we showed some pride and never felt like the game was over
6968925 they stole the momentum from us by getting those three turnovers in a row
6968926 then they started pounding the ball at us and we made too many mistakes to win this game
6968927 we had some chances to win this game but we just couldnt get it done
6968928 tell everyone to text vp to be the first to know
6968929 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
6968930 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see rodriguez
6968931 were very supportive of dr schiller and we will hear a variety of proposals about getting the sport reinstated there are no plans in place but we are very interested in remaining on this international platform
6968932 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues or of being called up arent allowed to come
6968933 i think thatd be great but thats a decision major league baseball would have to make and now that we have the world baseball classic i dont see that
6968934 we would like you to re activate your account we have new stuff
6968935 to be the one to put the toe tag on you
6968936 i dont see what else could have done that even throwing a cigarette butt down in the mulch wouldnt have made it catch fire like that
6968937 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
6968938 when we are talking two states for two people the idea is israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is the homeland for the palestinians without this concept there is no agreement
6968939 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy biden said
6968940 show dialog when an unknown application tries to load ffdshow
6968941 i think one bad dive from anyone and theyre out of the competition thats the high standard of the competition
6968942 its also clear that the theft of up to 110 gigalitres of water in victoria by piping it into melbourne is an enormous disservice if not insult to the people of south australia in particular
6968943 that is not without significant risk its also important to be focused on water supply to communities along the way and tourism
6968944 that negative of not having her has turned into a positive
6968945 a lot of people are still under the rubble we have recovered eight bodies
6968946 if i knew how much the painting was going to sell for i never would have agreed to surrendering all the proceeds
6968947 i am worried that with this much cash in hand she might leave me but in all honesty she deserves every penny for having put up with me for so long
6968948 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
6968949 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen and magic johnson on the dream team that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible id love to see rodriguez
6968950 were very supportive of dr schiller and we will hear a variety of proposals about getting the sport reinstated there are no plans in place but we are very interested in remaining on this international platform
6968951 but baseball is such a big business in the united states
6968952 i think she has no conflicted feelings about it i think that she is all about the club shes all about her family she loves her life and the lifestyle that this has provided for her she sees nothing wrong with what she does
6968953 yes shes all that shes vicious shes ferocious shes a hard ass i look at her as a survivor i look at all of these people theyve created their own little world they all come from their own fragmented lives to kind of come together and form their own family
6968954 whatever her history is it has left her being somebody that is a fighter what we can expect is that if shes at all threatened by any kind of potential for breakup of her family or harm to her son she will go to any lengths to protect that you will see that in various forms
6968955 its all a means to an end for her and whatever she needs to do in the pilot you see her do some pretty harsh things when her son and grandson are threatened and from her perspective what needs to be done
6968956 gemma has been there since the beginning the history is that gemma and her first husband john teller were married when that club was formed shes been there and then clay also started the club with her previous husband shes aware and witness to all the goings on
6968957 the influence that the women have in that world and particularly someone like gemma is a very overt one actually
6968958 i dont think it would be an obvious role over any situation its pretty much a mans world but there are always some pretty strong women behind that mans world
6968959 we have maggie siff and drea de mateo taryn manning drive hustle amp flow is there now shes doing a four or five episode arch shes fantastic so the girls are really strong
6968960 t he important thing about gemma and clay one of the important things is that theyre a happily married couple theyre not an uptight married couple they like each other they have a lot of passion for each other its a fun relationship ron and i have that chemistry together
6968961 small value and small blend have certainly held up better year to date mostly in recent times
6968962 when you have a big drop any recovery can seem large
6968963 i think if you take it and just assume that all small caps are doing better or will do better i think you can get trapped
6968964 it doesnt have the feel of a normal bottom of the market and a lot of the stocks arent selling for prices that you find at the bottom
6968965 youre going to want to put a premium on a managers skill and lower expenses and a sensible strategy and anything else you would look for in any other fund
6968966 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6968967 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6968968 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states

6968971 reasonable compromise that will soften the impact to family budgets
6968972 the very business model of independent investment banks is coming under fire
6968973 this is a reminder that the days of the stand alone investment bank are numbered and that they must increasingly align themselves with universal banks to survive
6968974 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6968975 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6968976 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6968977 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6968978 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6968979 because its so late and you havent eaten dinner and its still very far to your house
6968980 for old people like us its hard to study at all we try so hard but we forget everything immediately its not like young people who pick things up quickly in america you have laws about school and education is mandatory if you dont send your kids to school then the police come after you but not in vietnam in vietnam its different theres not enough money for school and the oldest children have to drop out to take care of the younger ones theres not enough money and too many children sister ty only studied grade three she never had the chance to learn to read its not like america where there are opportunities
6968981 even if we did go to school no one could concentrate it was so far to go in the countryside we were so tired when we got there and we had to work as well sometimes there were only two meals a day sometimes only one and we had to work hard for that and no one could think about studying we really are trying hard to study our best now but now were so old we really want to learn english weve been here three years and hardly know anything we rarely go outside our home and all we have is each other sometimes we cry together because we are so depressed
6968982 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
6968983 i was going into the prelim last night a little bit nervous and my first dives werent too good
6968984 but coming into the semi final i was hungry to get into the final and again my first dive wasnt so good but i slowly and surely made my way back
6968985 the fourth one is one of my favourite dives so it is normally my most consistent one
6968986 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
6968987 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
6968988 we left a couple tackles out there that could have been made

6968994 the results of our studies have clear implications for marketers managers and policymakers it is worth noting that the normative messages which were messages that we have never seen utilized by hotel chains fared significantly better at spurring participation in the hotels environmental conservation program than did the type of message most commonly utilized by hotel chains messages that focus on the importance of environmental protection
6968995 our standard goal is to score 25 or more points on offense and give up 15 or less on defense
6968996 if you can hold a team to two scores in a football game and you can score four youre going to win a bunch of games we dont want to have to outscore people and we really dont want to force a defensive stand
6968997 the quarterback did a good job of finding me tonight and we had good play calling by the coach once we got adjusted to the new offense it went pretty well weve went through a lot of up downs sprints and punishment to learn it but weve got it all right now
6968998 our defensive ends technique wise they played a little wide early in the game and he fred best was up under their technique
6968999 this is where were having some growing pains but johnnie barber did a heck of a job at one defensive end because he was doing his technique and sticking best at the line of scrimmage
6969000 needless to say we will not be scheduling columbia in any type of football activities in the foreseeable future well get a win without playing just like last year were going to focus on the positive thing and get an extra day of practice to work on things

6969010 cristiano has been jogging all week it is only jogging but i am quite pleased about that the plan was to give him one month of rehab work he is doing the aerobic work in the gym he is one week into that there is good progress being young it sometimes helps in terms of recovery and getting back quicker the physios must do their job properly there is no point rushing it

6969016 the city has simply slammed the door in our face

6969018 and then theres seeming like you are doing that no one in the city has told me the firefighters dont deserve to have these increases
6969019 if they do not get this at the bargaining table they have this as an avenue
6969020 it was a fair decision we compromised all through the negotiations we gave up quite a bit

6969029 making silly claims like this is what gives lawyers their poor public image
6969030 for the same people who said they would not have bought tickets last year for games here in seattle to now say they want tickets in oklahoma city is a farce
6969031 without honoring its contractual obligations to offer emerald club members their priority seats at 2007 08 prices
6969032 plaintiffs concede they cannot force the team to relocate back to seattle instead they now want the team to relocate its former fans to oklahoma
6969033 thus plaintiffs ask this court to order the team to sell former seattle fans irrevocable tickets to games at ford center and to fly more than 1 300 people to oklahoma 41 times a year for the next two years for free

6969176 so according to mark the opportunity to be on cbs doesnt help him does it then mark needs to tell that to the winners of american idol or survivor or even the losers of those shows who have all blasted into the stratosphere
6969177 he needs to say that to any competitor or athlete who has had an opportunity to be showcased on national television you think michael phelps would be on sports illustrated on wheaties boxes would be the no 1 google search you think that would happen if he didnt have the platform of network television to be showcased on he would just be another swimmer winning awards

6969191 the credit for keefers being one of the seven wonders goes to jerry and gerri
6969192 it all boils down to people liking to know who they are dealing with and if you are around long enough you get to know your customers

6969202 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6969203 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6969204 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6969205 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6969206 i felt like i was in a good rhythm everything was going well id love to get a complete game in there but even if i dont i know im still doing my job

6969209 but we can change remotely the status of what we want that camera to be doing there are chips in these cameras that will activate the equipment if a particular individual stands in this position for this period of time
6969210 maybe tomorrow its providing security coverage for equipment that may have been stolen
6969211 if something makes that camera start to roll they can dispatch someone
6969212 take a digital picture and it captures the exact location using gps
6969213 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6969214 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6969215 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6969216 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6969217 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems

6969285 if i were sitting on the end of a pier on a summer day enjoying the sunshine and the air and someone came along and jumped into the water and got drowned to prove his love for me i should find it quite unintelligible i might be much in need of love but an act in no rational relation to any of my necessities could not prove it but if i had fallen over the pier and were drowning and someone sprang into the water and at the cost of making my peril or what but for him would be my fate his own saved me from death then i should say greater love hath no man than this i should say it intelligibly because there would be an intelligible relation between the sacrifice which love made and the necessity from which it redeemed the key to the whole of new testament teaching is as we look to the cross he bore our sins he died our death it is so that his love constrains us

6969288 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
6969289 i would note that senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed all three are bills which evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

6969293 i used to call the man fat pig and he used to find it funny his wife was always yelling at me for something or other and cursing me out in italian for the longest time i swore puttana whore was my first name and stronza shit was my middle name their daughter was named leonore good lord she was something thick glasses acne braces and her breath was always hot and putrid i remember her clearly she always hurt me with her braces drew blood from me on purpose i took it like a champ though when i was old enough to realize they wanted to see me cry i learned to keep it inside i guess thats why they escalated their beatings because i refused to give them the satisfaction of crying or begging for mercy even when they no no you dont need to know that ah shit okay you know i saw her once when i was pregnant she was standing right next to me getting ready to cross the street she didnt even see me honestly it took all the strength i had not to push her into traffic for as long as it took the traffic light to change i was suddenly a kid again and so scared i wanted to run and hide and then i felt a flurry of little butterfly movements in my belly and that brought me back to reality and it made me smile i looked over to where she was and i realized she had no power over me i remember thinking to myself that she had probably been his victim as well and felt sorry for her

6969419 en la primera sesi n nos centramos en el estudio del nuevo circuito es asfalto estaba muy sucio esta ma ana y tuvimos que esperar un poco a que fuera cogiendo goma
6969420 realmente me gusta el nuevo circuito urbano de valencia han hecho un grna trabajo
6969421 los organizadores han hecho un trabajo fant stico valencia es una gran pista
6969422 tuvimos una jornada habitual para ser un d a viernes pese a que es un trazado nuevo para todos
6969423 hemos cumplido con nuestro programa para hoy que se basaba fundamentalmente en acumular tantos kil metros como fuera posible y en verificar nuestras simulaciones
6969424 he aprovechado las tres horas de entrenamientos libres para completar muchas vueltas al circuito y recoger una gran cantidad de informaci n que nos ser de mucha utilidad en lo que resta de fin de semana
6969425 estamos encantados de ver que los pilotos han conseguido recorrer la pista sin ning n tipo de problema para los neum ticos
6969426 they wont let me protest then they sentence me to a year labour camp i am really mad
6969427 but we are not afraid we will go on protesting you can see this is not fair do you understand that
6969428 we never committed any crime when we were young now we are so old we cant even speak clearly how can we possible commit a crime
6969429 what crime they have the power so what they say counts we are just ordinary citizens and we have no voice we are victims
6969430 and they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and the fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers and awe came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles and all who believed were together and had all things in common and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need and day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes they received their food with glad and generous hearts praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved
6969431 as you sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
6969432 as the father has sent me even so i am sending you
6969433 since therefore the children share in flesh and blood he himself likewise partook of the same things therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect
6969434 for it was fitting that he for whom and by whom all things exist in bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering 18 for because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
6969435 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
6969436 it is not a matter of commission or compassion but a commission of compassion
6969437 for though i am free from all i have made myself a servant to all that i might win more of them to the jews i became as a jew in order to win jews to those under the law i became as one under the law though not being myself under the law that i might win those under the law to those outside the law i became as one outside the law not being outside the law of god but under the law of christ that i might win those outside the law to the weak i became weak that i might win the weak i have become all things to all people that by all means i might save some i do it all for the sake of the gospel that i may share with them in its blessings
6969438 as the father sent me into the world so send i you
6969439 and being found in human form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross
6969440 i appeal to you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your spiritual worship
6969441 the reason the early church grew so fast in the first three centuries is that they out thought out loved and out served their contemporaries
6969442 for the love of christ controls us because we have concluded this that one has died for all therefore all have died and he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised
6969443 may the lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all as we do for you
6969444 i am under obligation both to greeks and to barbarians both to the wise and to the foolish so i am eager to preach the gospel
6969445 i pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of christ
6969446 that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you so that you too may have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
6969447 for it is all for your sake so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of god
6969448 dr b i want to thank the people of this church it saved our lives

6969496 but then daniel craig emerged from the sea in casino royale in his pants and all that changed craig is a lot more muscular beefier and that is now the ideal look
6969497 the danger is that many teenagers either take too much of the shakes instead of a nutritious diet
6969498 they will not provide you with the essential vitamins and minerals you get from fresh fruit vegetables and starchy carbs
6969499 everyone is growing up far too quickly some 15 to 16 year old boys are working out like men is this good for them
6969500 i dont think it is it seems like they are losing some of their innocence boys should be boys running around the park with a football not straining themselves pumping iron in the local gym
6969501 i think they need to enjoy their youth and not succumb to this huge pressure to have perfect abs bulging biceps and a ripped torso they have enough to worry about with puberty education
6969502 i dont want to be obese i work out so when its hot i can take my top off with pride i like the admiring looks i get it makes me feel good

6969519 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
6969520 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
6969521 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
6969522 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
6969523 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems

6969686 the us and europe accounted for roughly four and three percent respectively of the growth during this period
6969687 india contributed eight percent and china a staggering 57 percent
6969688 today the rapid coal dependent development of china and india is the most important driver of growth in global carbon dioxide emissions coal pro vides 70 percent of commercial energy in china and 56 percent in india
6969689 recent trends suggest that most of the growth in emissions from human activities will come from the developing world in fact based on the average growth rates for the past five years chinas emissions from fossil fuels will surpass those of the us some time in 2008
6969690 the key to stabilising the global climate will be moving industrial nations to a low carbon energy economy while ensuring that developing countries can leapfrog to cleaner development paths
6969691 the potential for de carbonising modern economies is huge energy efficiency wind solar and hydro power are carbon free energy alternatives that are available today germany for example already gets 14 percent of its electricity from renewable sources and hopes to increase this to 45 percent by 2030

6969696 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6969697 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6969698 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6969699 prince charles said the right thing i fully agree with his views one has to only take a look around punjab and see the devastation wrought by the green revolution and the accompanying high use of pesticides fertiliser and water
6969700 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
6969701 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
6969702 punjab is only 1 5 percent of the geographical area of india but it consumes 18 percent of the pesticides of india it has the highest cropping intensity 190 percent and with 83 percent area under crops the people of punjab are exposed to the highest probability rate of pesticide exposure
6969703 the food chain is contaminated it is heavily loaded with pesticides and from vegetables to breast milk everything contains pesticides even our blood contains a cocktail of pesticides
6969704 punjab is facing a cancer epidemic now courtesy the green revolution
6969705 the green revolution brought short lived prosperity and has taken away the very sustainability of our state punjab it was perishable prosperity it left us with a poisoned ecosystem contaminated food chain empty aquifers contaminated water sources destroyed biodiversity debts disease and suicides it is a devastating situation
6969706 gave a lot of money to the punjab government when amarinder singh was in power under his bhumi vardan foundation to help farmers switch to organic and more healthier farming methods but the government ate up the money
6969707 charles is to visit punjab soon as he is concerned about the poisoned ecosystem in the state
6969708 the green revolution ushered in food security for the country increased productivity many times over
6969709 there has been some degradation of natural resources pau is working on ways to arrest it
6969710 with regard to depletion of underground water we are working on ways to grow crops so that water requirement is reduced the state government has passed a law allowing rice sowing only after june 15 when the rains come and dependence on underground water is less
6969711 we do not advise any spraying of pesticides except for weedicides on the ground which is a compulsion
6969712 adopt a holistic approach in order to overcome the problems encountered during the first green revolution
6969713 students with high levels of involuntary subordination were more likely to experience recurring episodes of major depression even after controlling for lifetime history of major depression and current depressive status
6969714 an evolutionary theory of depression in which people feel there is no escape from negative circumstances or feelings and adapt by withdrawing in order to avoid further emotional harm
6969715 it was crucial to show that involuntary subordination was itself causing depression and not vice versa

6969743 swiss banks must verify your identity and wont accept your business if they think it is illegal says ken wassell ceo of los angeles california based offshore company a firm that aids its customers in overseas financial services

6969747 i get letters nearly once a month from americans asking about swiss banks
6969748 i recently got one from a man in virginia asking for help in finding a bank to hold his retirement savings account for him and his wife but thats not what swiss banks really do they are into professional asset management a six figure sum is usually the starting point for opening an account
6969749 most people opening a swiss bank account or doing so for privacy and from potential litigation
6969750 americans account for a very small percentage of our business currently
6969751 the qi regulations are definitely slowing banks down when it comes to americans opening swiss accounts
6969752 there are less americans now then during the reagan administration because inflation was so high then
