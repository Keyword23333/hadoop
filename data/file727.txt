7270003 indicates that assad can be trusted more in negotiations because he is willing to make positive and far reaching changes
7270004 lebanon is still not independent it is under the syrian iranian occupation via the hezbollah power over the lebanese government

7270013 diageos end game is to form a total alcohol company with beer wine and spirits what they are doing is waiting for the beer companies to sort themselves out and then it is not beyond the bounds of reason for them to merge with a company such as heineken consolidation in the beer industry has a long way to go yet
7270014 the us is likely to see a continued modest decline in volume growth as the housing crises in ireland spain and the uk partially offset by robust pricing result in organic top line growth slowing
7270015 the company and most investors now acknowledge that the future of guinness has been generating very good growth in nigeria and other african countries in recent years and i expect this trend to continue in future years as disposable incomes continue to rise in that part of the world

7270038 i dont like khaki khaki is boring id like to see some colors
7270039 khaki is a great color well how about these jeans
7270040 ive never really liked pre faded jeans and those scuffs are the same on every single pair im fine with jeans wearing out but when every single pair has wear marks in exactly the same place thats not really me it looks contrived and not authentic i always strive to be authentic
7270041 theyre all scuffed in the same place to keep you know the production level efficient
7270042 im not saying thats what you are about im a regular customer here you dont have to convince me that this is a good company
7270043 i know you look familiar i think these jeans are very unique
7270044 they would be unique if only one person had them they would be great in a conformist society everyone could look unique in exactly the same way we live in a free society we dont vote for a candidate because everyone else is voting for them we vote for candidates we believe in same thing smaller scale i dont happen to want the exact same wear marks on my jeans as everyone else no big deal
7270045 uh you could try it for size then i can check another store to see if they have it

7270054 face transplantation has moved from ethical debate to surgical reality
7270055 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
7270056 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
7270057 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
7270058 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour
7270059 however we must acknowledge the long term medical risks such as transplant rejection and the need for life long medication associated with the procedure there is also the potential of psychological impact following such a transplant

7270107 the british team is ready and thats important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population
7270108 that has been achieved four years beforehand and they will be able to improve even on that
7270109 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and also for all the subsequent games
7270110 i believe and i hope that london can put the bar even higher so that we have consistent improvement and evolution of the olympic games
7270111 london has unique assets athens was returning to the roots to the country that invented the olympic games china was the most populous country in the world
7270112 london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play
7270113 it is a cosmopolitan multi ethnic and multi religious city and thats something they can build on

7270120 our expectation was that he would lose our wrestler was not very good
7270121 and i think that i should slit my belly to apologize
7270122 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge
7270123 the reality is that neither barack obama nor nuri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be lost at this point

7270136 das mehrst ndige b hnenprogramm und die kinderstra e die st nde der demokratischen parteien und initiativen aus dem stadtteil sowie drei ausstellungen sprachen mehrere hundert b rger der alten neustadt darunter viele familien mit kindern an
7270137 in geradezu vorbildlicher weise haben hier die anwohner eines stadtteils ehrenamtliches engagement f r die st rkung der demokratie gezeigt
7270138 ich bin davon berzeugt dass die akteure gest rkt aus dem stra enfest hervorgehen und es gelingt tragf hige strukturen zur auseinandersetzung mit den lokalen rechtsextremen herausforderungen zu etablieren
7270139 oh make no mistake its not the revenge hes after its a reckoning

7270148 es gibt eine grenze wie lange wir das tun k nnen an irgendeinem punkt hat die ezb dann den ganzen markt bernommen
7270149 wenn wir sehen dass die banken zu abh ngig von der ezb werden m ssen wir sie zur ckweisen
7270150 niemand wagt es mit dem finger auf ein land zu zeigen denn wenn man das machen w rde w rde das sofort den zusammenbruch der banken bedeuten
7270151 wir haben es hier mit einem sonderbaren system zu tun in dem die schuldner sich der eigenen zentralbank entziehen und zu einer anderen gehen wo sie billiger und einfacher an geld kommen
7270152 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7270153 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7270154 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7270155 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7270156 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7270157 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7270158 the rally in lal chowk is to remind india of its promises
7270159 my uncle terry died earlier this year and hes always told me to believe in myself i want to dedicate this to him and i felt that he was with me during the play off
7270160 ive been hitting into bunkers all week and i finally found one that was sitting up perfectly it was the easiest shot i just had to splash it out and hope for the best ive never been that excited
7270161 i hit a good bunker shot in the play off but didnt have the luck rick had the luck with him
7270162 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7270163 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7270164 the alliance is intact today but its future depends on the fulfilment of the promise zardari made for the restoration of the judges
7270165 our initial investigation shows that scores of civilians have been killed the tragedy is much more serious than we had initially thought
7270166 during the telephone conversation between the russian and french presidents there was no discussion about replacing russian peacekeeping troops by an osce mission in the buffer zone
7270167 no withdrawal has been mentioned today the russians are keeping all their previous illegal checkpoints
7270168 promote and emphasize the alternative transportation research goes on here at psu
7270169 it could be the first time in a long time that we had the top two officials coming from an urban environment and im not just saying coming just from a big city or an inner city im talking about an urban environment and that includes places such as kane county lake county joliet its urban its not just a city its a good perspective for us for the federal government which is much more rural in its history and not more urban
7270170 from the point of view of a big city mayor i think barack obama couldnt have picked a better vice president
7270171 he will be very warmly received by the mayors of this country
7270172 sa tyr n 1 in mythology a woodland deity represented as a man with goats legs ears and horns 2 the very essence of raw sexual desire

7270181 de la pr ctica m s que habitual del consell del pp
7270182 gastar en lo que no toca y abandonar las prioridades de los valencianos
7270183 nadie niega menos el pspv la necesidad de variar el modelo aznar de financiaci n
7270184 debemos exigir que se abandone definitivamente la pol tica de despilfarro y dilapidaci n que vienen practicando los sucesivos presidentes populares
7270185 si se renuncia a la pol tica de dilapidaci n de recursos p blicos no importa cu l sea la financiaci n ni el montante ni el modelo porque siempre ser deficitaria para el ritmo y la capacidad que camps y su consell tiene para gastarse el dinero de todos los valencianos
7270186 los valencianos han de saber que son ellos quienes pagan
7270187 ser a bueno que supieran tambi n que es camps qui n se gasta su dinero
7270188 desarrolle el estatut y ponga en funcionamiento la agencia tributaria valenciana
7270189 los valencianos identificar an n tidamente qui n recauda y qui n gasta as como a qui n beneficia el gasto
7270190 ya podr seguir simulando que paga y no le dan nada
7270191 tiene el apoyo del pspv para mejorar la financiaci n

7270228 the 05 cabs are tightly wound and have really desirable structure they remind me of the 92 94 and 03 cabs
7270229 i always think of rutherford as the aristocracy of napa valley wines i have tasted and enjoyed them for 15 years they are generally restrained wines with an evident texture which other appellations in napa valley just dont achieve
7270230 i think the cabernets from rutherford in a classic vintage should show some restrained herbaceous character or what we call rutherford dust if you have too many herb flavors you taste green bell peppers which is one extreme at the other end without some restrained herb notes all you have are plump fruit flavors the essence of a rutherford cabernet is a subtle restrained herbaceous note between these two extremes
7270231 you had to actively manage your crop we had a lot of rain in the spring which caused vines to grow rapidly if you didnt cut back this vigor you were left with herbaceous wines
7270232 a typical rutherford cabernet on the nose and on the palate an extremely well structured wine with a bulls eye focus
7270233 one thing i usually find at this annual tasting is that price is not always a perfect indicator of quality almost every year i blindly identify a 40 50 wine that scores as many points as a triple digit dollar wine and this year was no exception

7270274 je mag geen brood kopen op sabbat maar geweld mag kennelijk wel op de dag des heren
7270275 ik geloof dat de zevende dags adventisten al zijn ze totaal krankzinnig in dit opzicht groot gelijk hebben er is op grond van wat hierover in het nieuwe testament te vinden is niet de minste aanleiding om de wekelijkse rustdag van de zaterdag naar de zondag te verschuiven dat jezus op een zondag opgestaan zou zijn en dat dat een reden is om nu voortaan de zondag als rustdag te wijden is op geen enkele manier bewijsbaar nee de inwoners van de piet heinstraat hadden het gelijk aan hun zijde
7270276 het is niet het bijbelwoord maar nota bene een keizer geweest keizer constantijn die ons met die onzalige zondagsheiliging heeft opgescheept halverwege de vierde eeuw bepaalde keizer constantijn dat de zondag een rustdag zal zijn en dan zien we hoe de inhoud van deze dag steeds meer gevuld wordt met bepalingen die ontleend zijn aan de joodse sabbatviering
7270277 dit jaar zet ik mijn tomatenplanten uit op zondag je opbrengst is bijna anderhalf keer zo groot
7270278 ik heb er geen verklaring voor dat mijn zondagarbeid al die jaren zo rijkelijk gezegend is wel weet ik dat zaterdag de slechtste dag van de week is van wat je op zaterdag plant of zaait is de opbrengst minder dan op andere dagen
7270279 zou t dan zo zijn dat het niet de zondag is die strikt geheiligd dient te worden maar zoals overigens duidelijk in de bijbel staat de zaterdag nergens in het woord des heren is ook maar de minste aanwijzing te vinden dat het terecht is dat de te heiligen sabbatdag verschoven is van de zaterdag naar de zondag
7270280 ik denk niet dat oekra ne een makkelijke tegenstander is
7270281 hij is een grote voetballer en de leider van het nationale team hij moet serieus worden genomen
7270282 ach ik heb altijd wel geweten dat die kritiek op zou houden we wisten dat we nog twintig tot dertig procent meer uit de spelers konden halen daarom zijn we in de voorbereiding op dit toernooi naar sardini geweest door de conditietrainingen die we daar gedaan hebben kan elke speler in onze selectie nu het beste in zichzelf naar boven halen

7270290 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7270291 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything

7270299 hoe is het mogelijk dat sommige nederlanders dat niet meer weten
7270300 moet zoiets geregeld worden in een winkelsluitingswet voor de zondag
7270301 jullie vieren de dag van de schepping wij de dag van de herschepping in de opstandingsdag van christus
7270302 zidane heeft niks gezegd hij was erg teleurgesteld voor iedereen voor zichzelf en voor het team ik ben erg bedroefd voor hem het was zijn laatste wk en iedereen wilde voor hem winnen
7270303 he has got the foreign policy experience a demographic that obama hasnt quite gotten yet
7270304 im just very excited to see what those two can do
7270305 there is a lot of conflict a lot of sex and a lot of great medical cases too
7270306 the scripts are so tight and the cast is fantastic we have a lot of great guest stars
7270307 als je zag waar nederland na euro 2000 stond dat was n groot drama tot dit jaar hebben we vanaf dat moment ook maar aan n groot toernooi meegedaan het ek van 2004 in portugal van basten is gaan analyseren wat de mogelijkheden waren je kunt pas zaken echt kloppend maken als je de spelers een week of drie achtereen bij elkaar hebt
7270308 als je dan kijkt hoe het nederlands elftal het alles incalculerend vervolgens heeft gedaan zeg ik uitstekend als je alle kwaliteiten en mogelijkheden bekijkt de manier van spelen de spelers over wie je kunt beschikken en ga zo maar door dan zeg ik het nederlands elftal kon eenvoudig niet beter je hebt het maximale eruit gehaald en als je het maximale uit iets gehaald hebt dan heb je het dus uitstekend gedaan
7270309 veel mensen denken dat ik dat zeg omdat ik bevriend ben met van basten maar dat maakt mij niet uit als iemand het goed doet dan doet hij het goed doet hij het fout dan doet hij het fout of je nou bevriend met hem bent of niet
7270310 wat zijn de basiskwaliteiten van van bommel hij moet helpen in de verdediging en daarnaast als tweede man naast de spits in het strafschopgebied komen om daar te scoren dan krijgt hij tijdens de vier wk wedstrijden twaalf tot veertien schietkansen waaronder een beeldschone tegen portugal als je die dan allemaal niet benut dan heb je niet bepaald een hoog rendement en hij is ook geen type om negentig minuten lang zijn man uit te schakelen dan kun je zeggen ok dan had van basten hem eruit moeten halen maar omdat er al zoveel stemming gemaakt was heeft hij van bommel laten staan
7270311 als ik gewild had dat jij het begrepen had zou ik het ook wat duidelijker hebben uitgelegd
7270312 ik heb graag dat voetballers tijdens een wedstijd bewegen en lopen in het veld maar als ze niet weten waar naar toe dan heb ik liever dat ze blijven staan
7270313 dat stond van tevoren al vast het nederlands elftal was een belangrijk onderdeel van het journaal nu oranje is uitgeschakeld heeft het weinig zin meer om het wk journaal uit te zenden
7270314 we zaten daar vlak bij het trainingskamp van het nederlands elftal nu dat is uitgeschakeld is het journalistiek gezien niet meer relevant in duitsland te blijven
7270315 de sfeer en de onderwerpen zullen ongetwijfeld anders zijn maar het is nou eenmaal zo we willen de fans van het wk gewoon vanaf locatie blijven bedienen
7270316 ik heb mijn land veertien jaar met trots en eer gediend iedereen in

7270339 i think its very important to start teaching children about recycling and taking care of their environment to better the world and to better their environment they will be growing up in and living in
7270340 they made their decision without even listening to our formal presentation thus turning down an opportunity to play for the team we were led to believe was his dream team receive his college scholarship paid in full get the best care for his arm and become an instant multimillionaire

7270376 ooo look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happyland in a gumdrop house on lollypop laaaaaaane
7270377 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7270378 i have not selected him as i do not think that he was focused enough and i did not feel that he would be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7270379 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7270380 it was a tough games for us we just couldnt get the carbons together to form a cancerous cloud trap heat and sear eyeballs
7270381 i wont do the ravelympics properly i dont want to drop my wips for two weeks straight
7270382 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7270383 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7270384 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7270385 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job
7270386 then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7270387 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7270388 we did our best but the best was not enough
7270389 he has been the most entertaining athlete of these games
7270390 i feel like usain bolt when he won his gold
7270391 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good
7270392 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7270393 im going to go back to my roots watch some tapes of when i ran in jamaica when i used to run and there was no strategy when i just had fun
7270394 hes out here dancing the jamaican moves that we used to do its exciting to watch
7270395 its going to change my life but i wont change so much
7270396 ill be the same person ill still enjoy myself im still young ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can

7270405 weve had three known crack houses on our street and the police have validated this
7270406 im glad to hear theyre doing it were all for that and we have the same interest in having a safe neighborhood that the neighbors do
7270407 we want to make our neighborhood unattractive to the criminals
7270408 there have been a lot more obvious prostitutes in the area and i believe that there is a lack of police participation in patrolling that area
7270409 you may disagree with me but quite often i see two patrol cars sitting in the melbourne auditorium parking lot observing the traffic on hibiscus and i go two blocks around the corner and theres prostitution going on

7270415 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7270416 bob said to me that hes going to take everything hes done coaching me and throw it out the door and try something completely different just to see how it works
7270417 well try a bunch of new things if were successful great if not we can go back to what weve been doing
7270418 you can still do everything and still be successful you can do anything and everything one of the biggest things ive learned over last four years is that anythings possible
7270419 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7270420 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7270421 from day one weve been together its been a bond for the last three years
7270422 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7270423 the good news is unsolicited five or six of these guys said they want to be part of this going forward
7270424 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7270425 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7270426 the first one is still being remembered today so you can how imagine this one is being received
7270427 if anyone said one month ago we would play in the final they would not have been believed it shows what small nations can achieve
7270428 i have been waiting for this for 22 years ever since i started following the exploits of the icelandic handball team
7270429 it was a magical moment proud is a word that cant begin to describe how i feel
7270430 i was crying my eyes we went into the game to win
7270431 dinart told me we were in the greatest sporting event in the world
7270432 i tell myself that we have not lost the gold but won the silver
7270433 i am the happiest man in asia i am going to have a shower and dance naked in the street

7270441 i am the happiest man in asia i am going to have a shower and dance naked in the street
7270442 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face
7270443 there was unanimity of the decision to postpone the event until october next year
7270444 when you are playing well you feel comfortable on all courts
7270445 in the past when i was playing well i did well on hard courts too i feel good for sure i won two tournaments in toronto and the olympics and i played semi finals in cincinnati
7270446 i think i need the crowd support a little bit this year
7270447 but i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open its a tough tournament to win
7270448 i had a tough year and ive been struggling quite a lot
7270449 its tough to expect results but i will try my best
7270450 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with the top players
7270451 un frondoso vergel escondido comento el gerente de desarrollo integral del valle del ambroz diva diego curto donde el agua es protagonista siendo en primavera y oto o cuando salta desde las cumbres por los arroyos y gargantas
7270452 hacer las delicias de las gentes en las piscinas de aguas frescas y transparentes
7270453 tres actores que representaron la estaci n oto al ataviados con hojas secas del valle contando a los visitantes que esta zona cuenta con unos olores y colores m gicos
7270454 queremos aprovechar la oportunidad que nos brinda la junta para presentar la xi edici n del oto o m gico que este a o se celebrar del 31 de octubre al 30 de noviembre
7270455 ha querido seg n curto portela transmitir que el referente sean las diferentes culturas que han pasado por el ambroz y la huella que de ellas ha quedado
7270456 su recuerdo permanecer fuerte e inalterable en la memoria colectiva de los ciudadanos y ciudadanas y ellos los terroristas y sus secuaces acabar n en la c rcel cumpliendo condena por los delitos que han cometido
7270457 es un gesto que honra a un pueblo que ha visto tambi n caer a muchos de sus ciudadanos a manos de los asesinos de eta
7270458 el pueblo extreme o ha dejado mucha sangre derramada en euskadi por los atentados de los terroristas victimas algunas que adem s de ser violentamente asesinadas sufrieron la humillaci n y el doble dolor de abandonar euskadi por la puerta de atr s solas insultadas y ante la indiferencia y la mirada fr a de muchos de nosotros
7270459 eso hoy ha cambiado las v ctimas merecen la puerta principal en la casa de la democracia que hemos construido entre todos y todas
7270460 enorme lecci n de dignidad y entereza que demuestran d a a d a las v ctimas del terrorismo
7270461 siempre han permanecido frente a la violencia siempre denunciando la sinraz n de la misma y lo que es m s importante siempre dando una enorme lecci n de democracia y ciudadan a apostando por el valor de la palabra educando a sus hijos en la paz y la libertad y no en el rencor y la venganza
7270462 jam s podremos recompensar ni reparar tanto dolor tanta injusticia y tan grande lecci n de humanidad y ciudadan a
7270463 no hay mayor ni m s cruel cadena perpetua que haber enterrado a tu padre a tus hijos por el zarpazo de la banda terrorista saber que no volver n y que los asesinos de los mismos disfruten con ese dolor ante la mirada impasible o condescendiente de la sociedad
7270464 when you are playing well you feel comfortable on all courts
7270465 in the past when i was playing well i did well on hard courts too i feel good for sure i won two tournaments in toronto and the olympics and i played semi finals in cincinnati
7270466 i think i need the crowd support a little bit this year
7270467 but i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open its a tough tournament to win
7270468 i had a tough year and ive been struggling quite a lot
7270469 its tough to expect results but i will try my best
7270470 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with the top players
7270471 beschrieben wir erwarten eine verborgene wahrheit hinter dem festgehaltenem moment die aber vom photo niemals erf llt werden kann
7270472 there is usually increased interest during a presidential year election and we thought it would add to the primaries
7270473 we could not believe it when we saw the shore
7270474 it was one small step for humankind and one giant step for palestine
7270475 this is a symbolic mission and the idea is to break the siege
7270476 israel should have no right to control the movement of palestinians
7270477 but im in israeli society and i have to choose my battles
7270478 in accordance with the government decision the prisoner release will be carried out tomorrow monday at 9 30 am 0630 gmt
7270479 the prisoners underwent medical examination they were interviewed by red cross representatives and they will be transferred tomorrow to the beituniya checkpoint
7270480 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding
7270481 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners

7270486 que abandone su servilismo empresarial y su cobard a pol tica respecto a la refiner a balboa y su oleoducto
7270487 la junta no tiene que rechazar ni aceptar el oleoducto sino evitar riesgos para el medio ambiente
7270488 cinta castillo sigue utilizando la ambig edad calculada el doble lenguaje el oscurantismo informativo el cinismo tecnicista y la desviaci n de responsabilidades hacia los ministerios de industria y medio ambiente para justificar su servilismo empresarial hacia el grupo alfonso gallardo y su lobby de intereses en la provincia de huelva de la que procede la consejera
7270489 la consejera de medio ambiente continu p rez tapias muestra una gran cobard a pol tica pues no se atreve a decir claramente y de una vez por todas lo que ya nadie duda que la junta de andaluc a apoya el proyecto de la refiner a balboa y de su oleoducto porque ste es un proyecto apoyado por el psoe federal y el psoe extreme o por la junta de extremadura y por el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero
7270490 cinta castillo como consejera de medio ambiente no puede limitarse a comentar las alegaciones que le han preparado los t cnicos
7270491 ambigua pues ante proyectos como ste debe defender los principios rectores de las pol ticas p blicas y las competencias establecidas en el estatuto de autonom a y hay muchas razones para que andaluc a se oponga radicalmente a un proyecto que no aporta ning n beneficio para las provincias de huelva y de sevilla y s graves impactos negativos al medio ambiente a la actividad econ mica a la salud y al patrimonio cultural
7270492 quien ha tenido un error de c lculo no han sido iu y pp pues ya conoc amos el proyecto y a sus promotores sino el psoe a que nunca imagin el rechazo un nime a ste proyecto del movimiento ecologista y de los dem s partidos pol ticos y el amplio rechazo social mostrado en las miles de alegaciones presentadas al proyecto
7270493 muestra de ello son tambi n el silencio obediente de sus concejales en los municipios afectados por la refiner a balboa y sus instalaciones complementarias as como las contradicciones manifestadas en las ltimas declaraciones realizadas por mario jim nez secretario general del psoe de huelva demetrio p rez delegado del gobierno de la junta de andaluc a en sevilla y otros dirigentes del psoe como javier barrero o la propia cinta castillo
7270494 voluntad de trasladar la experiencia de las riberas del ebro al guadiana
7270495 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7270496 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7270497 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7270498 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job
7270499 then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7270500 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7270501 we did our best but the best was not enough

7270503 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7270504 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7270505 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7270506 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7270507 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7270508 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7270509 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behaviour in any meaningful way
7270510 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7270511 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7270512 if the weather holds out well get out there and do some more sign waving
7270513 we had a couple of days where we didnt have volunteers in the office
7270514 we kind of put the campaign to the side for a bit
7270515 today was a busy day the weather didnt deter us
7270516 i have been an opponent of the war in iraq since before the invasion
7270517 it is typical washington gamesmanship it is what mr feeney does while other people are dealing with their daily lives
7270518 you cant trust anything he says he is just playing political games
7270519 were going to make the rounds again just trying to get out there and meet people keep on shaking hands and keep talking to voters
7270520 itll sneak up on ya cause it sure did me
7270521 the wind was hardly letting me move it came so fast
7270522 i thought i would be more terrified but quickly youre trying to decide what to do
7270523 it shook with such strength im surprised my place even stood it
7270524 nobody expected anything like that im just thankful it could have been worse probably
7270525 scientists working on the phoenix mars lander mission which has already found ice on the planet said preliminary analysis by the landers instruments on a sample of soil scooped up by the spacecrafts robotic arm had shown it to be
7270526 scientists have been using the robotic spacecraft cassini to explore what looked to be large lakes of hydrocarbons on the surface of saturns planet sized moon titan but they couldnt be entirely sure that the features were actually liquid lakes and not simply very smooth solid material now
7270527 were looking at it on a monthly basis right now the market is not that conducive if theres a positive development then well make a decision its really still all about the timing
7270528 we want to be selective we want to find suitable sites
7270529 our strategy to grow our retail network is really through franchising
7270530 first we should be thankful with what we have but if there is a need for change this must always be under consultation
7270531 in the area of change and morals the teachings of the church take precedence over personal opinions even if they are supported by so called scholarly research
7270532 while exchanges and conflicts of opinion may constitute normal expressions of public life in a representative democracy moral teaching certainly can not depend simply upon respect for a process indeed it is in no way established by following the rules and deliberative procedures of a democracy
7270533 i thought that this was not the proper forum for these issues but anyway she heard everything that was said during the mass
7270534 only cebu has a special prayer for peace in mindanao cebuanos are very generous persons
7270535 since the afp chief of staff undeniably has authority to convene a general court martial and sgcm no 2 has jurisdiction over the charges filed against petitioner under the articles of war prohibition cannot be issued to prevent said court martial from exercising its jurisdiction
7270536 other officers would prosecute the charges and render the decision in sgcm no 2 petitioners expectation that the outcome of the court martial will not be in his favor cannot support his claim of bias since prejudice cannot be presumed
7270537 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7270538 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7270539 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7270540 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7270541 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7270542 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games
7270543 so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7270544 it was more teamwork probably well directed by their coaching staff
7270545 ive seen the guys hungry and want to get back to the top
7270546 thats what theyve done they were able to get to the top again and show that they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7270547 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower that we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and gotten this win
7270548 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7270549 what you saw today was a team everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals well what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7270550 we felt that athleticism and great defense would offset a lot of things
7270551 the versatility this squad would have and the character of the guys a lot of that negates size
7270552 weve got a lot of guys on this team that are individually great
7270553 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labour while the games were going on
7270554 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7270555 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7270556 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7270557 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7270558 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see
7270559 there is one narrative that is the accepted narrative if you are on board with that narrative you can fully enjoy the games you can get excited by the chinese gold medals you can be part of this national project
7270560 who do you think keller will end up with and why
7270561 how do we get home when will we get home can we get home
7270562 part of the new focus is a deliberate attempt to bring in younger viewers to watch stargate universe
7270563 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
7270564 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
7270565 xeroxs 9700 laser printer prints the documents i want to print with the speed and quality that i want them printed
7270566 oh my god cpu and gpu on one die is stoooooooopiiiiidddddededddd 1111oneoneone
7270567 dude i have a mac and a pc and the mac crashes all the time
7270568 olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions
7270569 a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy
7270570 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions
7270571 a great nation now demands that its leaders abandon the politics of partisan division
7270572 we fought all these multinational companies for the cheaper medicines law
7270573 we still need a national policy that is comprehensive in scope and adequately funded
7270574 it is seen to be a drug and should be used in a certain way in specific amounts and a certain rhythm it is a treatment and it is important that it remains as such
7270575 we have not been able to do the whole beach
7270576 they were all on the east side of the buildings
7270577 their wings may have become saturated and they lost control
7270578 we call for abolishing the sponsor system and for adopting a system similar to advanced countries
7270579 the only people who benefit from the sponsor system are the visa traders who use their influence to maintain the status quo
7270580 ok cissa the gigs up stop pretending you are a grown up and get back to class
7270581 seriosuly cissa get yer ass over here because your time is up old lady
7270582 im sure we will be better than them without a doubt
7270583 i think weve spent the last two weeks worrying if he was going to go or if he was going to stay and now we can put it to bed and concentrate on the premier league
7270584 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club and the players are as well because he is a talisman for us
7270585 if he wasnt he wouldnt have signed a four year contract so there you go
7270586 he deserved a goal last week against everton and he got his just rewards he could probably have got two or three to be fair
7270587 i came to the game with a spring in my step after the way we had trained and felt that we could do something our shape looked good and i was really looking forward to the game
7270588 now though i am flummoxed and i can only apologise to the fans
7270589 we looked disjointed and we lacked confidence and belief on the ball
7270590 i dont think swansea put us under any undue pressure when we had the ball but at least we could have taken more than one touch we didnt and we paid the price
7270591 at the end of the day i ask them to play accurate balls into the strikers and i didnt see any
7270592 there is a lot of work that needs doing with this squad i have said it before and i will say it again its going to take time as today proves
7270593 it was a very strong finish by us and i would have fancied ourselves to score the next goal but on the balance of play we have to be satisfied with a point
7270594 we needed to do something after going two behind and im very glad that we managed to do that thanks to arturo
7270595 several districts are receiving continuous rains for the past month and a half
7270596 nearly 750 000 people are reeling under the impact of the floods
7270597 the river banks are now swamped and we are ready to plug any breach that may occur in the anti flood embankments
7270598 the talks are not suspended we are just waiting for the high court ruling everybodys awaiting for it executive secretary eduardo ermita said in a phone interview on sunday
7270599 intelligent discussion on when and where to pursue the negotiations
7270600 we continue to let them know developments here and how the governments is reacting ermita said in reference to the continued clashes between government and milf forces on the run after attacking the civilian population in three central mindanao provinces
7270601 let it not be misunderstood that we have stopped the peace process because of this fighting he said
7270602 if milf chair murad is not willing or capable of bringing in his three milf commanders to answer for their terroristic acts then he and his men must stand down as government forces enforce the law short of that there will be no let up in government offensive dureza said in a text message
7270603 the inaction of the milf leadership will be construed as its tacit approval of the criminal acts of its three commanders and will be a clear proof of milf leaderships insincerity to pursue the conclusion of the peace talks he said
7270604 unless the three base commanders of the milf are neutralized and punished in accordance with our laws for their acts of terrorism against innocent and helpless civilians
7270605 we should separate the issue of peace talks from the pursuit operations and the bringing of justice to victims of the milf attacks golez said

7270608 i think weve spent the last two weeks worrying if he was going to go or if he was going to stay and now we can put it to bed and concentrate on the premier league
7270609 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club and the players are as well because he is a talisman for us
7270610 if he wasnt he wouldnt have signed a four year contract so there you go
7270611 he deserved a goal last week against everton and he got his just rewards he could probably have got two or three to be fair
7270612 the lad wants to play football but hes shown over the last two weeks what an important player he is for us
7270613 ive no intention of letting any of the players weve got with us go we feel we can achieve good things this season and its important we keep our first team squad together
7270614 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7270615 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7270616 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7270617 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7270618 because of the draw against newcastle we need to get a win as soon as possible
7270619 but it is not going to be easy you dont get many harder games than a trip to fratton park we have had some poor results down there over the past few years
7270620 i have got into a lot more goalscoring opportunities during pre season but didnt manage to score
7270621 he has got a lot of experience he knows about international football
7270622 he is the kind of guy we need when we are bigger he is a bit big for us now
7270623 maybe when we make the next step i like the management team we have at the moment
7270624 the attitude application and desire of the players to embrace what we are trying to do has been terrific
7270625 doncaster are a very good side one of the best passing sides in the division and we nullified that and we had a creativity
7270626 in terms of the points we have picked up i cant ask any more from the players than to have collected maximum points
7270627 but i do think that there is still more to come from us and that we can get better
7270628 it was a very satisfying three points we knew that there would be some pressure on us playing at home but the players were able to deal with that and it is good that we have been able to keep our momentum going

7270642 its all about pitching and we have it the center fielder said
7270643 and we have more in the minor leagues a lot of it guys are starting to believe that well be competitive in every game we play if we score a couple runs late we can win
7270644 theres moves you can make to get a couple guys in here and thats brians job not mine rowand said
7270645 but i can tell you nobody in this organization wants to win more than he does its why i respect the hell out of him hell do everything in his power to make this team better and were not very far off weve got a lot of great pieces
7270646 our goal is to win series the rest of the season he said
7270647 well make a run at this and see what happens
7270648 he was letting it go too giants manager bruce bochy said
7270649 god puts me through hell so i could make it to heaven
7270650 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field

7270679 posting well present to you a web 2 0 company service and then well ask you the readers to vote if it is real or not but first lets ask an important question that might be plaguing readers of our site
7270680 quando entro no cen rio fico no clima da cena e interajo com os bichos mas saindo daqui morro de medo de pegar qualquer um no colo
7270681 n o consideramos isso como atraso porque s o seq ncias demoradas envolvem muitos figurantes uma maquiagem especial que precisa ser retocada e dois beb s que alternamos com bonecos
7270682 mas hoje em dia outras pessoas da equipe me ajudam
7270683 nas cenas em espa os mais amplos podem chegar a 35 para dar a id ia de muita gente
7270684 inicialmente seria uma participa o de apenas quatro cap tulos mas essa trama se alongou e j est no segundo m s ent o alguns cortes de pessoal foram necess rios at para agilizar o trabalho

7270757 daca va aduceti bine aminte anul trecut in jur de 1000 1500 de fani rapidisti nu au putut sa intre pe ghencea desi aveau biletele in mana putem sa interzicem si noi acest lucru iar din cate imi aduc aminte nici suporterii nostri nu au primit banii inapoi

7270793 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7270794 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7270795 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7270796 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7270797 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7270798 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7270799 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7270800 i want to find out what theyre doing and what we can do to correct whats on the board we have a moral and ethical responsibility to look at these items
7270801 we have a moral and ethical responsibility to look at these items
7270802 the vulnerable and dependent deserve to know that their facilities are safe clean and responsible
7270803 if we know about these things and dont act then shame on us
7270804 taking taxpayer dollars to care for people when you dont care for them is outright fraud
7270805 i think attorney general andrew cuomo should look into this and sue civilly and perhaps a grand jury should be convened to see if criminal action should be pursued for abuse
7270806 some of them they went to hospitals and nursing homes
7270807 we take this up in the health committee pretty regularly as well as the aging committee and social services
7270808 if we are truly to provide community integration for people with mental illness we are going to have to provide the safety net to protect them
7270809 if theyre not doing the job were not going to let it fall on the head or the health or the safety of those who live in those adult homes
7270810 were already in need of more beds for senior citizens so if we come down hard on these people and eliminate beds even more people wont have a place to stay
7270811 if we know about these things and dont act then shame on us
7270812 the vulnerable and dependent deserve to know that their facilities are safe clean and responsible
7270813 until some adult care homes improve above the standards of storage facilities legislative representatives must press the leaders in albany especially gov paterson to address living conditions for patients and dependent residents in the hudson valley
7270814 im not sure we ought to be the primary source of residential mental health services in the state
7270815 its not like they had a straight path to prison
7270816 they didnt have other resources and once youre in the criminal justice system its difficult to get out
7270817 the inmates have thrown urine out there until they have soaked tile right up off the floor
7270818 we just could not get tile to stick to the floor there
7270819 ive been working on my behavior and now theyre going to let me back out into population
7270820 over time because of changes at the state hospital and other places we find were keeping them longer and longer
7270821 you can walk back and forth in your cell two or three hours a day
7270822 all the time youre trying to keep your calm and cool so you can do better things
7270823 they take you over to the clinic and put you in a strip cell where you just get your boxers a mattress and a security blanket
7270824 you can conceivably make their mental illness worse by isolating them too much
7270825 he may have little choice but to go off his medication
7270826 but we almost never get them back to the same level of functioning that they were on that first release
7270827 we struggle with making sure that the men and women who are leaving our facility get a smooth transition and continuity of care particularly medication maintenance once theyre released
7270828 sometimes they take them to jail because they dont know where else to take them
7270829 they will approach consumers of mental health not in an adversarial role but in a way which says they want to help them get the treatment they need
7270830 we need better housing we need more mental health beds you cant solve this by building a bigger jail
7270831 if the economy wasnt this way i wouldve gotten a job in a short period of time and it wouldve stopped the progression of everything else that happened
7270832 were a very small operation and we have very limited funding
7270833 we have never had a may june july and august where we have not only every bed that we have in the state occupied but we have waiting lists
7270834 and in some places we have waiting lists of eight to 10 people for a bed a bed
7270835 by the number of applications were seeing the need is greater and we do attribute that to the fact that they have no money people are living in cars people are sleeping on couches and that gets old
7270836 this is the first summer ive spent where almost every day we are full
7270837 the only reason i have anything open today is i had a family relocate and two men moved out i guarantee by tomorrow itll be full again
7270838 its easy to bounce back when you have one thing go wrong
7270839 said spader who has never lived in a shelter until now
7270840 but then when you lose your job and then you lose shelter and then you lose transportation its very very difficult its a cycle you cant get a job if you cant get there but you cant get a car if you dont have a job
7270841 its much more difficult for individuals grappling with emotional programs to compete successfully in the economic arena
7270842 its harder for them to focus on issues of livelihood when they are depressed they cant sleep or theyre drinking too much
7270843 everywhere across the country people are dealing with veterans in crisis and we have to assume that this is going to eventually impact us here
7270844 we were a resource to veterans struggling with addiction because they could utilize our shelter while they were dealing with this
7270845 post implementation of the city councils requirements we will be required to bar them
7270846 its disgraceful that people who served their country come home to live on the streets
7270847 my fear is thats going to grow with the economy this way
7270848 right now there are not a whole lot of good employment opportunities out there
7270849 im not just going to be on a downhill spiral until life ends
7270850 i feel that everything happens for a reason i always had a caring heart and i wanted to help people but sometimes i would look at them and say why dont they just get a job but now i understand that sometimes you cant just get a job

7271140 what makes this such a powerful icon is that its unbelievably simple and telegraphic
7271141 i think there is something about the spiral design that makes it visually arresting
7271142 may actually see the sound of these blades as reassuring but to others its a visual and sonic intrusion

7271147 it didnt have anything to do with how good the car was
7271148 rockets of course were the icon of the day so capturing that rocketness in a car transferred some of the magic
7271149 demand is our right its our right to be wasteful and profligate the supply is never ending and will take care of itself so an icon that represents a risk free way to increase supply resonates with us
7271150 but theres resistance because that is something you have to do right now
7271151 theres a huge danger if we try to build public policy about risk free iconography and storytelling
7271152 we end up with nuclear waste dumps and ethanol there really is no free lunch but thats a difficult story to tell

7271177 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7271178 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7271179 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7271189 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7271190 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7271191 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7271192 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7271194 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7271195 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7271196 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7271197 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7271198 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7271199 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7271200 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7271201 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

7271207 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7271208 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7271277 job ii 9 a wife in the bosom may be the devils instrument to tempt to sin
7271278 for this i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me
7271279 when josephs mistress tempted him to folly the stronger her temptation was the stronger was his opposition that temptation which the devil uses as a spur to sin god makes a bridle to keep back a christian from it
7271280 lest i should be exalted above measure there was given me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me
7271281 for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted
7271282 and through him we are more than conquerors rom viii 37 thus the evil of temptation is overruled for good coventry ct
7271283 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
7271284 there are three things make a christian prayer meditation and temptation
7271285 st paul in his voyage to rome met with a contrary wind acts xxvii 4 so the wind of temptation is a contrary wind to that of the spirit but god makes use of this cross wind to blow the saints to heaven
7271286 the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinks up my spirits
7271287 in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee
7271288 i will not be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made
7271289 they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him
7271290 ye have taken away my gods and what have i more
7271291 judges xviii 24 so when god is gone what have we more it is not the harp and viol can comfort when god is gone though it be sad to want gods presence yet it is good to lament his absence
7271292 cant iii 3 the deserted soul sends up whole volleys of sighs and groans it knocks at heavens gate by prayer it can have no rest till the golden beams of gods face shine
7271293 for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wrath i hid me
7271294 matt xxvii 46 none can so appreciate christs sufferings none can be so fired with love to christ as those who have been humbled by desertion and have been held over the flames of hell for a time
7271295 rivers of tears run down mine eyes because they keep not thy law
7271296 the wicked have made void thy law therefore i love thy commandments
7271297 god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers etc
7271298 they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and ever
7271299 god would never permit evil if he could not bring good out of evil
7271300 the feeling of sinfullness in the saints works for good several ways
7271301 who shall deliver me from the body of this death
7271302 rom vii 24 a believer carries his sins as a prisoner his shackles oh how does he long for the day of release this sense of sin is good
7271303 if we would judge ourselves we should riot be judged
7271304 it is true satan i am guilty of these sins but i have judged myself already for them and having condemned myself in the lower court of conscience god will acquit me in the upper court of heaven
7271305 what for some is sin others do to the glory of god and the good dr pentecosts remarks notwithstanding i intend to go home tonight and smoke a cigar to the glory of god it is a kind of incense drifting to heaven
7271306 if theres a gun on the wall at the beginning of the play by the end it must go off
7271307 look the agency does many things in many roles from raw intelligence gathering to economic warfare to satellite recon to paramilitary operations requiring cover and deniability to drug smuggling
7271308 every country in the world is betting everything it has on this one hand knowing that after 2007 or 2008 the game ends
7271309 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7271310 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7271311 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7271312 manso 67 was indicted yesterday on charges of possession of a large capacity firearm four counts of possession of a large capacity feeding device four counts of possession of a firearm without proper identification card and three counts of improper storage of a firearm the charges date back to dec 26 when police entered mansos home at 18 longnook road to investigate a burglar alarm they allegedly discovered a browning 22 caliber rifle without a trigger lock an unsecured and loaded smith amp wesson revolver in a desk drawer and a box of 22 caliber ammunition according to court records in the walk in closet in the master bedroom officers found a colt ar 15 assault rifle with a 30 round magazine the guns safety switch was on the fire setting and there were seven rounds in the magazine according to police
7271313 worse for the wear was his ar 15 patrol rifle in his patrol car which he found later was jammed from the scuffle
7271314 then im going to unload on the maggots with my 223 ar 15 my 12 gauge and my glock 17
7271315 its not surprising that the smear peddlers that bankrolled the swift boat lies four years ago on behalf of george bush are once again using old fashioned washington tactics to lie about barack obama on behalf of john mccain
7271316 it goes to sen obamas judgment and the fact that he seems to surround himself with people who hate the united states of america seemed worth exploring
7271317 texas is a breeding ground for this type of dirty politics
7271318 given the legal limits on contributions to presidential candidates bankrolling so called independent attack ads is one way for mega donors to exercise their clout
7271319 common ground the struggle for ownership of the black hills national forest the review has a couple of tidbits but i feel like the book itself might be helpful in underscoring the tensions that led to the creation of the crazy horse monument as a reaction to mount rushmore

7271331 i knew he wasnt right from the moment he got in the car

7271345 kill the remaining survivors in this town and turn them then go out into the countryside and find more disciples slay them they will join us tomorrow in our quest to destroy the wolf for i will destroy him he has thrown down the gauntlet and i will accept his challenge
7271346 make it slow make him suffer the death of a thousand bites leave nothing untouched and when youve finished drive a stake through his heart and carve him into a million pieces i dont want to give all the kings horses and all the kings men a chance to put him together again
7271347 hes blocking me even when hes in his wolf form he has the presence of mind to shield his thoughts the boy is formidable indeed but i will kill him that i vow i will destroy him utterly

7271365 has he not been on the brink of moving and expected to move this week every week for the past few months i do feel for spurs fans though this is alot like the ronaldo saga all over again
7271366 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
7271367 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
7271368 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
7271369 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
7271370 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
7271371 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
7271372 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7271373 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7271374 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
7271375 gerrard has quality he can score the sort of goal he got he has that ability right at the death he has done it before and he will continue to have the mentality to win games at the end
7271376 we sent a lot of players forward the idea was to have many people around their box it does leave us open to a counter attack but it is a gamble we will take
7271377 we know we did not play well but you have to win games like this if you want to be contenders for the title it is a message for everyone for the rest of the season
7271378 its mildly amusing to see the comments of man u fans have you nothing better to do than comment on a liverpool centric story maybe you should be worrying about your own teams inability to turn a poor performance into a win as last week at home to newcastle stevie has a point in seasons gone by we would play badly and lose or draw we havent even got started this season but we have a 100 record
7271379 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7271380 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7271381 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7271382 we had 60 minutes to respond after fulham scored but we did not create a lot and i dont know why
7271383 but lets not make comparisons with this team and last seasons team because it is not a lot different if it is better only the future will tell us that
7271384 it was not excusable to concede a goal like that
7271385 ill always remember it but the most important thing was that it earned us a big three points
7271386 after last week starting with a defeat at hull we really needed something from this game
7271387 oh im going to eat a lot less now and lose weight
7271388 in the beginners mind there are many possibilities in the experts there are few
7271389 you guys have all seen the rubbish thats been written in the papers in the last couple of weeks and its nice to just put it to bed now
7271390 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club and the players are as well because he is a talisman for us
7271391 i think weve spent the last two weeks worrying if he was going to go or if he was going to stay and now we can put it to bed and concentrate on the premier league
7271392 if he wasnt he wouldnt have signed a four year contract so there you go
7271393 he deserved a goal last week against everton and he got his just rewards he could probably have got two or three to be fair
7271394 i just thought it wasnt going to happen and it got to the 75th minute and i thought maybe hed had his time and it was time to throw on someone like benni mccarthy
7271395 but he was awesome and the work he does in holding the ball up causes so much problems i was pleased with his performance for the last two or three weeks he has been different class
7271396 were trying all routes there might be some buys and there might be some loans but i said that six weeks ago and nothing has so far happened
7271397 it is the last days of the sales and there is not much left
7271398 i hope to try and get maybe a couple of players in but for the quality i need us to get to continue forward i dont know if you can get someone with a few days to go
7271399 i need to add mainly midfield and forward players to the squad our defenders today were the reason we got a result
7271400 i feel as if ive let the players down ive got a real good relationship with the players and they know how i work
7271401 i got people like tim cahill mikel arteta joleon lescott phil jagielka leon osman tony hibbert phil neville all to build and have a group together on the understanding im going to progress everton and make them better
7271402 at the moment at this summer im not progressing everton so i feel as if im letting them down
7271403 my ambition is to develop everton every year ive been here i feel i developed this is the first summer where i dont feel ive made any progress
7271404 my ambition is that i want to challenge the top managers in the league
7271405 weve not had massive amounts of money but weve got to the stage now where we require a greater deal if we are going to challenge the liverpools chelseas arsenals manchester uniteds
7271406 that is not withstanding the fact of trying to stay ahead of the aston villas and the tottenhams who are flushed with it money
7271407 im still positive that ill have a new contract to deal with shortly i want to get this week out of the way before the transfer window closes
7271408 there is that much going on now i couldnt put that into the middle of this week on the agenda thats for sure
7271409 the situation is just the same i am fine ill have a contract there is a contract there ive spoken to the chairman bill kenwright when we get around to doing it it is available to do

7271416 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7271417 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through
7271418 how can we know when a message has not been spoken by the lord
7271419 were saying to iraqis baghdad is now safe please come and enjoy yourselves
7271420 we come here to regain some of that peace and calm we lost
7271421 all baghdad is a prison of concrete but not here last year we stayed in our houses and talked to the neighbours through the walls now we can go out and entertain the children
7271422 my vision for this resort i see cafes restaurants shops and kiosks all along the lakeside there
7271423 im going to swim in here why not its more secure than most of baghdad

7271429 it just happened so fast i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
7271430 oh yeah um it is what are those racks on top of your car are they for bikes
7271431 why didnt the chinese govt just give the money to the villagers instead of building that wall looks like they could use it
7271432 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7271433 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7271434 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7271435 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7271436 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7271437 ok then please give me the courtesy i would give you
7271438 i loved it i love mixing it up like that
7271439 i was impressed with his comedy routine and ability to tap dance without music but i was impressed with nothing else about him
7271440 most of us dont agree with him on immigration but i give him credit for trying
7271441 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7271442 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7271443 you cant put eric holder and carolyn kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7271444 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about
7271445 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7271446 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7271447 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7271448 la verdad que si no es por una cosa siempre es por otra
7271449 ya vine dos d as seguidos y me dicen que por el paro no me van a atender yo entiendo que ellos por los m dicos est n reclamando para poder atendernos mejor pero no se dan cuenta que a la larga nos perjudican
7271450 hace unos d as ped turno para el otorrinolaring logo pero me dijeron que la doctora estar de viaje por varias semanas y no me van a poder atender
7271451 es m s me dijeron que est complicado poder hacerme la audiometr a porque el aparato que se usa para ese examen esta en reparaciones y no hay otro
7271452 si lo del audi metro es verdad no me va a quedar otra que hac rmelo en alguna cl nica privada
7271453 shut up just figure it out on your own off
7271454 even in the face of the darkest nights justice will ultimately prevail
7271455 we are investigating further and that investigation is being led by our team in north america they are in control of the systems
7271456 best western took immediate action to disable the compromised log in account in question
7271457 we are currently in the process of working with our credit card partners to ensure that all relevant procedural standards are met and that the interests of our guests are protected
7271458 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7271459 ive never experienced a who is pushing me to come up with more things he can do to advance human rights
7271460 to focus on issues he saw as related to his core value of respecting life getting basic rights for people who were being deprived of them wherever they may be
7271461 they lead to the big cases and they lead to legislation very often
7271462 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7271463 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7271465 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7271466 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7271467 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7271468 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7271469 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7271470 the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries under the carbon market mechanism has been a stormy one among delegates and observers
7271471 there is a point where it will be too late it is better we speed up to make appreciable progress in the negotiations
7271472 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7271473 the negotiations are focusing excessively on finance and not on the root causes of deforestation such as consumption of biofuels meat and timber
7271474 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions
7271475 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7271476 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7271477 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7271478 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7271479 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7271480 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7271481 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7271482 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7271483 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7271484 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7271485 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7271486 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7271487 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7271488 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7271489 who wins the election may wind up depending on whether voters look inward to the economy and fuel prices or outward to world hot spots
7271490 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china
7271491 but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7271492 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7271493 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular
7271494 it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7271495 discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise
7271496 what was the goal of bringing the games to beijing
7271497 if they wanted to bring the games to the most populous nation in the world they succeeded
7271498 if they wanted to help the communist party issue propaganda to its own people they succeeded if it was to improve human rights they failed miserably
7271499 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china
7271500 but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice

7271502 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular

7271504 discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise
7271505 what was the goal of bringing the games to beijing
7271506 if they wanted to bring the games to the most populous nation in the world they succeeded
7271507 if they wanted to help the communist party issue propaganda to its own people they succeeded if it was to improve human rights they failed miserably

7271514 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7271515 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7271516 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7271517 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7271518 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7271519 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7271520 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7271521 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7271522 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7271523 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7271524 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7271525 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7271526 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7271527 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7271528 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7271529 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7271530 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7271531 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7271532 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7271533 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7271534 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7271535 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7271536 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7271537 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7271538 the beijing games is a testament of the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7271539 we havent won gold in eight years a lot of people doubted that nba stars could play together
7271540 after i got into foul trouble early i played a little cautious
7271541 but in the fourth quarter coach k told me to let that momma loose and thats what i tried to do
7271542 its so rewarding to see your hard work pay off
7271543 but kobe and dwyane got the ball and they were hot
7271544 he did not try very hard and his opponent was better than him
7271545 that is soft democratic support voters who are sitting there waiting to go to obama
7271546 if she comes out there and says you need this guy and let me tell you why that will help a lot
7271547 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7271548 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7271549 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7271550 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7271551 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7271552 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7271553 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7271554 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7271555 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7271556 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7271557 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7271558 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7271559 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7271560 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7271561 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7271562 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7271563 those with severe emotional or behavioural disorders who have very great difficulty in forming relationships with others or whose behaviour is so extreme or unpredictable that it causes severe disruption in an ordinary school or inhibits the educational progress of other children
7271564 in practice incompatibility with the efficient education of others is likely to be where pupils present severe challenging behaviour that would significantly disrupt the learning of other pupils or place their safety at risk
7271565 where a school identifies a pupil with a statement of special educational needs who is at serious risk of disaffection or exclusion an interim or early review should be called it will then be possible to consider the pupils changing needs and recommend amendments to the statement as an alternative to the pupil being excluded
7271566 other than in the most exceptional circumstances schools should avoid permanently excluding pupils with statements they should also make every effort to avoid excluding pupils who are being supported at action or school action plus under the special educational needs code of practice including those at school action plus who are being assessed for a statement in most cases the headteacher will be aware that the school is having difficulty managing a pupils behaviour well before the situation has escalated schools should try every practicable means to maintain the pupil in school including seeking la and other professional advice and support at school action plus or where appropriate asking the la to consider carrying out a statutory assessment for a pupil with a statement the school should liaise with their la about initiating an interim review of the pupils statement
7271567 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7271568 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7271569 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7271570 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7271571 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7271572 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7271573 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7271574 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7271575 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
7271576 hell run the 100s test and he doesnt do very well in it but ive seen kids just stop and refuse to do it anymore he never does that he might finish it with a sundial but hes going to finish the race i respect that about him
7271577 that isnt that bad a deal sure he misses a game and probably will need a couple weeks before returning to the lineup but no camp no highrise experience an extra month at home there are worse fates
7271578 better start straightening up and going and doing what hes supposed to do he got a job as a garbage man better get used to it
7271579 some of these guys theyve never worked in their lives
7271580 he said you want me to get a job yeah if you dont make it here you have to get a job so you might as well work you never had a job no kid lives in the middle of newark i went in there and they thought i was some drug dealer or the narcs or something im flabbergasted some of these kids have never had a job
7271581 my job was to chip all the tar off the roof
7271582 he said its a great job it pays 10 bucks an hour forty years 10 bucks an hour was a lot of money and he said were going to be done by 2 oclock in the afternoon so we could go work out we could go party
7271583 so i get up there and its like 5 30 in the morning and john goes over there and hes a tinsmith hes putting up gutters and tapping nails im with the goon squad i have to chip away this stuff typical me if im going to do a job im going to do it right so i go in and im hitting this thing and these other guys are tapping it softly theyre looking at me like im out of my mind about 6 30 that sun rolled up about 10 oclock im done
7271584 tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que digamos a las familias es la verdad

7271591 any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use violence to get what they want that is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion
7271592 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can we have more than 200 cards to address traditional weddings second weddings and interracial weddings
7271593 we heard that our customers wanted the cards so we provided them
7271594 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
7271595 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7271596 in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7271597 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7271598 poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7271599 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
7271600 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
7271601 william laughed and said thank you but about the only way i alter my states these days is organically

7271605 theoretically taking down georgian government sites could have prevented georgia from publicising its side of the conflict however some georgian sites were migrated to new locations more importantly the georgian governments message was getting out to the world
7271606 the nature of the internet is such that it is almost impossible to respond quickly enough
7271607 has confirmed that access to around 30 human rights websites and chinese language news websites is still blocked in china including in the foreign press centres the latest website to be censored is itunes a pro tibetan ngo said this was because the itunes site enabled athletes in beijing to listen to pro tibetan songs
7271608 hmm this stuff looks pretty good i think ill have some right now
7271609 im doing a tap dance what do you think im doing im eating what does it look like
7271610 look im hungry and the food is yummy why dont you have some of yours too itll put you in a better mood
7271611 no way im saving all my stuff until i absolutely have to have some thats the way to do things right sandy
7271612 okay guys everyone out time to hit the nature trail
7271613 how can a person be expected to hike a trail on a packed stomach
7271614 who told you to pack your stomach in the first place
7271615 that last growl was loud enough to wake up a hibernating bear
7271616 but im sort of out of stuff anyway my stomachs still really hurting
7271617 im waiting until i really need to eat something i just wish i had some more energy and my stupid headache would go away
7271618 i cant wait to get back to camp and finally eat something again
7271619 here you might as well take some of my stuff
7271620 i guess i waited too long because in the end i didnt touch a thing
7271621 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7271622 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third which you pay a lot of money for
7271623 there was plenty of good play from us we controlled things for the vast amount of time
7271624 the team looked as if it could go on and win but in a five minute spell we conceded two goals
7271625 he will be praised and beloved and others will desire to emulate him this person has sanctified the almighty
7271626 tell everyone to get on and let those in the back pass up their money or cartisiot
7271627 i set before you a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of god the curse if you do not and you follow other gods
7271628 you will slaughter animals according to the manner i god have prescribed
7271629 you are a nation consecrated to god your lord god has chosen you from all nations on the face of the earth to be his own special nation deut 14 1 2
7271630 see i am placing before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if you will listen to the commandments of the almighty which i am commanding you this day and the curse if you do not listen to the almightys commandments
7271631 he is speaking to everyone else here i dont have to take what he says seriously since he is not really directing his words to me
7271632 and now israel what does god ask from you other than to fear him
7271633 well all that god really wants is that you fear him
7271634 i am going to have a chat with mr cecil and well make a plan during the week we will keep our options open a little while longer
7271635 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
7271636 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
7271637 its like treacle in january at the moment its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
7271638 well wait and see and if we can bring them in then all well and good but if not well go with what weve got now
7271639 hes an old charlton player hes loved by the fans here and his experience and character will add to what weve got
7271640 despite a doubling of efforts in the sale of the 1 000 syndicate tickets sligo rovers have so far only managed to gather 44 000 of their targeted 130 000
7271641 the club is now appealing to all the people of sligo and beyond to come along to fill the showgrounds for our next two home games against drogheda united on august 30 and bohemians on september 5
7271642 we are also asking all those who normally pay the 15 entry fee season ticket holders committee members stewards press and anyone who comes to the next two home games to make a 20 voluntary contribution to the club
7271643 we have already been in contact with horse racing ireland and we will discuss things ourselves and get back in touch with them tomorrow
7271644 what happened last week was a big loser for us and racing on saturday was far from pleasant in the conditions
7271645 but we dont want to go out with a whimper and well probably look for two or three days late in september or early in october and give it one more shot
7271646 we will certainly do our best to salvage what we can for tralee because of what has happened due to the very bad weather
7271647 the pressure is the same when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure the same
7271648 im very happy to be number one its a big satisfaction after a long time being number two but at the same time nothing changes
7271649 this is the last grand slam of the season so its going to be very important for everybody
7271650 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7271651 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7271652 vi er i ferd med spisse oss til d de
7271653 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7271654 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7271655 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7271656 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7271657 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7271658 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7271659 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7271660 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7271661 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7271662 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7271663 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

7271672 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7271673 and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
7271674 sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7271675 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7271676 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7271677 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7271693 we now have the police recognising the involvement of organised crime and we had specific examples of bikie gangs being involved
7271694 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7271695 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7271696 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7271697 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7271698 its part of our approach of mutual responsibility and we think it is an important way to go because its those kids who miss out from regular school attendance who are going to be the most vulnerable across the entire country
7271699 police are investigating an alleged altercation at a premises in cronulla this morning which resulted in a woman sustaining an eye injury
7271700 its only a small minority of parents who fail to do the right thing by their children by ensuring they are enrolled in school and getting the start in life they deserve
7271701 the fact we offer extensive support to parents facing difficult situations means there are no excuses
7271702 its also sensible we act in this way as when a young child isnt attending school it can be a warning sign that there are serious problems at home
7271703 it is sad that court action is the only way to make a small number of parents understand and fulfil their responsibilities
7271704 the department is prosecuting the parents of children as young as six seven and eight if they neglect their responsibilities and fail to ensure their children go to school without an acceptable reason

7271709 als ik verkouden ben geeft dit aan dat ik worstel met problemen die ik niet wil onderkennen door de verkoudheid word ik gedwongen stil te staan bij mezelf en bij wat ik nodig heb op dat moment zo kan ik dus leren om te ontdekken wat ik moet doen om dicht met mezelf in contact te staan ik denk dat ik beperkt word door mijn ziekzijn maar in feite zorgt ziekte voor een eye opener als ik bereid ben datgene te doen wat noodzakelijk is om me prettig te voelen als ik ziek ben kan het gebeuren dat ik me geestelijk makkelijker ontwikkel in de richting die mijn innerlijk met me voorheeft ik hoef dus slechts dat te doen wat goed voor me is als ik me ziek voel
7271710 verkoudheid is een uitgelezen kans om in contact te komen met mezelf en als zodanig geeft deze aan wat een mens nodig heeft in zijn drukke bestaan een mogelijkheid om zich terug te trekken en zich te concentreren op de kern op de essentie van zijn mens zijn namelijk zich ten volle bewust zijn van zichzelf en zijn behoeften
7271711 de reden waarom spullen mankementen gaan vertonen is dat ik er anders tegenover sta dan ik deed toen ik ze maakte of aanschafte als ik mijn mening omtrent een artikel verander verandert ook de energie van het artikel als ik dus merk dat ik een negatieve instelling krijg aangaande een materieel object kan het gebeuren dat het artikel defect raakt of minder goed gaat werken als ik zorg dat mijn houding weer ten positieve verandert en ik werkelijk overtuigd ben van de waarde van het object kan ik het degeneratieproces ten gunste keren
7271712 spullen vertonen bij aanschaf al gebreken wanneer degeen die ze aanschafte zich niet op de juiste wijze heeft ingesteld op het produkt dat hij ging aanschaffen het betreft hierbij zaken aangaande het doel van het produkt of de manier waarop het produkt behoort te werken als mensen deze dingen niet helder hebben voor ze iets aanschaffen zijn er wezenlijke dingen niet duidelijk en kan het universum niet adequaat reageren op wat deze mensen willen dan kan het gebeuren dat iemand iets ontvangt wat hij bij nader inzien niet gekozen zou hebben het is dus van belang om duidelijk te zijn voor mezelf hoe duidelijker ik ben aangaande mijn wensen hoe beter het universum mij van dienst kan zijn
7271713 het is mogelijk dat een artikel niet helemaal naar wens is en het toch uiteindelijk blijkt te voldoen doordat degeen die het bezit accepteert dat hijzelf verantwoordelijk is voor het mankement en berust in het feit dat het artikel niet helemaal zijn smaak is dan omarmt diegeen het object als zijnde een imperfectie van hemzelf en dit heeft altijd positieve gevolgen zowel voor degeen zelf als voor het artikel
7271714 ik heb het me niet gerealiseerd maar de reden die ik eerst had om met mijn weblog bezig te zijn is er momenteel niet meer deze reden was dat ik me wilde uiten op het gebied van taal ik vond het leuk om teksten te bedenken die taalkundig interessant waren ik heb hiertoe nu veel minder behoefte doordat ik contact heb met maria via schrift zij laat mij zien dat het meer om de inhoud gaat dan om virtuoze tekstconstructies nu ik besef dat ik meer met inhoud dan met vorm bezig wil zijn merk ik dat het onderhouden van het weblog mij zwaar valt en ik eigenlijk nog weinig animo ervoor heb ik wil de mensen wel berichten over wat maria vertelt maar veel van wat zij te melden heeft is niet geschikt om openbaar te worden gemaakt waardoor ik eigenlijk niet meer weet wat ik de mensen kan melden het idee om te stoppen met mijn weblog beangstigt me niet ik vind het alleen maar jammer dat de mensen nu niets meer van mij zullen vernemen
7271715 ik heb begrepen dat het nodig is om voor mezelf duidelijk te stellen wat ik wil ik wil regelmatig logjes plaatsen maar slechts dan wanneer ik daartoe werkelijk behoefte voel en niet omdat ik me verplicht voel jegens de vermeende mensen die ze lezen ik hoef me slechts bezig te houden met wat ikzelf wil en niet met de vermeende verwachtingen van anderen jegens mij dan blijft het webloggen ook een bezigheid waar ik met plezier tegenaan kijk en niet een behoefte om te voldoen aan verwachtingen
7271716 als ik merk dat ik zo over een produkt denk dat ik gekocht heb kan ik me afvragen waarom ik me ertoe aangetrokken voelde als ik het alleen maar mooi vind uitzien kan het zijn dat niet mijn ziel maar mijn ego het graag wilde hebben dingen die er alleen mooi uitzien zonder verdere waarde te bezitten zijn niet noodzakelijk om aan te schaffen omdat ik er niet gelukkiger van word maar mij na aankoop zelfs kan realiseren dat ik mij vergist heb in de waarde ervan
7271717 dingen die decoratief van aard zijn kunnen ook meerwaarde krijgen door de achtergrond van het artikel wanneer ik iets weet van de maker kan mij dat doen besluiten dat iets een goede koop is daarom voel ik mij aangetrokken tot zaken waar ik een relatie mee heb mijn ziel spreekt deze dingen aan op hun werkelijke wezenlijke waarde
7271718 mensen kopen deze objecten omdat zij ze associ ren met een bepaalde leefstijl het heeft dus meer te maken met status dan dat het hen iets doet in hun hart als zij zich verdiepen in de aard van het artikel en te weten komen wie het maakt of ontwerpt kan het zijn dat zij werkelijk waardering ervoor krijgen op zielsniveau
7271719 mijn ziel kijkt naar de werkelijke waarde van iets ze bekommert zich om de waarde die mijn gevoel aan iets toekent mijn ego wil niet meer betalen dan nodig is en schat wa ardes op basis van economische gronden
7271720 het is van belang om vast te stellen wat ik wil als ik weet wat ik wil weet ik ook welke keuze de beste voor me is het wilsgevoel komt echter vanuit het ego wanneer ik besef dat niet ik maar de mogelijkheden de keuzebeslissing maken ik hoef dus slechts duidelijk te krijgen wat ik werkelijk van belang vind aan een apparaat dit zorgt ervoor dat het universum mij kan geven wat ik wil

7271764 at the start it was ruled out that she hadnt just walked out the fly screen was cut in a deliberate attempt to take her out that window
7271765 we always hold out hope we will find her alive and one strong line of inquiry is that she is still alive but we also have to consider she may not be alive that line has to be investigated
7271766 i think it is likely a person in the community knows where rahma is or what has happened to her and for whatever reason they havent come forward that was a big factor in offering the 100 000 reward
7271767 i have one boy and one girl and i am very worried about them i put a camera on my house because this has happened to one of my customers
7271768 i know rahmas mum and dad they are beautiful people
7271769 you always asked the customers what happened and nothing it is really sad no one knows anything about it i cant believe it
7271770 there is a possibility we may not find out what happened and i worry how the family will feel if this mystery is never answered
7271771 why dont dutch guys approach women a dutch male on youtube said that the men there dont approach women either a woman approaches them for sex relationship or they buy a prostitute what is up with that way of thinking do they have really low self esteem and fear rejection or a huge ego and expect women to just flock to them either way i think thats really pathetic if its true

7271785 in the early days i became frustrated talking to people about their problems only to realize that there was nothing i could do for them this was a waste of time and i learned a great lesson i didnt get paid for therapy i only got paid when my clients got results results meant closed credit lines and credit cards so i switched my model and never looked back and now i share my secrets in the credit monster

7271792 el 22 de febrero sara baj a desayunar y encontr a dylan y a una mujer llamada malka en la mesa ella dijo que despu s dylan la golpe en la cara y le orden abandonarle
7271793 pas por mi infancia completa no habl con nadie durante al menos una semana
7271794 pens que aquello de hard rain ser a la ltima noticia que tendr a de bob
7271795 luego tuve esa llamada y me pregunt si pod an venir howie y otro par de personas a los ngeles para intentar algo
7271796 bob nos dej sentados cerca de una semana o dos
7271797 nunca aparec a por ah y cuando finalmente se dejaba caer estaba distraido estaba siempre flojo pasaba el d a fumando y estaba de mal humor era distante con la gente y aquello no hubiese salido nunca adelante
7271798 retomar el trabajo de la rolling thunder revue era dif cil
7271799 traje mi guitarra steel para los ensayos y cada vez que la sacaba de la caja bob sol a decir
7271800 sab a que no estar a bien una vez que estuvi ramos de gira
7271801 dylan comenz a imponer una visi n sobre cualquier sonido concebido por los veteranos de la revue con su amor por el r amp b no ser a extra o que hubiera anhelado anteriormente una banda con saxofonista y con coros femeninos la banda que construy dos meses antes del comienzo de su nueva gira comparte algunas similitudes con la gran banda que hab a reunido para desire la combinaci n entre chicas saxof n y teclados tambi n reflejaba elementos de extravagancia que ya presentaba la m sica de elvis en los 70
7271802 recuerdo que hab a tres chicas que cantaban una parte que no pertenec a a nuestro rango vocal y est bamos aterrados con la s la idea de decir algo
7271803 lleg un telegrama del promotor de los conciertos en jap n y en l hac a un manifiesto para que bob tocara unas canciones determinadas en la gira en otras palabras era una jukebox estaba tocando peticiones no quer an que fuese all a hacer nuevos experimentos o que se pusiera a improvisar
7271804 bob ten a en mente hacer algo como lo de elvis presley esa enorme banda y los uniformes l no estaba muy seguro de eso por lo cual no se abri a otras ciudades me refiero a que no fuimos a ning n recinto cerrado de europa o inglaterra o am rica y no le hecho la culpa pienso que l sab a subconscientemente que estaba cometiendo un gran error
7271805 no pude encontrar un buen productor pero era necesario hacerlo as que traimos el equipo y comenzamos y le fuimos a por un sonido en directo
7271806 el mayor problema fue el modo en que lo grabamos
7271807 con bob impacient ndose con los asistentes de sonido imcomprensible y testando niveles y sincronizando sonidos de forma consecuente la m sica est grabada de una forma muy pobre pero ese material sonaba maravilloso en la habitaci n mucho mejor que en budokan
7271808 lindo gesto que te la haya tra do una ex novia de nueva york pero hasta cu ndo con la tacita de superman
7271809 no est s algo grandecita ya para una agenda de la mujer maravilla
7271810 es cierto que un hombre que se pone el slip encima del pantal n como la mayor a de los superh roes no puede ser tomado muy en serio
7271811 c mo es posible que la mayor a de la gente tenga simpat a por ellos cuando estos cumplen un rol policial algo que casi todo el mundo rechaza
7271812 la raz n del amor a los superh roes puede ser que las fantas as que ellos encarnan apelan a necesidades b sicas en nosotros pero tambi n hay elementos oscuros en las fantas as los or genes de los superh roes est n casi siempre basados en un acontecimiento traum tico

7271816 es complicado opacar a los grandes porque el g nero en el que brillan los superh roes mayores tiene cierto p blico asegurado esto permite que la industria maneje los costos y expectativas sin asumir riesgos
7271817 los superh roes fueron tan abarcadores que ha quedado muy poco espacio para el surgimiento de otros
7271818 es siempre m s sencillo actualizar o modernizar la figura de un h roe ya existente que crear uno

7271822 seg n los meteor logos uruguay es un pa s proclive a tornados violentos
7271823 los lugares de mayor frecuencia son colonia florida y san jos pero han habido en otros lugares como en artigas en 1996 en rivera en 1968
7271824 lo que pasa es que la gente que los vive no lo cuenta a los cient ficos que terminamos enter ndonos a trav s de la prensa seguramente hubo muchos m s pero tenemos pocos registros
7271825 al contrario de estados unidos donde el servicio meteorol gico registra exhaustivamente todas las ocurrencias aqu las observaciones recaen m s en aficionados y rganos de prensa
7271826 es muy dif cil medir los vientos as que se analizan los da os y se utiliza la escala que hizo theodoro fujita en estados unidos
7271827 se relevan los da os la orientaci n de los restos se compara con otros eventos en la regi n y se entrevista a los testigos importan hasta los olores un tornado va levantando tierra escombros eso puede dar un indicio sobre la trayectoria en otros eventos la gente dec a que hab a olor a tierra mojada o a azufre ya que por la actividad el ctrica se forma ozono tambi n se alan el ruido como el de un avi n volando bajo o una locomotora
7271828 los fen menos ocurridos corresponden a las intensidades f3 y f4 de lo que se deduce que el viento pudo haber llegado a una velocidad de 400 kil metros por hora
7271829 las chapas de zinc eran lanzadas a gran altura como papelitos
7271830 seg n un recuento personal en base a informaci n publicada en prensa unas 15 personas mueren cada a o por eventos hidro meteorol gicos tormentas severas inundaciones y otros en general por imprudencias
7271831 como los agujeros negros son el misterio para la astronom a los tornados lo son para la meteorolog a no tienen periodicidad no se predicen tornados en ninguna parte del mundo hay 10 teor as distintas sobre la g nesis de los tornados
7271832 se puede decir cu ndo hay condiciones para el desarrollo de tormentas severas que pueden generar piedras de granizo de m s de 2 cent metros de di metro vientos de m s de 90 kil metros por hora o tornados
7271833 es muy dif cil saber si efectivamente se va a formar un tornado
7271834 no existe actualmente en am rica del sur un registro confiable y detallado de eventos de tornados debido a que no hay una concientizaci n p blica al respecto
7271835 cada 21 de abril en cualquier conversaci n sale el tema del tornado hay personas a n hoy que ni bien ven tormentas se encierran en sus domicilios se sigue recordando como si hubiese sido ayer
7271836 no puedo explicarlo pero en ese momento no abr an en medio de todo eso agarramos una puerta a las patadas salimos y nos pusimos contra una pared parec a que no paraba
7271837 el d a estaba con mucho calor y humedad era un d a pesado se estaba formando una tormenta una nube inmensa de grande se ve a muy bien desde la ruta 7 en el kil metro 97
7271838 la tormenta se empez a levantar con rel mpagos continuos en un momento empez a bajar una punta como si fuera un embudo era una cosa rara yo ni sab a de lo que se trataba no ten amos conciencia de lo que se aproximaba como cosa curiosa tom la c mara intent sacarle unas fotos y logr algo se mov a lento en sentido recto hab a muchos nervios porque no se sab a lo que era unos 10 minutos m s tarde ya estaba en el pueblo
7271839 una de la cosas que tiene que quedar clara es que nada se le pod a resistir no dej casa paredes alambrados ni agua en los tajamares yo miraba la tormenta y ve a hojas pero en realidad eran chapas y techos que giraban techos que nunca m s se encontraron en un momento pas la tormenta y fue como una turbulencia en un avi n cuando a uno se le tapan los o dos el olor a azufre era profundo e irritaba las fosas nasales
7271840 para los que lo vivimos ac es algo que est latente cuando se dan grandes tormentas siempre se da a conocer lo que pas a las nuevas generaciones

7271845 the highest score awarded to an olympic dive ever another first how many more firsts can this child get can you find something else to be first in hes just done so well he deserves it
7271846 when i first met him he was pretty unhappy he wasnt liking the diving in brisbane at all he didnt want to do it wasnt happy being there
7271847 it took a lot for him to retire and stop doing it because it had been his life for so long he wanted to try and be happy again he took time to do normal things that people do
7271848 then after five or six months he started to really miss it again and he had the opportunity to dive with chava sobrino his coach he started that and loved it ever since every second of it which is great to see him happy all the time
7271849 he was only hesitant because he was worried about that factor of sponsorship
7271850 it was a bit of a worry but i think everybody has caught up now
7271851 yum yum yum can we have a piece of that
7271852 the biggest thing he was worried about was people paying more attention to that than his actually diving
7271853 and i suppose that kind of did happen a little bit hopefully now it wont be so much of an issue any more
7271854 it was his best dive and thats why we put it at the end
7271855 the expectancy of that dive was around 106 to 108 points but not 112 never he did it at the right time at the right moment in the right pool with the right crowd so im pretty happy and we got the right medal
7271856 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7271857 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we share their joys and their tears and we marvelled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7271858 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict
7271859 keep that sprit alive when you return home these were truly exceptional games
7271860 i dont know if we were intimidated i dont know what happened
7271861 we actually believed we could do it that we could come out and win a gold medal
7271862 to be honest we havent played great all tournament we havent put it together for 40 minutes weve worn teams down over 40 minutes but we havent put it together for 40 minutes and thats a really disappointing result
7271863 the scoreline doesnt really show how good we are and the thing that hurts the most is that what did we get done by 30
7271864 i dont know if penny taylor going down really hurt us because she couldnt play at 100 per cent she was 50 per cent maybe not even that when she did her ankle she did it pretty badly probably an ankle injury that you would sit out for maybe two or three weeks but we had to try and get her back for the final shes a big part of our team and one of the best in the world
7271865 we wanted it we wanted it badly and we knew what we had to do there are no excuses
7271866 theres not one person who is not happy to have a silver medal but obviously you want a gold the minute that game ended our focus went to four years time
7271867 qu es lo que han hecho para merecer a este tipo
7271868 since then the numbers of women in the australian team has gone up to over 40 per cent but they still continue to win the medals at a disproportionately high number
7271869 i cant believe four years has come and gone and were done
7271870 thats another olympics done for us so we really get to enjoy it now and i personally am really proud of what i achieved here and i know everyone on the australian team should be very proud of themselves because we really did a fantastic job and really stood up under pressure

7271880 were not thinking like that right now were thinking sept 4 no 72 is going to be right there at his normal spot at right end
7271881 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7271882 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7271883 the issue is not just whether czechs hungarians and poles join nato the problem is more serious the rejection of the strategy for a new common european system agreed to by myself and all the western leaders when we ended the cold war i feel betrayed by the west the opportunity we seized on behalf of peace has been lost the whole idea of a new world order has been completely abandoned
7271884 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder

7271886 its imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america
7271887 no damos informaci n sobre el estado de los casos hasta que no se terminen de analizar
7271888 el vicente calder n estar lleno y espero que nuestros hinchas no paren de apoyarnos hasta el final para poder lograr el objetivo yo no soy el salvador voy a dejar todo en la cancha para que el equipo se clasifique eso s si las cosas me salen bien ser porque tengo el apoyo de mis compa eros
7271889 ganar la medalla de oro en beijing fue algo impresionante algo nico que no se consigue todos los d as
7271890 adem s estoy contento porque le hice dos goles a brasil y para los argentinos ese partido es un cl sico
7271891 para el partido del mi rcoles voy a llegar en buenas condiciones f sicas en los juegos ol mpicos
7271892 this isnt a press conference to get press this is a press conference to save lives
7271893 you must be hardcore democrats to be listening to this guy from delaware and you dont know who the hell he is
7271894 i can run here and not be a burden on a ticket here
7271895 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7271896 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7271897 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7271898 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7271899 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7271900 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7271901 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7271902 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7271903 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7271904 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7271905 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7271906 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7271907 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7271908 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7271909 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7271910 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7271911 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7271912 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7271913 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7271914 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7271915 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7271916 the most recent productions of the phantom of the opera around the world from vegas to china have had the most fantastic sound systems installing a new system in the london production earlier this year brilliantly brought the flagship production into the 21st century new york will now follow getting the newest and best of them all to ensure state of the art sound for our audiences and enhance one of the biggest orchestras on broadway
7271917 phantom had ground breaking sound when it opened in new york in 1988 and andrew and i have wanted for some time to give our sound system a complete update so that audiences could enjoy the most exciting theatrical sound on broadway
7271918 vista amp seinfeld not that theres anything wrong with that
7271919 if you look at the number of investments you have to imagine that there are 10 times that number of firms who have looked or thought of it just like the number of home buyers who look at a house
7271920 only one person buys the house but a lot of people come to see what the kitchen looks like
7271921 weve had folks from china and japan visit the oilsands in previous years and now weve had some very high profile wealthy people form the u s to go and take a look
7271922 the visit may be somewhat symbolic in a way but i dont expect warren buffett or bill gates to go out and start buying oilsands companies at this point
7271923 i think theyre just going up there to kick the tires and see what its all about
7271924 wed be very surprised if this was a precursor to a major investment on their part especially on the part of warren buffett
7271925 he looks to invest in companies at the bottom of the cycle and theres no reason to believe that were at the bottom of the current commodity price cycle
7271926 its more likely that warren buffett and bill gates were brought to the oilsands area as a form of damage control
7271927 its never too early to start thinking seriously about your finances and setting goals for yourself especially for students who may be taking ownership of their finances for the first time
7271928 money problems can distract students from getting the most out of their education which is why its so important for students to have a plan in place to help them take charge of their financial goals before they start the school year
7271929 we played with great character in one of the great international games in basketball history
7271930 this kind of match is very beneficial not just to basketball in spain but to the whole world
7271931 on behalf of everyone involved in united states basketball we want to thank everyone here for following this tournament and for the class manner of the organizers
7271932 it was the greatest experience in my life and in the lives of the other coaches
7271933 this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7271934 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish and being arrogant and being individuals but what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out here with a big win
7271935 now that i look back at 04 it was a blessing
7271936 we were at americas lowest point in 04 and to be sitting here tonight on top of the world i think we did a hell of a job of putting american basketball back where it is supposed to be
7271937 we need a social license the ok from the community to operate
7271938 it takes a rough patch in the economy like this for people to take a look and see where they can save money
7271939 it is just looking across the whole spectrum and seeing where you can save a few bucks it all adds up
7271940 its known as the latte factor but here in canada its known as the tim hortons factor people who spend four or five dollars a day at tim hortons it can really add up
7271941 look for ways to cut back so you dont feel like you are on a budget
7271942 if you look at what you throw out you arent really further ahead it might be better to purchase in smaller quantities
7271943 its neat and cool to have but its also expensive to have
7271944 if you refinance and get a new mortgage you pay principle and interest on the entire amount from day one however if the purpose of your refinance is to consolidate but not use all of the money at once then set up a line of credit you only pay interest on the amount you borrow at the time you use it
7271945 we want to make sure people dont get into the habit of using their house as an atm machine
7271946 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7271947 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7271948 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7271949 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7271950 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7271951 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7271952 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7271953 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7271954 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7271955 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7271956 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7271957 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7271958 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7271959 indonesian law does not recognize dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age
7271960 no i will not be vice president under any circumstances
7271961 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7271962 i think that the only reason clarence thomas is on the court is because he is black i dont believe he could have won had he been white and the reason is i think it was a cynical ploy by president bush
7271963 true spirituality consists in living moment to moment by the grace of jesus christ
7271964 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of god what is good and acceptable and perfect
7271965 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7271966 you will have complete and free access to gods kingdom keys to open any and every door no more barriers between heaven and earth earth and heaven
7271967 the decay of decency in the modern age the rebellion against law and good faith the treatment of human beings as things as the mere instruments of power and ambition is without a doubt the consequence of the decay of the belief in man as something more than an animal animated by highly conditioned reflexes and chemical reactions for unless man is something more than that he has no rights that anyone is bound to respect and there are no limitations upon his conduct which he is bound to obey
7271968 my uncle terry died earlier this year and hes always told me to believe in myself i want to dedicate this to him and i felt that he was with me during the play off
7271969 it feels pretty good i couldnt get too far ahead of myself i was saying in the morning that if nothing goes well early in the day you cant give up i just hung in there and started to feel more confident coming down the stretch which was surprising
7271970 ive been hitting into bunkers all week and i finally found one that was sitting up perfectly it was the easiest shot i just had to splash it out and hope for the best ive never been that excited
7271971 melbourne uni showed a bit of fight back in the second quarter and even after half time but they really broke down up forward darebin had multiple options to goal
7271972 to start from the pole here for the first time for sure is very nice
7271973 the track here is not very easy especially the surface which is a little bit slippery so to make the perfect lap is always difficult
7271974 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7271975 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7271976 he felipe is going to be hard to beat tomorrow but well certainly push for it
7271977 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7271978 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as were on a street course anything is possible in the race
7271979 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7271980 through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand
7271981 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7271982 as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7271983 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7271984 he realised the player in charge of polishing and keeping the ball clean was his top order batsman asif din and what he did to keep his concentration up was to chew extra strong mints it took a while for word to get around but once it did sales of sweets went through the roof
7271985 i tried asifs confection of choice but couldnt get on with them too dry so i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7271986 i have been a st kilda supporter all my life
7271987 when i was a kid i remember watching harvey i had the no 35 on my back
7271988 so i was hoping to kick a goal so i could do it grab the logo and i was lucky enough to kick one i dont know if he saw it
7271989 we didnt have anyone in the rooms before the game so as to keep it normal and when i went out it really smacked me in the face a bit to see all those guys there i saw some old faces and it made me really glad they would come out here today it meant a lot to me
7271990 i often talked about it with him and i assumed he was foxing as well but no he was actually just absolutely spent but he had that ability to just push again
7271991 the thing that i think is more unrecognised is how competitive he is and how he just hates losing that and how much of a spray he gave the umpires over the years
7271992 behind closed doors we were amazed how well he polled in brownlows not really because of how good he was but the sprays he gave the umpires he was as good a sledger as there was going around
7271993 we played the bears out at waverley in an elimination final in i think 97 and he gave a young michael voss a fair pay that day he was one of the few blokes able to give voss a pay
7271994 we didnt want to play a fifth quarter in the warm up
7271995 i dont kick a lot of goals as you know so it was good to get one and it was at a stage where we were just paddling a little bit
7271996 i was more disappointed with when i snapped it and it got called back it was a definite throw but i thought we got away with it but it is always a good feeling to kick a goal
7271997 we have to pay for the man hours and the paint when we have these incidents
7271998 they used to break lights and destroy trash cans and damage the hockey rink
7271999 continuing to clean up the park and make it as user friendly as possible
7272000 research shows that people who eat breakfast tend to perform better in the morning
7272001 non c affatto lintenzione di rappresentare la morte ma di restituirla sotto forma di estasi durante la quale beatrice seduta su un balcone che affaccia sulla citt viene improvvisamente rapita dalla terra al cielo
7272002 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions will be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7272003 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7272004 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7272005 en el a o sesenta y setenta mi pueblo fue perseguido por los paraguayos campesinos y mataron a mi pueblo y les quitaban los ni os para vender a otras familias ese a o cuando ten a cuatro a os han matado a mis abuelos a mis t os y me llevaron a m viv con esa familia como 15 a os despu s cinco a os viv con otra familia trabajando y despu s de 20 a os volv a conocer otra vez a mi pueblo fui preguntando porque yo sab a que era de paraguay y no conoc a mi pueblo en ese tiempo la iglesia cat lica trabajaba con mi pueblo y a trav s de ellos llegu a encontrar a mi verdaderamente gente
7272006 es un cargo muy especial para los pueblos nativos de paraguay por que es la persona que dirige todos los trabajos y los progresos de la comunidad y hace gestiones con el gobierno en el a o ochenta que llegu a conocer a mi gente era una l der joven y fui ascendiendo de a poco mi liderazgo fui nombrada cacique en el a o 2002 en 2007 deje de ser l der porque me entr en la pol tica y ahora llegue a ser la presidenta de los nativos de paraguay
7272007 mi comunidad se llama chupapou all fue la primera vez que llegu a conocer mi pueblo de ah hemos salido un grupo por defender el medio ambiente hemos buscado nuestras tierras ancestrales hemos luchado en el a o 2000 por una propiedad de 5 000 hect reas pero mi verdadera comunidad se llama quepuby de mi cultura lo que m s aprecio es la armon a entre todos el respeto a las mujeres embarazadas a los abuelos y los ni os
7272008 nuestra cultura no hemos cambiado s lo que hemos cambiado la falta de alimentaci n somos m s enfermos hay algunas personas alcoh licas hay algunos ni os en las calles hay drogadictos el impacto del medio ambiente fue muy grande en los ltimos cinco a os entonces los j venes se desesperaban y emigraron a la ciudad casi todas las comunidades ind genas han sufrido este problema en mi comunidad hasta ahora gracias a dios no hemos salido a la calle
7272009 se opon an porque primeramente me dicen que yo soy mujer hay mucho machismo aqu entre nosotros los pueblos nativos en paraguay y bueno por ser mujer no me lo quer an permitir pero cuando asum el mi rcoles vinieron la mayor a a apoyarme y eso me ayud bastante
7272010 que esta instituci n sea realmente de los pueblos nativos que de aqu surjan los pensamientos y las costumbres sean reivindicadas a trav s del indi que los j venes tengan derecho a estudiar a las universidades que lleguen a ser profesionales y todos los profesionales nativos hasta ahora no tenemos derecho al trabajo ni a un puesto en el gobierno entonces que todo eso sea reivindicado para nosotros
7272011 me duele mucho ver como en argentina por ejemplo en uruguay y tambi n en otros pa ses como nuestros pueblos son violentados o exterminados eso tambi n nos duele mucho aqu no quisi ramos que ning n pueblo nativo vuelva a exterminarse conozco muy poco de la situaci n en colombia
7272012 las leyes deben ser espec ficas para los nativos y para los no nativos
7272013 evo morales est pasando una etapa muy dif cil en la vida no todos humanos somos iguales as como yo lo estoy pasando evo morales lo est pasando tambi n igual no todos los pueblos est n a favor de l tambi n mira que yo no he seguido su carrera no hemos llegado a conocer su caso
7272014 ojal que nosotros abramos las puertas para muchos de nuestros hijos que ahora se est n capacitando y est n llegando a las universidades
7272015 sim n pedro tom la palabra y dijo t eres el mes as el hijo de dios vivo entonces jes s le dijo yo te dar las llaves del reino de los cielos
7272016 t eres el mes as el hijo de dios vivo
7272017 libres de todo impedimento corramos la carrera que se abre ante nosotros fijos los ojos en jes s
7272018 mi mam era de la idea de que quejarse no alimenta ni paga las deudas ella cre a que con trabajo y sacrificio tendr an que venir tiempos mejores y tuvo la raz n
7272019 ella dec a todo lo que t quieras ser lo puedes ser quieres ser astronauta puedes ser astronauta quieres ser doctor puedes ser doctor
7272020 tienen restricciones de cr dito y no pueden endeudarse para pagar por la educaci n
7272021 iluminemos m xico los manifestantes ir n vestidos de blanco y encender n velas para sensibilizar al pa s y a sus l deres sobre la necesidad de hacer algo contra los secuestradores
7272022 lo primero que pens es que ten a que hacer algo antes de que me ocurriera algo as a m o a mi familia se al
7272023 adem s que estas v as generar n mayores espacios p blicos y zonas verdes
7272024 que dejar n sentadas las bases de un desarrollo futurista vial para la ciudad
7272025 ahora dicen que no se ha hecho nada el pr ximo a o dir n que porque todo lo est n haciendo a la vez
7272026 me gusta mucho lo propuesto en el tema de salud hay trabajo en infraestructura educativa pero no propuestas en el tema de calidad el empleo es la gran debilidad del plan y le saldr costoso a la ciudad
7272027 ayer el viernes estuve todo el d a llenando tarros para traer el agua porque la gente lo necesita mucho
7272028 las s banas est n sucias y ella tiene que tener todo muy limpio imag nese sin agua dos d as es muy duro
7272029 aqu el servicio es muy bueno pero sufrimos mucho cuando el agua se va porque son dos d as en los que no sabemos como vamos a tener limpia la casa adem s para cocinar nos toca comprar agua del garraf n
7272030 lo que pasa es que aqu el agua es la mitad de la vida
7272031 vine para llevarles agua a unos familiares que no pueden dejar la casa sola y este nacimiento ha sido la salvaci n para evitar que nos quedemos sin gota de agua
7272032 todo el pueblo ha venido este es un servicio porque algunas veces el tubo se da a y queda esta opci n
7272033 me parece un error porque esta agua es clara y ha sido mucha la gente que se ha ba ado lavado platos cocinado y hasta ahora no se han enfermado
7272034 yo vivo con una persona que est enferma y necesita que las cosas est n muy limpias por eso nos afecta mucho que se da e el tubo del agua pero bueno ojal no se demore mucho el arreglo
7272035 a trav s de una consulta ciudadana que hagan los partidos para buscar cada uno su candidato y ponerlo a consideraci n de la misma coalici n
7272036 no lo ve f cil porque cada partido ya tiene sus cartas el partido de la u se ir a con juan manuel santos cambio radical con germ n vargas lleras y el partido conservador tendr a en la baraja a personajes como noem san n carlos holgu n sardi andr s felipe arias fabio valencia cossio juan camilo restrepo carlos rodado noriega luis alberto moreno o hasta el mismo ex presidente andr s pastrana
7272037 desde que haya unas reglas de juego bien claras y una transparencia en el mecanismo para escoger un candidato estoy seguro de que habr a posibilidades de una unidad de criterio
7272038 desde hace varios meses al interior de la bancada se ha conversado el tema
7272039 lo m s importante y la regla de oro es que el partido que tenga la aspiraci n de tener su propio candidato se someta a una consulta abierta y popular para que el que gane reciba el respaldo de todos
7272040 para que d la confianza y termine agrupando a otros sectores
7272041 there will without a doubt be more cases after the closing of the olympic games
7272042 i do not think there is a system that we do not know nowadays when there is something like this we always hear about it i do not believe in anything magical
7272043 in any case if there were anything that has not been detected we will look for it and we will end up detecting it
7272044 we believe that we have had fewer cases because the deterrent effect has been augmented
7272045 it has become more difficult to cheat because a we have augmented the number of tests from 3 500 in athens to 4 500 now secondly we have also increased the penalties
7272046 tenemos que estar seguros de que lo que digamos a las familias es la verdad
7272047 tal vez legalmente eso puede ser posible el asunto es ver si eso se puede hacer pol ticamente en este gobierno todo puede pasar
7272048 eso no se puede hacer pues los congresistas renunciaron a su fuero
7272049 despu s de aceptada la renuncia por el congreso y ya cumplido creo que es imposible hacer algo al contrario
7272050 no hay nada que hacer no hay ning n tipo de mecanismo legal porque renunciaron de manera libre y espont nea y eso qued en la constancia en las actas en esta legislatura no pueden hacerlo
7272051 lo que nos lleva a pensar que este era el terrorista pues no hay forma de explicar la forma en la que qued el cad ver
7272052 es indudable que la capacidad militar del erg se disminuy de manera significativa por la ofensiva militar si no es as ellos no habr an recapacitado pero tambi n se les ofreci una negociaci n digna estamos interesados en enviar ese mensaje que el gobierno sabe tender la mano aqu hubo una combinaci n de garrote y zanahoria de la pol tica de seguridad democr tica con oferta de di logo
7272053 la desmovilizaci n del erg es muy importante es una estructura peque a pero completa que decide abandonar el camino de la violencia y acogerse a la ley de justicia y paz tenemos una oportunidad muy buena para avanzar en la pacificaci n en choc el suroeste antioque o y risaralda y hacer un trabajo de reparaci n de las v ctimas y muy importante es un camino para que sigan otras estructuras de las farc y el eln ha llegado el momento para que se avance en negociaciones de frentes y de bloques ya que las dirigencias de estos grupos se muestran renuentes a avanzar en el camino de la paz
7272054 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo una an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones hay que enviar un mensaje para que ellos den el paso con confianza pero creemos que es viable la situaci n est madura para que avancemos en ese sentido
7272055 lo que vemos en las farc y el eln es un distanciamiento de las c pulas de lo que sucede en las bases guerrilleras especialmente en las farc hay problemas de comunicaci n dentro del secretariado y sus miembros est n muy alejados de lo que est n viviendo sus hombres en diferentes partes del pa s hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas
7272056 el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos como el acordado con el erg a quienes se les dieron garant as seguridad y condici n de interlocutores que sepan que se les abre camino de la reconciliaci n que permitir a consolidar una presencia el del estado y programas sociales donde ellos hac an presencia ese mensaje no est claro y en ese debemos trabajar
7272057 sabemos que hay temor entre muchos de ellos y sus mandos quieren dejar las armas pero entre ellos no tienen la confianza para plantearlo y es hora que lo hagan que entiendan que el gobierno est dispuesto a brindarles las condiciones para esto es lo mismo que sucedi con karina ella se pudo desmovilizar con toda la estructura pero ten a miedo de decirles a sus hombres y ellos tambi n a ella luego de su entrega vino una seguidilla de desmovilizaciones individuales de esa estructura
7272058 con quienes hemos hablado no tienen claro que pueden hacer una desmovilizaci n colectiva pero deben saber que si se desmovilizan no solo pueden acogerse a justicia y paz y aspirar a una pena alternativa sino tambi n sus compa eros que est n en las c rceles la ley lo permite y si entregan secuestrados pueden recibir beneficios legales adicionales
7272059 hay ese dicho tan m tico que recuerda que es m s f cil recuperarse de un fracaso que de un triunfo es verdad infinitamente m s f cil pues con un triunfo habr amplias oportunidades para cagarla
7272060 de hellboy me gusta que es un tipo com n y corriente que no tiene idea de lo especial que es su trabajo que reacciona como cualquier otro profesional trabaja un poco a rega adientes no es el superh roe imbuido del sue o americano que lucha por la justicia que no comete errores y es siempre recto
7272061 qu hace realmente hombre a un hombre las decisiones no es c mo uno empieza sino c mo termina
7272062 como ex cat lico me plante mi fascinaci n por la idea de d nde est el alma
7272063 me he dado permiso para crear un imaginario m s propio m s barroco la manera de abordar el asunto es m s libre creativamente me he divertido infinitamente m s hay personajes nuevos en la primera hab a cinco dise os de monstruo y del que m s sal an eran seis o siete individuos en sta los dise os son 32 es una pel cula infinitamente m s compleja
7272064 he sido muy cat lico pero la pubertad y las experiencias tr gicas que vives en la calle en m xico te hacen pensar
7272065 me dan miedo todos los absolutos creo que la belleza del conocimiento humano es que es interdisciplinario que hay un momento en que la m sica las matem ticas la poes a se mezclan hay un momento en que las ecuaciones pueden tener una est tica po tica y la ciencia puede sonar como concepto religioso sonar como magia cuando hay alguien fundamentalista que defiende s lo una bandera me da un poco de miedo la belleza del conocimiento humano es que cabe todo
7272066 yo s creo pero porque los he experimentado alguna vez me definir a como un esc ptico pero me han pasado cosas en su momento de joven con un amigo por una carretera de m xico hemos visto lo que creemos muy a ciencia cierta que era un ovni
7272067 la gente cree que uno porque hace esto es un cr dulo total yo no yo me defino como un esc ptico convencido s que tiene que existir una explicaci n profundamente aburrida y cient fica para todo esto yo vi un ovni
7272068 me gustar a tener acceso a una m quina del tiempo para no cagarla tan frecuentemente he procurado no arrepentirme nunca pero estar a perfectamente feliz con una m quina del tiempo que me diera cinco minutos simplemente cinco minutos
7272069 viv a en austin estados unidos hasta hace poco pero en los ltimos cuatro a os no he vivido en un solo lugar fijo estuve en madrid de el retiro pero el ltimo a o y medio en budapest ahora me voy tres a os o cuatro a nueva zelanda a hacer el hobbit tambi n he vivido en los ngeles y en praga

7272079 yo creo que este pa s que ha sufrido tanto tiene que entender que una persona como l fabio le puede prestar un gran servicio en las reformas que est liderando con su dinamismo con su inteligencia con su capacidad de decir las cosas con toda franqueza hay que apoyarlo para que saquemos esas reformas que l ha propuesto que son ampliamente convenientes al pa s

7272128 the peloton broke in half and lars bak and jj haedo were at the wrong end when it happened and later on matthew goss also had to let go of the front group because of a flat at a time where we couldnt reach him in the car because there was a group of 17 riders in between us and him
7272129 in the peloton matti breschel anders lund kasper klostergaard and jurgen van goolen worked really hard to get matti in position for the sprint but they couldnt quite keep up with the big wigs who ended up on the podium but great to see them working together so perfectly

7272142 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7272143 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7272144 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7272145 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

7272149 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7272150 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7272151 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7272152 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7272153 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7272154 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7272155 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7272156 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7272157 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7272158 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7272159 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7272160 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7272161 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7272162 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7272163 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7272164 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7272165 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7272166 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7272167 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7272172 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7272173 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7272174 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7272175 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7272176 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7272177 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7272178 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7272179 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7272180 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7272181 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7272182 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7272183 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7272184 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7272185 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7272186 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7272187 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7272188 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7272189 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7272190 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7272191 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7272192 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7272193 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7272194 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7272195 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7272196 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7272197 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7272198 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7272199 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7272200 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7272201 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7272202 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7272203 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7272204 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7272205 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7272206 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7272207 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7272208 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7272209 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7272210 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7272211 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7272212 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7272213 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7272214 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7272215 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7272216 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7272217 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7272218 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7272223 the two daughters andrea swanson 33 and scheryle patigian 44 contend in a lawsuit over control of the family trust that mr simmons made hundreds of thousands of dollars of contributions in their names without their permission in violation of federal campaign law
7272224 will be consider just in case such actual condition and status of merchandise is specified
7272225 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7272226 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7272227 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7272228 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7272229 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7272230 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7272231 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7272232 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7272233 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7272234 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7272235 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7272236 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7272237 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7272238 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7272239 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7272240 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7272241 its a very intense situation i mean you have officers with their guns out and theyre concerned with a gun battle out in the street
7272242 were assuming that he was here for moms birthday and they decided to do some robberies on moms birthday
7272243 the young boys are obviously traumatized the 10 year old was crying very upset all he really wanted was his batman comic books but really both of the boys knew exactly what was going on
7272244 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7272245 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7272246 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7272247 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7272248 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7272249 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7272250 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7272251 before they only kidnapped well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners
7272252 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
7272253 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
7272254 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7272255 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7272256 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7272257 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7272258 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7272259 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7272260 a persons life has such a great value that we cannot take it we are not the owners
7272261 it is not a philosophical debate it is mostly about the criminality should you or should you not be penalising it
7272262 there isnt a way to measure this what was clandestine is now authorised we dont know what the measure is outside these medical units
7272263 if something happens your family or you have legal grounds to allege negligence
7272264 what this suggests is that procedures in clandestine areas have disappeared and given way to this
7272265 el tiene cierto aire de perfecci n y joe biden es m s sencillo
7272266 un l der experimentado de excepcional vigor y un servidor p blico devoto
7272267 en mi opini n es una afrenta total a la senadora clinton

7272276 we always need to take into consideration the possibility of a large number of teachers not re registering over the next three years
7272277 theres a lot more work to do and a lot more responsibility for the board
7272278 its got nothing to do with the current enterprise bargaining negotiations
7272279 teachers are being actively discouraged from stepping into the classroom with these increases
7272280 asking university graduates to pay that sort of fee it could be something that makes them want to think twice about entering the profession
7272281 either being ill informed or mischievous in trying to politicise the boards decision
7272282 very unfair especially for younger teachers like me who are just starting out
7272283 in the early days of teaching youre on a low wage and also have a huge hecs debt

7272286 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7272287 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
7272288 we were all yelling come on china come on china

7272291 gewonnen haben wir das rennen dann aber im zweiten abschnitt da ist das auto von runde zu runde immer schneller geworden im dritten abschnitt konnte ich das rennen dann ruhig nach hause fahren
7272292 wir m ssen uns anschauen was bei kimi passiert ist denn wir haben keine ahnung ich wei dass kimi der motor geplatzt ist wir m ssen uns dies anschauen und f r das kommende rennen hart arbeiten die zuverl ssigkeit war f r uns ein problem besonders im ersten rennen im vergangenen und in diesem rennen wir m ssen sehr hart arbeiten wir haben bis zum n chsten rennen zwei wochen zeit alle konzentrieren sich intensiv darauf etwaige probleme aus der welt zu schaffen
7272293 wir m ssen nach vorn kommen es liegen noch so viele rennen vor uns nach einem desaster wie wir es in ungarn erlebten bin ich einfach nur gl cklich
7272294 ich habe hinter ihm angehalten und wir haben die boxengasse gemeinsam verlassen
7272295 als er vorbeifuhr fuhren wir seite an seite ich war der f hrende und er das berrundete auto das war nicht sehr clever von ihm er muss mich eigentlich vorbei lassen es war bl d mit ihm k mpfen zu m ssen zumal die mauer pl tzlich sehr nah kam ich habe ihn dann fahren lassen zum gl ck hatte ich gen gend vorsprung
7272296 es ist die alte geschichte ich kam einfach nicht an ihm vorbei und ich habe mich gefragt ob er das mit mir machen w rde und er hat das in der vergangenheit getan so l uft die sache nun einmal
7272297 kyle ist ja kein schlechter verlierer er war nur sauer und ich kann das komplett verstehen
7272298 kyle hatte den ganzen tag das schnellste auto auf den long runs
7272299 beim letzten restart war mein auto superschnell und ich habe ihn ein wenig ber hrt ich zog vorbei und wir haben gewonnen das ist einfach gro artig denn ein bristol sieg ist einfach unbeschreiblich
7272300 fr her in der saison gab es ein nationwide rennen in dem kyle klar schneller war als ich
7272301 kyle ist ja kein schlechter verlierer er war nur sauer und ich kann das komplett verstehen ich h tte wahrscheinlich das gleiche gemacht
7272302 er kam zu mir und sagte dass ich das ernten w rde was ich s he ich sagte zu ihm dass genau das heute passiert ist
7272303 ich denke dass ich jede berechtigung hatte das zu tun was heute passiert ist ich musste es tun denn sonst w re ich nicht an ihm vorbei gekommen lasst mich eines klar stellen ich entschuldige mich nicht daf r ich denke nun steht es unentschieden und es hat ihm mehr gekostet als mich

7272316 el dolor cr nico afecta a una proporci n mayor de mujeres que de hombres pero desafortunadamente las mujeres tambi n son menos propensas a recibir tratamiento en comparaci n con los varones debido a barreras culturales econ micas y pol ticas
7272317 en general las mujeres reciben menos tratamiento analg sico debido en parte a que en la mujer el dolor suele ser atribuido a factores psicol gicos considerados menos o directamente no relevantes
7272318 hay estudios que han mostrado que las mujeres tienen m s dolor recurrente dolor m s severo y dolor por m s tiempo
7272319 las mujeres consultan m s son m s propensas a buscar asistencia m dica en forma voluntaria y a explicar su dolor cuando una mujer llega a la consulta seguro ya hizo dos o tres tratamientos previos por su cuenta el hombre en cambio consulta m s tarde y por patolog as m s severas
7272320 muchos s ndromes de dolor aparecen o desaparecen asociados a cambios hormonales despu s de la pubertad por ejemplo la aparici n de muchos de estos s ndromes se incrementa en las mujeres pero no en los varones
7272321 hay estudios que sugieren que la analgesia inducida por el estr s que es la forma natural en que el organismo reacciona ante el estr s podr a estar suprimida por los estr genos se alaron weissbrod y stronski asimismo cambios hormonales como los del ciclo menstrual el embarazo o la menopausia intervienen en la modulaci n del dolor
7272322 que las hormonas juegan un rol importante ha sido ya demostrado a trav s de distintos estudios en los que se observ que cambiar los niveles de hormonas en sangre en hombres y en mujeres cambia tambi n la frecuencia de aparici n de s ndromes como los dolores de cabeza
7272323 la doctora aloisi realiz un estudio en personas transexuales de ambos sexos que tomaban hormonas masculinas andr genos o femeninas coment el doctor luis c mera presidente de la sociedad argentina de medicina y hall que las mujeres transexuales padec an m s dolor cr nico que los varones transexuales pero al tomar andr genos el dolor disminuy a la mitad mientras que en los varones su incidencia aument al tomar estr genos
7272324 hay que tener en cuenta que la mujer suele vivir m s y va acumulando problemas de salud que generan dolor como la artrosis apuntaron weissbrod y stronski adem s la composici n del cuerpo porcentaje de grasa agua m sculo tambi n hace que las drogas act en de forma diferente
7272325 se ha observado por ejemplo que un tipo de opioides los kappa parecer an tener un mayor efecto analg sico en las mujeres mientras que en los varones las dosis bajas tendr an incluso un efecto antianalg sico dijo lupi pero hay que tener en cuenta que reci n se est empezando a estudiar estos temas

7272332 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7272333 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7272334 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7272335 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7272336 i have got into a lot more goalscoring opportunities during pre season but didnt manage to score
7272337 but the mere fact i was getting into the right positions was a good sign
7272338 that is what you fight every day in training for you want to try and improve and you achieve that by pitting yourself against the best
7272339 but it is not going to be easy you dont get many harder games than a trip to fratton park we have had some poor results down there over the past few years
7272340 it is something we are looking to rectify because we have a run of three away games around the super cup and internationals
7272341 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7272342 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7272343 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7272344 but lets not make comparisons with this team and last seasons team because it is not a lot different if it is better only the future will tell us that
7272345 it was not excusable to concede a goal like that
7272346 ill always remember it but the most important thing was that it earned us a big three points
7272347 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
7272348 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
7272349 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
7272350 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
7272351 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
7272352 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
7272353 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7272354 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7272355 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
7272356 gerrard has quality he can score the sort of goal he got he has that ability right at the death he has done it before and he will continue to have the mentality to win games at the end
7272357 we sent a lot of players forward the idea was to have many people around their box it does leave us open to a counter attack but it is a gamble we will take
7272358 we know we did not play well but you have to win games like this if you want to be contenders for the title it is a message for everyone for the rest of the season
7272359 got a phonecall with a really creepy guy saying her name after a long pause
7272360 when we reached the site of the slaughter pen on our driving tour we stopped the car in a small parking area to take a look around in the woods beyond the open field i noticed a small light appear and bob along at the edge of the trees i could see nothing behind it in the gloom and only saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared and did not return

7272365 only about 30 of the energy transmitted actually reaches the device
7272366 in colorado tesla carried out various long distance power transmission experiments tesla effect is the application of a type of electrical conduction that is the movement of energy through space and matter not just the production of voltage across a conductor through longitudinal waves tesla transferred energy to receiving devices he sent electrostatic forces through natural media across a conductor situated in the changing magnetic flux and transferred power to a conducting receiving device such as teslas wireless bulbs
7272367 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7272368 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
7272369 electromagnetism electric current produces a magnetic field the magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire electric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer but this method involves breaking the circuit which is sometimes inconvenient current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current devices used for this include hall effect sensors current clamps current transformers and rogowski coils
7272370 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields

7272405 if al sadr declares himself a marjaa too soon or under unsuitable circumstances even a hint from al sistani that questions his credentials will stick to him for years
7272406 the conditions must be perfect and thats why al sadr decided to focus on his studies for many years

7272408 we understand what is behind russias position we believe this is a response to georgian provocation we support moscow in this and are against any attempts to blacken russia
7272409 to consider the offers of the syrian government in connection to the delivery of new weapons only for defence purposes
7272410 we are not going to slam the door on nato nato could slam this door though everything depends on natos priorities if the priorities are absolutely supportive of saakashvilis bankrupt regime to the detriment of partnership with russia then it is not our fault
7272411 people say i have an honest face but now i make it like stone
7272412 there used to be lots of grupirovki for example one group would go to a shop owner demand protection money but when another mafia group would come around the owner would tell them whom he was paying the money to the groups would then sort it out among themselves
7272413 it was like a war zone everyone ran to the shops to buy something before the ruble became worthless it went down in value 30 times in a week but then it stayed like that for three years and we got used to it
7272414 but im from the south and i wonder where are the terrorists bush and two sides of the same coin
7272415 well before in russia it was never necessary to report to owners only to do tax audits
7272416 but now that foreign partners are involved we have to report to stockholders
7272417 im lucky if i get out of here by 10
7272418 but i never had to speak english before now i say nothing
7272419 no the british people tell me they are used to leaving at 5 i think its the american style

7272421 russian tax code is very complicated for each item you have to provide long explanations the explanations can be read in many ways

7272425 if you could see villa somalia the presidents headquarters in mogadishu you would see that its like a corrupt ngo with ethiopian troops guarding it
7272426 i think many countries not only african countries we dont have the best presidents
7272427 i am sorry we have to give them a break very often i have tears in my eyes when i meet prominent somalis we are just putting the blame on these unfortunate people we have to give them a hand
7272428 publicizing deliberately invented stories about the activities of ethiopian troops
7272429 to me this is not a problem i will not get into the name game
7272430 how can i fund a number of guys who created a court who refused to announce an administration who refused to subscribe to dialogue with the existing administration and were totally hijacked by their extremists no way
7272431 this government is from our point of view a small shadow of light or a way out of this hell that is modern day somalia
7272432 the u n security council would only allow the islamic courts union so long as they mediated with the transitional federal government

7272435 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7272436 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7272437 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7272438 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7272439 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7272440 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7272441 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7272442 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7272443 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7272444 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7272445 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7272446 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7272447 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
7272448 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7272449 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7272450 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7272451 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7272452 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7272453 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7272454 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7272455 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7272456 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7272457 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7272458 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7272459 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7272460 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
7272461 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7272462 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7272463 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7272464 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7272465 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7272466 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7272467 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7272468 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7272469 its iran its the u n its all the counterterrorism and counternarcotics programs syria venezuela hamas there are any number of issues over which they can be less cooperative than theyve been
7272470 the potential is big because at the end of the day they are the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7272471 natos defeat in afghanistan would not be good for us
7272472 worry is not a policy indignation is not a policy even though outrage worry and indignation are all appropriate in this situation they shouldnt be mistaken for policy and they shouldnt be mistaken for strategy
7272473 said celeste a wallander a russia scholar at georgetowns school of foreign service
7272474 if russias feeling churlish they can pretty much bring to a grinding halt any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7272475 ironically since the collapse of the soviet union theres always been the concern about russia becoming a spoiler
7272476 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
7272477 at least they could then react quickly if there was an attack
7272478 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
7272479 the russian army has shown that it is far more deployable than in the 90s able to get frontline troops in and out in a short space of time
7272480 foreigners are pulling out of some assets and stock markets and the exchange rate has suffered most i think we have come close to the bottom now
7272481 the million headed hydra of the bourgeoisie has sent a signal change your course comrades
7272482 there is nothing that has happened that could cause us to change any of our plans
7272483 the major achilles heel of the russian market is that there is very little domestic long term capital
7272484 the fighting in georgia was not a warning about some new drift into great power confrontation or a new cold war it is a reminder that the world is not shaped by democratic values international law good intentions globalism rational bargains or the search for dialogue
7272485 all of these elements do play an important role but the classic power politics are just as real as ever nation states still have the guns and missiles more powerful states will bend or break the rules when they feel it is in their interest to do so and when there is no opposing power bloc that can pose a convincing threat
7272486 at least a country not just a bridge too far

7272500 although many of the industry players are facing problems caused by private servers even today we have already employed necessary measures to mitigate the effect and are confident that our operations and business performance will be less affected

7272509 thankyou for the new trail amp all the upkeep its nice
7272510 i now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal and i set about filling the notebooks with odd facts stories from the past and all sorts of other things including the most trivial material on the whole i concentrated on things and people that i found charming and splendid
7272511 it is too much we tried to repair the car for the fans so i could race but it is too much and that is it
7272512 i can remember going to nancys workshops years ago and listening to all the information and being completely overwhelmed but remembering nancys gentle approach and saying
7272513 dobbiamo trovare assolutamente un accordo a ogni costo entro settembre
7272514 this gal is serious about her crafts look at all the books about scrapbooking
7272515 i had other things i decided i either had to do or wanted to do
7272516 has it really been over a month since ive posted
7272517 aeg lives clout in the talent marketplace will enable the foundation to bring intelligent entertainers like judy collins to poway that we could not afford to book on our own
7272518 our new partnership is unprecedented and represents a match made in heaven
7272519 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7272520 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7272521 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7272522 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7272523 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7272524 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
7272525 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity
7272526 and later in chapter 4 the word is used again and this time it is
7272527 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called 2 with all lowliness and gentleness with longsuffering bearing with one another in love 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
7272528 and he himself gave some to be apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry for the edifying of the body of christ 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ 14 that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things into him who is the head christ 16 from whom the whole body joined and knit together by what every joint supplies according to the effective working by which every part does its share causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love
7272529 in the unity discussions have you in fact far too often the opposite is true thus we cant get along with each other carnal christians whose motives are fleshly are going to fight
7272530 and of the knowledge of the son of god and that we become mature so that we are like christ
7272531 from whom the whole body joined and knit together by what every joint supplies according to the effective working by which every part does its share causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love
7272532 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7272533 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third which you pay a lot of money for
7272534 there was plenty of good play from us we controlled things for the vast amount of time
7272535 the team looked as if it could go on and win but in a five minute spell we conceded two goals maybe that is the difference at this level
7272536 listen to me young man i demand to be put through immediately
7272537 krieg ums kaspische l mit waffengewalt wollen westliche multis die russische vorherrschaft ber die gigantischen vorkommen brechen
7272538 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
7272539 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
7272540 they sing those fucking stupid ass songs and theyre shitty tippers and my last names omalley
7272541 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7272542 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7272543 ik denk dat je gelijk hebt het is inderdaad de caribbean daar
7272544 weet u misschien of er hier in de buurt geld te verdienen is
7272545 de haven meester zei niet s maar bekeek de 2 meiden eens goed
7272546 mmm misschien moet ik er eens goed over nadenken maar ik kan jullie
7272547 its a grim situation there is no doubt about it
7272548 but we will continue to make efforts to hold the tournament next month and will fight till the end
7272549 if a decision is made by the governing body to move the tournament out of pakistan then we reserve the right to boycott the icc champions trophy
7272550 sou um guardador de rebanhos o rebanho os meus pensamentos e os meus pensamentos s o todos sensa es penso com os olhos e com os ouvidos e com as m os e os p s e com o nariz e a boca pensar uma flor v la e cheir la e comer um fruto saber lhe o sentido por isso quando num dia de calor me sinto triste de goz lo tanto e me deito ao comprido na erva e fecho os olhos quentes sinto todo o meu corpo deitado na realidade sei a verdade e sou feliz pensar em deus desobedecer a deus porque deus quis que o n o conhec ssemos por isso se nos n o mostrou sejamos simples e calmos como os regatos e as rvores e deus amar nos fazendo de n s belos como as rvores e os regatos e dar nos verdor na sua primavera e um rio aonde ir ter quando acabemos
7272551 non stavano uscendo da una stazione parole che riaccendono la polemica tra il pd e il primo cittadino della capitale paola picierno ministro ombra delle politiche givanili lasciano sconcertati le dichiarazioni del sindaco che con una faccia tosta incredibile quasi scarica sui due poveri turisti olandesi a cui rinnoviamo la nostra solidariet la responsabilit dellaggressione subita e la stessa mentalit assurda di coloro che arrivano a rinfacciare alle donne stuprate di aver in qualche modo provocato i loro aguzzini
7272552 non si deve fare demagogia sullinsicurezza dando la colpa ai cittadini o ai turisti non si pu istillare lidea che se si mette una tenda a piazza venezia si ha diritto alla protezione magari alla presenza dei militari mentre ponte galeria terra di nessuno questo contraddice la asserita e mai dimostrata attenzione della destra alle periferie romane o alemanno pensa di difendere solo i parioli e il centro della citt
7272553 gli italiani e i romani sono stati presi in giro dal sindaco che non sa neanche assumersi le responsabilit del caso e grave che oggi alemanno finisca con lattribuire parte della colpa di quanto accaduto ai due turisti olandesi
7272554 non siamo stati daccordo con molte delle azioni del comune di roma ma indecente lattacco della sinistra al sindaco su quanto accaduto ai due olandesi aggrediti quanti criticano andrebbero allestero a campeggiare in un posto isolato e privo di controlli ci vuole pi seriet anche quando si contesta
7272555 revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most
7272556 shawshank redemption and the bucket list delivers two memorable questions that according to egyptian legend each person is asked when they die to determine where they go
7272557 we gaven onze zaak de naam carroesel omdat in de woning van de kunstenaar een paardje in papier mach stond dat vroeger op een echte kindermolen was gemonteerd we mochten dat van zoon kenneth smith behouden
7272558 corporate sell out thats the first thing you think of right
7272559 when they first approached us and asked if we were interested we said ummmm not really
7272560 we were really skeptical at first but now we feel its a real partnership one of our goals is to always always looking for a new audience and this was an audience we would never ever get into the gallery by any other means so we just decided to jump into it
7272561 i think theyre hoping my mailing list is their target market but maybe they dont realize that most of my friends are artists and dont have any money
7272562 whenever an opportunity presents itself you get excited because they can be hard come by
7272563 but then i realized certain aspects of this needed to be carefully considered
7272564 we looked into areas we thought were relevant to 25 to 35 year olds
7272565 we were thinking interior design or cooking maybe because people that age are big into cooking and then this came up
7272566 its that great mix of grittiness and condos going up full of young professionals
7272567 when you started seeing all the starbucks go in you knew the time was right
7272568 we told them straight out there wouldnt be a volvo logo on their pieces
7272569 if they wanted to do a piece that said cars were environmentally bad then go for it
7272570 it was a sticky situation i thought if i have a volvo in my piece thats explicitly an ad and i wasnt comfortable with that
7272571 we didnt want to go to them and say hey we want to use your art to sell cars
7272572 some of the suits were completely attracted to andrews paintings
7272573 it is all about just being open and honest about what i want
7272574 well sailed nina i congratulate you i am the king of spain
7272575 why would anyone want to take off on a boat and sail half way around the world
7272576 gah stupid computer why did you have to crash at this moment just when im writing a speech for the malls opening tomorrow
7272577 hey hey hey what on earth do you think you are doing
7272578 wait errr thanks what did you just do to my computer
7272579 if you look at what you have in life you will always have more if you look at what you do not have in life you will never have enough

7272581 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this evening
7272582 oh yes fill the churches with dirty thoughts write letters in dead languages to people youve never met burn your credit cards and wear high heels asylum doors stand open divine madness let there be ecstasy ecstasy in the streets laugh and the world laughs with you
7272583 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7272584 the crops die farmers then have to plough and plant again
7272585 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7272586 rivers are drying out where we get water and fish
7272587 the walk to collect water is increasing as wells dry up
7272588 it is very easy to forget the human dimension there are people today whose lives are being disrupted by climate change
7272589 were not going to enter into a bidding war with a pg amp e pacific gas amp electric in san francisco or a southern california edison
7272590 whats cost effective for them is not cost effective for us
7272591 youre seeing premiums of 10 to 20 a megawatt hour
7272592 we have made it a priority to develop or procure renewable energy
7272593 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
7272594 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years
7272595 the mission of the world bank group is to alleviate poverty and one way it does that is to increase access to energy
7272596 they are emitting increasingly large quantities of greenhouse gases which has consequences for the entire global climate
7272597 the oil industry certainly does not need soft loans from a multilateral poverty reduction agency
7272598 the private sector can do this perfectly well on its own
7272599 meet the challenge of climate change without slowing the growth that will help overcome poverty
7272600 go and get my cassock will you and fetch me some coffee while youre out you know how i like it
7272601 holiness what you ask of me is impossible even my fellow superiors agree with me
7272602 the archbishops of los angeles and detroit are in full agreement with me father franco along with the rest of the college
7272603 holy mother give me more time the swiss guards training is taking far longer than i had expected forgive me
7272604 keep me informed of the corps at all times if we cant return glory to the church by peacful means we shall by war good day to you father franco
7272605 mel and stephen wanted a lavish do to celebrate their relationship they agreed to allow the event to be covered by a magazine but are obliged to fulfil certain requirements
7272606 one of these is a certain quota of well known faces family and close friends simply wont do
7272607 most of her friends now are american and mel keeps herself away from the showbiz scene in london and she has felt slightly pressured into inviting celebs shes not actually met
7272608 the future president of the united states just like his predecessors will exclusively defend the interests of his country economically and diplomatically so much the better if those interests happen to coincide with those of europe too bad if this isnt the case paris london or berlin will never stop washington from doing what it pleases there remains however some hope or at least wishes for example that the america of a john mccain or a barack obama changes its tone that she stops constantly pushing for vain confrontations in the name of defending democracy which is always trotted out whenever its economic interests mainly oil need preservation and that it treats its european allies as partners one can always dream
7272609 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7272610 hillary clinton has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7272611 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7272612 the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries under the carbon market mechanism has been a stormy one among delegates and observers
7272613 there is a point where it will be too late it is better we speed up to make appreciable progress in the negotiations
7272614 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7272615 the negotiations are focusing excessively on finance and not on the root causes of deforestation such as consumption of biofuels meat and timber
7272616 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions
7272617 it gave me the wish to fly around the world with no fuel
7272618 if you could fly around the world without the fear of running out of fuel you would have a freedom that is almost perpetual
7272619 they showed mostly the limits of solar energy rather than the potential
7272620 to fly day and night we need a very efficient aircraft
7272621 i think it will be a challenge you have to make all the parts small enough and light enough but if they can do that it will fly
7272622 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7272623 this entry was posted on 2008 08 24 at 3 50 pm and is filed under
7272624 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7272625 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7272626 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7272627 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7272628 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7272629 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7272630 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7272631 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7272632 you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
7272633 but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
7272634 for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same
7272635 if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same
7272636 therefore you are to be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
7272637 were trying to hold the line against the invasion of the douglas fir
7272638 this is the most outstanding example of white oak distribution pretty much anywhere
7272639 in the absence of management this would have been a closed canopy douglas fir forest
7272640 that park is full of dead fuel and dead fuels ignite more easily than live fuels
7272641 our concern was that many of these oak woodlands were going to be converted to be douglas fir forests
7272642 are probably the most important california landscape as far as biodiversity is concerned
7272643 but when were dealing with ecological systems i think we have to take a long view what do want it to look like when our grandchildren use it and if we let it go to douglas fir it wont be much of a park for them
7272644 adds great strength for the experience he brings to the ticket especially in foreign policy
7272645 its very clear that the american public is asking for two things change the kind of change that supports and protects and they are also asking for stability
7272646 dont want strange and odd debacles like hurricane katrina where people certainly needed support and assistance and didnt get it
7272647 it was wise to make sure there was a complementary force for stability a force based on tremendous knowledge and experience the seasoned quality of joe biden i think is something that nobody can question
7272648 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
7272649 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7272650 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7272651 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7272652 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7272653 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7272654 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7272655 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7272656 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7272657 harry will probably go out to let off some steam now hes back home but he has said his boujis nights are numbered
7272658 he and his grandfather are very close and harry is determined that prince philip knows how seriously he takes his role
7272659 harry has said he is busy planning the next step of his military career and wants to continue doing charity work in africa
7272660 philip sees a lot of himself in harry he loves his get up and go his love of the army and his sense of humour
7272661 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7272662 i have not selected him as i do not think that he was focused enough and i did not feel that he would be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7272663 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7272664 when you are playing well you feel comfortable on all courts
7272665 in the past when i was playing well i did well on hard courts too i feel good for sure i won two tournaments in toronto and the olympics and i played semi finals in cincinnati
7272666 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7272667 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7272668 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7272669 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7272670 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7272671 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7272672 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7272673 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7272674 our field records will be perhaps the most valuable of all our results you cant tell in advance which observations will prove valuable do record them all
7272675 climate is the culprit i dont think there is any iota of reason not to think that
7272676 eventually its going to get shoved off these mountains and go extinct
7272677 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
7272678 wed be sitting in camp and wed both be skinning pretty soon hed throw a rat over to me and hed say here russell finish this one up and hed just pick up his notebook and start writing
7272679 we never traveled one inch but what he had that notebook open and writing notes
7272680 have just heard the loud hard clattering call of a belted kingfisher as i sat down four deer were walking about the doe has now just gotten excited and given eight rather loud snorts in irregular succession
7272681 at 7 000 feet heard a very loud pounding i followed the racket and came across a pileated woodpecker
7272682 the beauty of the field notes is they describe in great detail where grinnell was camping and where he set his trap lines
7272683 we can often go to the exact same place and see whats there now
7272684 historic records for yosemite indicate theres been about a five degree fahrenheit increase in the maximum summer temperature for any given elevation
7272685 now if you happen to see one you consider yourself pretty lucky
7272686 if you read their notes they saw it every day
7272687 were never going to learn about the biology of the animal here in yosemite because we cant find them
7272688 when we got here it was like somebody put a battery in him
7272689 he just goes and then stops and waits for everybody else
7272690 he knows more about these squirrels and chipmunks than anybody else in the world period
7272691 they think i must be writing a paper or i have a degree
7272692 but its just sheer curiosity every year i see something that will catch my interest and i try to learn a little more about it
7272693 for the past quite a few years i have not seen a one
7272694 you could sit quietly and picas would come out and carry on their activities all around you
7272695 this afternoon i noted some alpine chipmunks feasting on a sandwich i had thrown out
7272696 it involves changing rainfall patterns changes in the timing and deposition in the amount of snow
7272697 we know chipmunks feed a lot on seeds if we have a change in the pattern of snow deposition theres a good likelihood well see changes in the distribution of plants
7272698 if that happens the plants they rely on may go away
7272699 the largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on earth
7272700 before we can make decisions about our future use of oil and gas and related decisions about protecting endangered species native communities and the health of our planet we need to know whats out there
7272701 the largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on earth
7272702 before we can make decisions about our future use of oil and gas and related decisions about protecting endangered species native communities and the health of our planet we need to know whats out there
7272703 the world banks lending record does not match up to zoellicks rhetoric
7272704 the institution is simply not slowing down its significant funding to fossil fuel projects that will emit greenhouse gases for 20 to 40 years

7272711 the crops die farmers then have to plough and plant again
7272712 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7272713 rivers are drying out where we get water and fish
7272714 the walk to collect water is increasing as wells dry up
7272715 it is very easy to forget the human dimension there are people today whose lives are being disrupted by climate change
7272716 were not going to enter into a bidding war with a pg amp e pacific gas amp electric in san francisco or a southern california edison
7272717 whats cost effective for them is not cost effective for us
7272718 youre seeing premiums of 10 to 20 a megawatt hour
7272719 we have made it a priority to develop or procure renewable energy
7272720 our field records will be perhaps the most valuable of all our results you cant tell in advance which observations will prove valuable do record them all
7272721 climate is the culprit i dont think there is any iota of reason not to think that
7272722 eventually its going to get shoved off these mountains and go extinct
7272723 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
7272724 wed be sitting in camp and wed both be skinning pretty soon hed throw a rat over to me and hed say here russell finish this one up and hed just pick up his notebook and start writing
7272725 we never traveled one inch but what he had that notebook open and writing notes
7272726 have just heard the loud hard clattering call of a belted kingfisher as i sat down four deer were walking about the doe has now just gotten excited and given eight rather loud snorts in irregular succession
7272727 at 7 000 feet heard a very loud pounding i followed the racket and came across a pileated woodpecker
7272728 the beauty of the field notes is they describe in great detail where grinnell was camping and where he set his trap lines
7272729 we can often go to the exact same place and see whats there now
7272730 historic records for yosemite indicate theres been about a five degree fahrenheit increase in the maximum summer temperature for any given elevation
7272731 now if you happen to see one you consider yourself pretty lucky
7272732 if you read their notes they saw it every day
7272733 were never going to learn about the biology of the animal here in yosemite because we cant find them
7272734 when we got here it was like somebody put a battery in him
7272735 he just goes and then stops and waits for everybody else
7272736 he knows more about these squirrels and chipmunks than anybody else in the world period
7272737 they think i must be writing a paper or i have a degree
7272738 but its just sheer curiosity every year i see something that will catch my interest and i try to learn a little more about it
7272739 for the past quite a few years i have not seen a one
7272740 you could sit quietly and picas would come out and carry on their activities all around you
7272741 this afternoon i noted some alpine chipmunks feasting on a sandwich i had thrown out
7272742 it involves changing rainfall patterns changes in the timing and deposition in the amount of snow
7272743 we know chipmunks feed a lot on seeds if we have a change in the pattern of snow deposition theres a good likelihood well see changes in the distribution of plants
7272744 if that happens the plants they rely on may go away
7272745 it gave me the wish to fly around the world with no fuel
7272746 if you could fly around the world without the fear of running out of fuel you would have a freedom that is almost perpetual
7272747 they showed mostly the limits of solar energy rather than the potential
7272748 to fly day and night we need a very efficient aircraft
7272749 i think it will be a challenge you have to make all the parts small enough and light enough but if they can do that it will fly
7272750 for us it is very important that both people have their own thing going on and that there is a lot of time for yourself
7272751 is the most romantic guy on the planet i will come home and there will be a bouquet of flowers and hell force me to eat this fantastic bowl of pasta it is so wonderful
7272752 two things are enabling us to establish this new paradigm
7272753 first is the advancement in microelectronics which provides us greater density and speed at much lower power consumption than ever before the other is a better understanding of neuroscience and how the brain functions at the synaptic neuronal network and system levels
7272754 the follow on phases of the project will create a technology that functions like the brain of a cat which comprises 108 neurons and 1012 synapses
7272755 the human brain has roughly 1011 neurons and 1015 synapses
7272756 cc has thrown an average of 13 7 pitches per inning
7272757 where guys get in trouble is the 20 25 and 30 pitch innings cc has none of those we set up the rotation for cc and benny sheets to have those types of night
7272758 when youre out there you dont really feel like youre tired or anything like that
7272759 im confident to where i can make my pitches and i can get ground balls and a strikeout if i need to

7272808 one who is deprived of his or her full humanity being taken care of in a very patronizing way
7272809 the customary image of the victim is that of an innocent ignorant child or woman paying the price for political ideological power struggles is there anything more non ideological than this pain of the other in its naked mute palpable presence this perplexed gaze of a starved or wounded child who just stares into the camera lost and unaware of what is going on around them is today the sublime image that cancels out all other images
7272810 the ideal subject victim is a political subject without a clear agenda a subject of helpless suffering sympathizing with all suffering sides in the conflict caught up in a madness of a local clash that can be pacified only by the intervention of a benevolent power
7272811 the other to be protected is good insofar as it remains a victim the moment it no longer behaves like a victim but wants to strike back on its own it magically turns all of a sudden into a terrorist fundamentalist drug trafficking other
7272812 multicultural perception of mindanao as the terrain of ethnic horrors and intolerance of primitive irrational warring passions to be opposed to the post nation state liberal democratic process of solving conflicts through rational negotiation compromise and mutual respect here racism is as it were elevated to the second power it is attributed to the other while we occupy the convenient position of a neutral benevolent observer righteously dismayed at the horrors going on down there

7272814 theft of enjoyment can further explain the surprising hatred of many conservative filipinos against the moros zizek writes
7272815 we always impute to the other an excessive enjoyment he wants to steal our enjoyment by ruining our way of life and or he has access to some secret perverse enjoyment
7272816 what bothers us in the other is that he appears to enjoy a privileged relationship to the object the other either possesses the object treasure having snatched it away from us which is why we dont have it or poses a threat to our possession of the object
7272817 traumatic fact that we never possessed what was allegedly stolen from us
7272818 a kind of ideological fossil created retroactively by the ruling ideology in order to blur its present antagonism

7272833 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships
7272834 organ donation even if it involves valuable consideration may make life better for both parties who find no way out of problems of health or poverty if the state and the altruists cannot help the poor in overcoming their problems it ought not to raise more barriers for them

7272836 sundays thats the only fun part about the nfl to me
7272837 throughout the week its a job in the off season its a job everything that deals with football up until sunday is a job and a business on sundays thats the one time you get to put all that aside and just play the game
7272838 i love the challenge of it the play calling part of it the strategy the whole deal
7272839 its just a different feeling when you put your heart into something that you love doing the only other feeling like that for me is when im in church and getting excited just the energy sometimes i get the chills i feel it before every game
7272840 its all different depending on the time of the game
7272841 for a 1 oclock game everything is happening real fast you have to get up real early and you dont really have time to think about anything you prepare yourself the night before you make sure youre hydrated i really dont like night games because it seems like it takes forever to come around a 1 oclock game you wake up bam bam bam lets do it
7272842 i cant sit here and lie to you and tell you i dont the way we play were an aggressive defense so we have to be on our game at all times some opponents i definitely get a little nervous about its not a lack of confidence or preparation but you always want to go out and do your best and when a lot of pressure is put on you youre the guy that everybody is counting on
7272843 my hands are literally trembling but it has been that way for years for some odd reason ive been able to make an extra point almost feel the same way as a last second field goal its good for the last second field goal i dont think its so good for the extra point
7272844 most of the work is done during the week you exhaust it and then you get to the point where you just go ok im there im done and its over i go back through the game plan one more time sunday morning then drop it for a couple of hours and go over and play
7272845 and were laughing we may be laughing with the receivers and youll see guys with their ipods
7272846 i dont get into all that if the game comes down to a pregame speech youre probably going to get killed after the first hit those guys dont remember any of that stuff you get all that done during the week thats when you start building the bully by the time you get to game day then you just cut it loose
7272847 ive never gone into a game where i just felt like we were in trouble
7272848 i never felt that way i think its because as an offensive lineman you are playing against a better athlete 99 percent of the time and you find a way of beating that guy you just find a way to do it whether its by preparation angles whatever thats kind of the same approach i take with coaching games
7272849 when i get over to the stadium i get into the hot tub get a good stretch and then go out on the field and run around and get acclimated to the weather
7272850 when the officials give their two minute call i head out dodge a couple cheerleaders and try to get a couple more kicks in
7272851 im always the last guy called when they introduce the offense
7272852 you have to understand that youre going to have highs and lows
7272853 when you have highs you dont want to get overly excited and when you have lows you dont want to pull yourself down in the dumps you always have to have confidence that one play can get you back in your rhythm again
7272854 i always feel like my job out there is to get everyone involved in making plays and you want them to feed off making those plays so they bring energy to the huddle
7272855 some guys are good when theyre out of their mind hugh douglas was better that way for me that doesnt work ive got to stay focused on the job at hand blowing up doesnt help yelling at players and screaming at coaches thats not my deal it doesnt work for me and i dont think it works for the guys around me
7272856 i take it to heart because i know how much work we put in and its not a good feeling i usually talk about it for a couple of days me and brian westbrook talk about what we could have done or what we should have done
7272857 the whole next week is so much better with a win
7272858 everyone is in a better mood winning makes the bad things go away its the best kind of medicine you can take
7272859 the sick part of the game is whether you win or lose you go back and you analyze everything
7272860 its a weird deal but you do feel a lot better after wins than you do after losses my wife would probably tell you that after a loss im right back at the novacare complex im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not good with it thats the only time i probably take stuff home
7272861 investors are going to focus on the housing numbers and the financial sector
7272862 financials will remain in play and the anxiety over fannie mae and freddie mac will remain in the market place
7272863 its still possible that the government will nationalize fannie and freddie
7272864 nationalization will have a negative impact on the stock market as it will put tax payers on hook
7272865 it feels kind of weird it feels like a charity case
7272866 if you go out there youll probably see some skin cells on the track
7272867 hes got a live arm he just needs to in my opinion command strike one hes got too many walks for his innings
7272868 once he gets command of his fastball then hes going to be something special
7272869 by any historic standard if barack obama wins this election by close to four points that would be a major democratic victory
7272870 are just looking at things in a very ahistorical way
7272871 its just so naive to think obama would be higher
7272872 it feels kind of weird it feels like a charity case
7272873 if you go out there youll probably see some skin cells on the track
7272874 recently untrue rumours have surfaced about my health and have caused anxiety among believers inside and outside iraq
7272875 a mothers imagination can do a real number on her nerves
7272876 finally i have lived to see an african american as the nominee of my party
7272877 democrats do not want to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory again
7272878 so when you go through a period like we are in right now there is a feeling that we have seen this movie before and it doesnt end well
7272879 work my heart out to make sure that senator obama is our next president
7272880 obama has to show that hes connected with small town america he has to show hes connected with the america of state fairs and high school proms and drive in restaurants hes got to show that type of connection not just chic urban and educated
7272881 to make voters comfortable with him being the next president and next commander in chief
7272882 youve got to do this in a way that really leaves a strong impression with voters
7272883 you want to avoid what john kerry did in 2004 which was a cotton candy convention that tasted great and was a lot of fun a lot happened but it really had no staying power
7272884 they didnt draw sharp contrasts between kerry and bush when voters see a candidate who doesnt fight back that tells them that he is not going to fight for them either when the going gets tough
7272885 the morphing of george bush and john mccain will be fully accomplished at the convention
7272886 when im in this uniform when im with people in uniform i could go tomorrow
7272887 but when im home in civilian life its harder i have every imaginable comfort
7272888 i have faith in my battle buddies and training to successfully make it back in a year
7272889 i love being a part of my family it hasnt hit me yet it probably wont until i get on the plane or step onto the sand for the first time i will miss everyone but it will be ok i have to make the best opportunity out of the situation there will be high points and low points but you can say that about anything in life
7272890 i look at it alarmed at times because of what can be happening
7272891 were in the same boat as a lot of other families i look at her and it makes me proud of her i cant even fathom what shes doing
7272892 you always say when your kids are in pain or something along those lines you want to trade places with them
7272893 i thought she was going back to school i felt anxiety fear regret sadness and concern
7272894 the thought of what could happen you read about it every day its reality you cant escape it but my little girl has grown up and will go out to protect our country
7272895 lets just hope she comes home alive whole both mentally and physically and not having been sexually abused harassed or raped by her fellow troopers
7272896 i want it to be organized so the kids will feel welcome when they walk through the door
7272897 if they dont feel welcome it could limit their success at the beginning of the year
7272898 it lets them know im not just a teacher i am a member of the community and i have hobbies and interests
7272899 and it lets them know i do go to the grocery store so if they see me they wont be surprised
7272900 the key to having a successful kindergarten class is to have structure and procedures in place
7272901 i look forward to getting to know my new students
7272902 the first days are always fun because they look scared of you
7272903 its been like this all my life nothing has changed im getting lost here
7272904 we hope to extract about 30 million ounces of silver over the next 10 years and we hope well find more down there
7272905 they call it a ghost town but there are no ghosts here
7272906 at times one feels very alone here everyone who lives here is a family but we need more people
7272907 the local residents were worried about traffic and noise and their water supply cyanide understandably they dont want their lifestyle changed they were looking for jobs
7272908 i think the chronology indicates other factors are reducing the flow in the creek
7272909 as you can imagine people who move to a place like shafter value their peace and quiet so in a perfect world id rather nothing change
7272910 i knew when i moved here that it was in a mining district so theres always been a sense we were on borrowed time that the mine would reopen
7272911 the problem with the mining company as friendly as it a very big dog for the neighborhood
7272912 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
7272913 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
7272914 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
7272915 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
7272916 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
7272917 they had words howell was ready with his gun and when speed tried to pull his howell shot him some thought he was defending himself
7272918 our nations tourism industry is still growing every year combined with thailands own economic growth i can not see the commercial market slowing for sometime
7272919 for everybody who is participating its a very important job
7272920 most of the time with scientific work you see an end product that is maybe a scientific paper but you dont see an end product like we see now hopefully a new line on the map
7272921 we want to have capabilities to deal with potential threats
7272922 but were certainly not going to arbitrate some sort of solution related to the extended continental shelf using patrol vessels to even set it up like were responding to the russians to me is missing the point the science has to come first
7272923 may constitute the geographically largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on earth
7272924 the need to demonstrate our sovereignty in the arctic has never been more important which is why our government has made this research a top priority
7272925 our commitment to this initiative as well as other investments in the north is ultimately about turning potential into prosperity for this remarkable region and for our country as a whole
7272926 and wherever there is a significant sediment accumulation there is a potential for oil or for gas
7272927 hopefully next year we go further north until we run out of sediments or until we reach the area of the submarine mountain chains
7272928 this is a very clear way of measuring and defining those outer limits certainly for a country like canada this is a unique opportunity to get that line defined and to get that outer limit internationally recognized
7272929 were the springboks were the world champs and weve lost two games in a row
7272930 if you go into the change room and look at the players they are definitely feeling worse than the crowd out there it is unacceptable for us to play like that
7272931 the chances are there but we are making too many mistakes
7272932 i have a new playing style that were trying to put in there
7272933 rome wasnt built in one day so there should be patience i would ask the public to give us some time just to get to grips with what we want to do
7272934 if we execute this playing style correctly with the speed and the power and great athletes we do have it is going to be enormous and people will find it hard to stop us

7272936 le quiero decir al secretario general de la oea nuestro amigo insulza le quiero decir con todo respeto el proceso electoral en nicaragua lo decidimos los nicarag enses
7272937 y si se nos tiene que llevar a retirarnos de ese instrumento del imperio de la oligarqu a nos retiramos antes que aceptar las imposiciones de la oea nicaragua seguir caminando con oea o sin oea

7272943 we have witnessed the spectacle of a presidents humiliation by his colleagues
7272944 the dark days will be worth all they cost if they teach us that political service is for the purpose of serving our fellow south africans
7272945 the unwritten economic and social compact that enjoys broad support across the political centre is coming under strain within the tripartite alliance
7272946 there are political illiterates among us who are trying to pretend the differences of policy and strategy between the anc and the ifp will be wiped out merely because the leader of the anc is a zulu
7272947 zuma has been a zulu all his life and he has always been a member of the anc he was an anc minister representing the interests of his party and this has nothing to do with being a zulu
7272948 co operation agreements with other parties should be made after the people have spoken at the ballot box and not before
7272949 for this is the will of my father that everyone who looks on the son and believes in him should have eternal life and i will raise him up on the last day
7272950 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7272951 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7272952 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7272953 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7272954 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7272955 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7272956 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7272957 he knew he was six points down and bit me he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout
7272958 i looked at the board and it said i was silver then it dropped me down to bronze
7272959 but i have to be happy i came out to these olympics with the hope of getting two medals one of them gold and that is what i have done it has been fantastic i feel very lucky to be here
7272960 i wasnt aware the prime minster was here although i got a good luck note from him just before i competed
7272961 that is pretty cool to know i was being watched by the prime minister
7272962 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7272963 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7272964 he knew he was six points down and bit me he was tough horrible and strong throughout the bout
7272965 i looked at the board and it said i was silver then it dropped me down to bronze
7272966 but i have to be happy i came out to these olympics with the hope of getting two medals one of them gold and that is what i have done it has been fantastic i feel very lucky to be here
7272967 i wasnt aware the prime minster was here although i got a good luck note from him just before i competed
7272968 that is pretty cool to know i was being watched by the prime minister
7272969 in no way did i get the indication that he might be ready to sell
7272970 i think the reason i was invited down was to make sure i could understand his feelings about things and where he saw the club going now
7272971 i now have a better awareness of where we are at and im comfortable with that i know the investment in the club will continue
7272972 theres a lot of stuff flying around that doesnt really involve football so i can understand the speculation but the reality is i was very encouraged by dr thaksins enthusiasm for the season ahead
7272973 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7272974 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7272975 we have already been in contact with horse racing ireland and we will discuss things ourselves and get back in touch with them tomorrow
7272976 what happened last week was a big loser for us and racing on saturday was far from pleasant in the conditions
7272977 but we dont want to go out with a whimper and well probably look for two or three days late in september or early in october and give it one more shot
7272978 we will certainly do our best to salvage what we can for tralee because of what has happened due to the very bad weather
7272979 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
7272980 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
7272981 its like treacle in january at the moment its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
7272982 well wait and see and if we can bring them in then all well and good but if not well go with what weve got now
7272983 i am going to have a chat with mr cecil and well make a plan during the week we will keep our options open a little while longer
7272984 despite a doubling of efforts in the sale of the 1 000 syndicate tickets sligo rovers have so far only managed to gather 44 000 of their targeted 130 000
7272985 the club is now appealing to all the people of sligo and beyond to come along to fill the showgrounds for our next two home games against drogheda united on august 30 and bohemians on september 5
7272986 we are also asking all those who normally pay the 15 entry fee season ticket holders committee members stewards press and anyone who comes to the next two home games to make a 20 voluntary contribution to the club

7272990 champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up its how quickly you get up
7272991 hes an old charlton player hes loved by the fans here and his experience and character will add to what weve got
7272992 the pressure is the same when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure the same
7272993 im very happy to be number one its a big satisfaction after a long time being number two but at the same time nothing changes
7272994 this is the last grand slam of the season so its going to be very important for everybody
7272995 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
7272996 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will become very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
7272997 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7272998 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7272999 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7273000 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7273001 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7273002 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7273003 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7273004 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7273005 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7273006 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7273007 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7273008 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7273009 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7273010 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7273011 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7273012 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7273013 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7273022 ich denke all die aufzeichnungen die nist zusammengestellt hat sollten archiviert werden ich w rde wirklich gerne sehen wie jemand anders eine blick auf das wirft was sie gemacht haben gleicherma en aus einem architektonischen blickwinkel und auf feuer bezogen ich denke die offizielle schlussfolgerung zu der nist gelangte ist fragw rdig

7273024 warum w rden alle 47 stockwerke des wtc 7 in rund 7 sekunden gerade nach unten fallen es war nicht von einem flugzeug getroffen worden oder von einem brand eingeh llt eine unabh ngige untersuchung ist bei allen drei einst rzen gerechtfertigt sowie bei den verbleibenden stahlproben und der zusammensetzung des staubs
7273025 wtc geb ude 7 h tte nicht einst rzen k nnen auf grund von internen br nden und externen tr mmern kein flugzeug hatte das geb ude getroffen dies ist der einzige fall auf der welt in dem ein stahlrahmengeb ude durch feuer einst rzt das feuer in diesem geb ude war klein und rtlich begrenzt was war also die ursache

7273028 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7273029 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7273036 we have spent 25million before kompanys arrival this summer on transfers and securing a new manager and are actively seeking further new signings
7273037 we have also given a new improved and much deserved contract to richard dunne add to that 70million invested last year and if that does not show commitment from an owner then nothing does
7273038 we have specialists in white collar crime criminal law juvenile delinquency and many other fields
7273039 im surrounded by an incredible group of people most of them are current police officers who are older and responsible and have a great deal to share with the students
7273040 dealers like rural areas because there are fewer people around and its easier for them to hide what they re doing
7273041 o que mesmo que mal corrido tivesse seria sempre um pastiche de coisas que ou n o fazem sentido ou que s o muito dificeis de compreender quanto mais de articular de modo concreto e sem a devida dose de sentido do rid culo area espec fica do desporto
7273042 destes jogos ol mpicos n o tivesse vindo de atletas que representam a maior na o atl tica do mundo n o vamos imaginar as hip rboles que sairiam do contra a corrente se aquilo tivesse acontecido com portugueses
7273043 resisti ideia de que eventuais melhorias de natureza gen rica
7273044 quando o mais pr ximo que tive dessa falsidade foi quando enumerei banalidades como a import ncia da altitude no declinio do meio fundo e fundo europeus onde constam paises com estruturas e m todos de treino a dar com um pau ou quando me insurgi contra a inolvid vel declara o de que os atletas portugueses revelariam uma

7273047 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god priest antonio rungi of the southern italian diocese of modragone told the daily corriere della sera
7273048 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm he said
7273049 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns notably from africa and latin america
7273050 i hope the next pageant wont just take place online but that we can organise a real show that can take place during the miss italy contest rungi said

7273062 okay glentoran put us under a bit of pressure but that was to be expected its a team pushing for league titles but when you go down to ten men its always going to be difficult
7273063 i would say the first half performance was very rusty and thats credit to lisburn distillery they probably controlled the first half then second half i said a few things at half time we came out and looked more positive were disappointed with the result probably more so with the performance in the first half
7273064 wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it thats like a kid who sees his toys before christmas it takes away from me and i think it takes away from the fans as well when its time imma give it to you they leaked my record with me and

7273086 my life was just a living hell after i was accused of this
7273087 imagine being blamed for setting fire to the home of someone who had lost three nephews in an arson attack
7273088 i couldnt believe it when the police came to my door and arrested me for a terrible crime
7273089 i have a clear record and would never ever dream of doing something like this
7273090 i couldnt even attend my uncles funeral with this thing hanging over me and im just so pleased my name has been cleared once and for all
7273091 this man was a friend of mine and i never ever thought i would be accused of doing something like this after we had a stupid falling out i couldnt even work with this stigma hanging over me but im getting back on my feet now and am just looking to the future
7273092 i would hate for any innocent man to experience what i went through the whole episode was awful and just a waste of resources for the legal system
7273093 anyone who knows me knew from the start that i was not capable of such an offence
7273094 i have a clear record and my conscience is also clear i cant thank the people enough who stood by me during these very difficult two years
7273095 i had nothing but sympathy for the quinn children and theres no way i would set out to do something like this to a family
7273096 as far as im concerned this matter is now resolved and i now just want to claim back the two years of my life which i lost when the police came to my door
7273097 carters appointment isnt until the end of october but in my heart i know we must go now
7273098 if we wait any longer his condition will only get worse and he might not be able to make the journey
7273099 carters life is at risk the longer we leave it and i believe this is our only chance
7273100 its agony for carter and heartbreaking to watch him go through all this
7273101 hes been so brave and there have been times when i thought i was going to lose my precious son
7273102 now im just hoping he will be well enough to make the flight on tuesday
7273103 people have been marvellous and when i last checked with the bank there was 16 000 in the account
7273104 when carter does get to see dr douglas nordli head of the chicago clinic he will have three tests carried out costing around 9 500 dollars there will be a video eeg over 24 hours an mri scan and a genetic consultation
7273105 then if carter is admitted and put on a new dietary regime it will cost us around 1 600 dollars a day
7273106 its so expensive but the level of treatment and expertise carter needs is just not available in northern ireland or even the mainland
7273107 on top of that ill have to find an apartment and naturally all the day to day living expenses
7273108 i know im on a wing and a prayer but ill go to the ends of the earth to see that carter gets this treatment
7273109 this is my son he didnt ask to be born with this condition but he has incredible strength of character
7273110 when we started out i though people would have far too much on their plate to bother with us
7273111 but we were desperate and the reward has been the incredible response from ordinary people on the street weve been amazed and peoples letters and emails have been so supportive
7273112 its carters journey of hope and were praying it will give him the opportunity of a real and rewarding life
7273113 were going to get there i know we will this whole thing is unravelling and we are working from the outside in to bring these people to justice
7273114 witnesses to crimes and victims of crimes committed by these people who may have been afraid to speak out in the past are now coming forward
7273115 for example we intend to talk to people who escaped from this gang after they tried to kill them we will be asking people who shot them
7273116 the crimes under investigation include sectarian murders feud killings punishment shootings and other serious crimes that these people were involved in
7273117 our investigations are focused on forensic applications and there are a good number of cases we can progress because of the advances in science and technology
7273118 i could have been in retirement now but i took an undertaking to bring these people to justice and i intent to fulfil it for the fam ilies who are paramount in our investigations
7273119 there are people who were on the fringes of this group and who may have helped planned serious crimes such as murder if these people dont come to us with information then we will go after them
7273120 but this investigation is about going after the major players who committed serious acts of crime over many years
7273121 witness protection schemes are in place and people should not be afraid to come forward because we will protect them
7273122 we are positive of the government legislation we intend to use to bring these people before the courts and we also intend to link various crimes committed by these people since 1991 our work is ongoing and we will continue to explore the full range of criminality committed by this group
7273123 although my sisters murder was before the good friday agreement i still believe that the people who killed her should be jailed
7273124 they may only do a short period of time for her murder but if they are in jail for other offences then they could end up being behind bars for a long time
7273125 i was told a couple weeks ago that there would be arrests and this wouldnt come as a surprise to me the victims families will be meeting again with the het to discuss the progress which has been made
7273126 we still deserve justice after all these years and we hope the het can help us achieve this aim
7273127 the killers of my son and other victims should realise that they wont get away with what they did over the years
7273128 he has been working with me for about six years and this arrest has hit me like a sledgehammer
7273129 he is obviously innocent until proven guilty and we will be taking an interest in the case
7273130 i wont be able to comment further until the case has been concluded
7273131 its hard to believe that a councillor has been charged with such a serious offence and we will have to wait and see what happens
7273132 im just glad that im able to being something home to everyone who has supported me and cheered me on throughout these olympics
7273133 its fantastic to be bringing home a medal but i always believed in my own ability i was disappointed with the judges scoring in the semi final i think the crowd played a big part
7273134 your initial aim is to qualify for the olympics but then once you are here you want to win a medal and thankfully i was able to do that
7273135 i hope therell be a few more when i get home
7273136 wayne and hugh both went on to have very good professional careers after the olympics but im still not sure what path ill be taking i might hang around for london 2012
7273137 were all just so proud of him hes come to the olympics and really done the business
7273138 qualifying for beijing was a big achievement so to have gone on and won a medal is something very special the whole experience has been phenomenal weve had so many messages of support from back home and were very grateful to everyone for getting behind paddy
7273139 hopefully now the sporting bodies can put a decent package in place to enable paddy to stay amateur and go for gold at london 2012 hes already had approaches to turn professional but i would love him to put his pro career at least on hold but the lad has to live and im just hoping that common sense prevails in terms of funding
7273140 he is a hard worker and has pace it was a big day for him hes a shankill road man who always wanted to play for the blues and to score the winning goal on his home debut was a big moment for him
7273141 while we passed the ball well and retained it we didnt create much
7273142 we deserved more than what we got our keeper really had only one save to make
7273143 but i was put out because of the trouble in the area and i ended up homeless
7273144 this was the perfect chance to rebuild our lives to start again and now were back to square one
7273145 it was absolutely disgusting my house stank the next day and the most unimaginable things could be seen just floating down the street during the flooding
7273146 we were worried about getting sick and before environmental health were called the firemen were advising us to wash with disinfectant afterwards
7273147 i know we have a house to stay in for the minute and a cheque for a thousand pounds but none of us had home insurance
7273148 and it doesnt begin to cover the cost of the daily essentials that have been destroyed
7273149 the temporary house has a washing machine and cooker but we do not even have a sofa in the living room to sit on
7273150 i didnt really know what was happening until the water was already coming into my house
7273151 i didnt know what to lift first so i grabbed my daughter and put her upstairs with the dog to see what i could save
7273152 but by the time i did that it was too late it got everything in my home i was too busy worrying about jenny to save anything
7273153 jenny doesnt understand why her toys arent there and why she has no dvds to watch before going to bed
7273154 its had a profound effect on her she cant comprehend the situation like other people all she knows is that we cant go back home and she doesnt have many of her favourite toys anymore
7273155 she had to be lifted from the house by the firemen and that was quite traumatising for her my mum walked behind in the water to try and make her feel at ease
7273156 i was just in shock all weekend i just couldnt think straight and then they told us that everything had to go that had been touched by the water
7273157 it was devastating they were telling me i had to dump all of our belongings but we had no idea of how we were going to replace even the most basic of things the 1 000 we will get wont cover it
7273158 it was like in slow motion we watched it build up on the road and then up the path we kept
7273159 i used tea towels every towel in the house house coats anything that would soak up the water
7273160 but we were fighting a losing battle i had heard it gurgling in the toilet downstairs and went to check on it
7273161 by the time i arrived in the kitchen it was already ankle deep
7273162 there is just me and my 15 year old son adam in the house but we had to gather people together to help the neighbours
7273163 the man on one side of me is in a wheelchair he only has one leg
7273164 the woman on the other side has a son who is severely mentally and physically disabled everyone was trying to help each other it was just panic stations
7273165 i went upstairs to get something and the children were playing in the living room
7273166 the next thing i heard all this splashing and couldnt work out where it was coming from
7273167 when i went downstairs there they were playing in the flooding coming into my home like it was normal i didnt know what to do the first floor of my house was covered in four feet of water and sewage
7273168 im here by myself all my family are in england
7273169 i was very lucky that people pulled together to help me
7273170 ive had to throw out everything that was in the bottom floor of my house food washing machine furniture everything that belongs to me
7273171 it will be months before i can get back in my house
7273172 i know the family may never forgive me for what happened but i honestly didnt mean for that fella to die
7273173 it was a stupid row over a girl it was a fight that got out of hand and something that i will have to live with for the rest of my life
7273174 i was trying to protect myself by picking up the knife i stabbed him in the arm i didnt mean for the knife to go through and strike his chest
7273175 im not looking for sympathy i just wanted to let the family know that i really am sorry for what happened that night if i could turn back the clock i would
7273176 im willing to meet them to show that im sincere and to show genuine remorse for what i did not a day goes by when i dont think about that night
7273177 ive undergone different classes in jail and when i get out the only thing i want to concentrate on is getting a job and getting on with my life
7273178 im not going to be anywhere near banbridge im going to be on probation for three and a half years and the last thing im going to do is jeopardise this
7273179 the anger management courses ive been on have really helped me and im no danger to anyone
7273180 ive paid for what ive done people shouldnt be afraid when im released back into society im no cold blooded killer i just want to be left alone when i leave prison
7273181 i went for parole but i didnt get it and i dont understand why i have kept my head down in prison and have stuck to the courses
7273182 i know ill have to wait until next february before im out i will have paid my debt to society by then and believe i deserve a second chance
7273183 why is this killer intent on causing more damage to our family with this pathetic insult its hard for me to respond to this thug
7273184 when he was jailed for my sons killing he was smirking and laughing at me in court his apology to me is nothing but an insult he never gave christopher a thought when he stabbed him and people should realise this
7273185 christopher was only in that house 10 minutes and look what happened to him hes already taken a member of my familys life theres no reason why he couldnt do it again when hes released
7273186 jail doesnt change people like him it still disturbs me greatly what happened to my son it has had a massive impact on me
7273187 magee is not a good person and i dont know why hes saying these things now the person he cares about is himself
7273188 the fact that hes saying hes participating in a number of programmes is irrelevent because the court ordered him to do this
7273189 he had a capacity for violence before he attacked christopher why is he doing all this now
7273190 this man took my sons life yet the system only charged him with manslaughter he should have been charged with murder and be spending life behind bars
7273191 there was blood all over me i still remember christopher lying on the ground and this image will never leave me his eyes were just glazed
7273192 i gave christopher first aid and magee was still behind he had pure hatred in his eyes and i thought he was going to attack me as i held christopher in my arms
7273193 magee just stood there and didnt care what he had done i know what i witnessed that night as far as im concerned he should have been on trial for murder
7273194 im very worried about this man being released because i think he could do this again
7273195 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7273196 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7273197 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7273198 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7273199 we urge the international community and especially members of the media not to divert their attention from china after the beijing olympics as the chinese authorities are likely to intensify their hostility towards tibetans post olympics
7273200 tibetans and supporters all over the world are deeply concerned about the thousands of tibetans who have been arrested and disappeared since march this year and we request governments around the world to pressurize china to release all political prisoners
7273201 we have been able to tell the world and the chinese government at the heart of china that tibet issue needs to be solved and until then tibetans and their supporters will continue their fight for truth justice and freedom
7273202 we have been able to use beijing olympics to highlight tibet issue by stealing its spotlight
7273203 we can build pressure on china through international bodies and governments to secure their timely or early release
7273204 i know china deliberately lies to the world i have survived under chinese lies myself
7273205 we all know and the world knows that dalai lama has always stood for peace truth and non violence but china has never stopped defaming our most revered leader and continues to accuse him of supporting separatist activities
7273206 tibetans and supporters around the world have been able to undermine chinas attempt to gain global acceptance
7273207 we will continue our fight against injustices towards tibetans inside tibet
7273208 its an absolutely gorgeous venue and all of the vendors that we were contracting with committed to contributing 10 of their fees to support the work of the center
7273209 do you think the name of the facility may have discouraged the republicans
7273210 its a nonprofit that is helping the community its a fabulous venue i thought the people hosting the events would focus on the support they were giving not who the center was named for
7273211 we had no idea a simple book launch or a book tour in the states was not possible
7273212 it means us readers will be denied the opportunity to meet mr mcintyre and learn first hand about the situation in northern ireland if gerry adams and ian paisley can travel to the us to discuss the progress being made in northern ireland as a result of the good friday agreement why cant mr mcintyre
7273213 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7273214 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7273215 yes it is very frustrating for me and the players and im sure the fans too
7273216 some of the players felt that it shouldnt have gone ahead but to be fair the referee wanted to give it every chance
7273217 but you could see from very early on that a couple of tackles were going in that werent malicious but because of the conditions it was very dangerous and someone could have got hurt
7273218 i can completely understand the decision and now we have to try and get focused on next weeks game
7273219 it is going to be very difficult to try and fit it in we are only a couple of weeks into the new season and already we are looking at fixture congestion
7273220 we have a county antrim shield game on tuesday night to deal with and then very soon the setanta cup games are coming up its a lot to deal with so early but i suppose everyone is in the same boat
7273221 it was a game that we were all looking forward to because it would give us a real look at how far we have come on and what we have to do
7273222 i thought we played well and i could see that the boys were really up for it and at least thats something i can take out of it
7273223 well just have to get on with it it wasnt ideal but the referee made the right decision to stop it because there was a lot of water lying on the pitch and if there is any danger that someone could get hurt then you have to call it off
7273224 i specialise in a business pool which includes belfast and scotland and im proud to describe myself as a loyalist and a unionist
7273225 a wide range of organisations come to us because we provide management training and marketing skills
7273226 when the bnp contacted us i had no option but to work with them it was an exciting business proposal
7273227 i understand the truth truck could soon be on its way to northern ireland but thats nothing to do with me
7273228 the bnp are not an illegal organisation so why shouldnt i work with them i dont think their members are involved in criminal activity
7273229 i have worked in northern ireland for a long time but not for any proscribed organisations the bnp is not a proscribed organisation
7273230 it would be wrong for me to pontificate about the views of the bnp and i honestly cant think of anyone i wouldnt work with
7273231 dowsons marketing plan is nothing more than a begging letter
7273232 the bnp is in very serious financial trouble and this is how they think they can get money
7273233 the bnp may not be illegal but they articulate views which clearly motivate people to commit very serious attacks on minorities
7273234 there is an element of inciting hatred there is no attraction in northern ireland for this type of politics and i would discourage this party from coming over here we have always had good race relations in northern ireland there may be the odd incident but that does not represent the majority of people here
7273235 it is lucky that many of the devices they have been using have failed to explode for various reasons the real danger is they only have to succeed once
7273236 until recently they had been largely only targeting commercial centres and police stations in fermanagh with large devices but have switched tactics to attempt to murder police officers
7273237 however we are well aware of who is behind this and there is a hardcore of around a dozen members
7273238 we have done everything by the book and andrew was at the game and the chairman jim kerr and i will sit down with him and his agent
7273239 we have been after andrew for a long time and my assistant bryan mclaughlin has done a lot of hard work to get us to this situation
7273240 after hamilton told us they wanted to keep the player after we made an offer some time ago we were approached by the hamilton but i know other clubs are interested and im sure his agent will be looking to get him the best deal possible
7273241 but the reality of the situation is that we have been pursuing andrew we would very much like him here and we have told him that
7273242 we want him here as much as we wanted kevin kelbie here but ultimately it will be up to him
7273243 but even if we do sign andrew our search continues
7273244 we need one more forward player if not two and we will keep looking
7273245 last week has gone now and i took the decision because i didnt see there being a dangers to the players and the ball was rolling
7273246 but as the game went on i was in constant contact with my assistants and after half an hour it was becoming a farce and there was a danger to the players so i stopped it immediately
7273247 it didnt matter that linfield were 1 0 up at the time as far as i was concerned the game would have been a farce and the players safety was the most important thing
7273248 im so proud of the way they performed against bath and the great thing from an ulster perspective is that so many of them could still be here in 10 years time
7273249 the number of guys playing who are under 22 is extraordinary i can never recall putting out a team as young as that
7273250 we had no fewer than 11 players wearing ulster jerseys for the first time
7273251 they also displayed huge character in coming back strongly after conceding two tries just before half time and that has to be a good omen for the season that lies ahead
7273252 its vital that these young players can now put their hands up for selection and put pressure on those international players who were sitting in the stand on friday night
7273253 there was a lot more counter attacking in this game than you would have had under the old laws
7273254 the introduction of an offside line five metres behind the scrum is a huge plus in that it offers far greater attacking opportunities
7273255 but ive still no idea why weve given the defensive line out such a massive advantage effectively its going to kill the line out
7273256 in future there will be no need for big towering second rows that have been an integral part of the game for so long
7273257 its a great pity for the dundrod club who had put so much effort into the meeting however from early morning it had been expected that the meeting would be called off
7273258 there had been weather forecasts giving us a bit of hope but as the day went on it was obvious that we were whistling in the dark
7273259 under the current regulations we are unable to hold the meeting on sunday and so the ulster grand prix has been lost
7273260 its as bad as i have seen it i remember that day 20 odd years ago when joey dunlop and myself did two sighting laps but after that the stewards decided to race
7273261 we then had a warm up lap and joey said to me this race shouldnt go ahead lets see it we can stop it we made approaches but to no avail and as you know there was a death on the third lap
7273262 i still remember that day for i had taken an early lead to avoid the rest of the field its a great pity that today has happened but theres nothing one can do about it
7273263 i would have raced had the conditions relented but there was no way that was possible its a great pity for the promoters and the crowd many of them were still in the stands hoping for racing to start
7273264 it is all very sad but to be honest i wouldnt have raced in those conditions
7273265 i was prepared to race but obviously the visibility would have made this dodgy im shattered that the meeting has been abandoned for i was really looking forward to it
7273266 i would have raced but the conditions deteriorated so much that it was really impossible to start
7273267 we held off as long as possible but at the end of the day the weather beat us we tried every avenue and postponement possible and only made our decision to abandon at the last minute
7273268 this weather has been as bad as i have seen it in seven years as clerk of the course but lets get things in perspective during that time weve had two deaths and its more important that we dont race when conditions are impossible
7273269 we have suffered a heavy financial blow but hopefully our meetings with the government in the immediate future will help us regain some of our outlay we are beginning negotiations on monday
7273270 at the time of the abandonment it certainly wasnt raceable i would have gone on alright but it was obviously impossible to ride in such appalling weather its a real shame for all concerned
7273271 we fully support the ulster grand prixs decision to abandon the planned race programme due to the horrendous weather conditions
7273272 the safety of riders and spectators is paramount and the clerk of course cannot take any unnecessary risks we understand it is terribly disappointing for fans and competitors alike but we believe it was the best decision under difficult circumstances
7273273 the council are disappointed that the ulster grand prix had to be cancelled
7273274 the council commiserates with the dundrod club and will work with the club to see that the race is back at dundrod next year
7273275 i thought we were clinical in the first half and extremely professional when glenavon tried to come at us in the second half
7273276 we made them play from side to side and when they put the ball in the air to try and get at us we dealt superbly with it
7273277 i think the fact that crusaders had played two competitive games before us showed in the first 20 minutes
7273278 its disappointing because we talked about certain things that crusaders would do especially their corner kicks and we didnt do what we had talked about doing
7273279 i can take positives from this especially our second half performance but its a kick up the backside for us
7273280 we have received a request from their advisor for a definitive agreement to sell their holdings at around 1 350 pence with a condition that it be re negotiated if the counter bid is 10 per cent above this price
7273281 ovl will make a formal bid early next week it is a negotiated deal in which the management has extended full support
7273282 my wifes scottish and all her family are big scotland fans
7273283 its going to be interesting to see where her loyalties lie on wednesday night
7273284 but ive told her she hasnt got a hope of getting a ticket off me unless she wants to sit in the northern ireland end and cheer us on
7273285 ill be playing for northern ireland and i want us to win scotland are simply another team that must be beaten in my eyes
7273286 yes i may have lived and worked in scotland for some time now but that doesnt mean i want anything less than a good performance and a northern ireland win at hampden
7273287 if that causes a few arguments then so be it
7273288 i want to win this match as much as any other
7273289 i dont buy into the idea that this is just a friendly and therefore doesnt really matter
7273290 it matters to me and im sure it matters to nigel worthington and every member of this squad
7273291 i think its important to set the right tone ahead of the qualifiers and it would be wonderful for team morale
7273292 slovakia next month is very important but i dont view this game any differently
7273293 ive played at hampden park on a few occcasions although they havent been overly memorable for me that would at least change if we managed to get a result on wednesday
7273294 i hate visiting toronto i cant stand it the place drives me mad i have friends there i work there but i find it really hard to like i will have to go back there but i wish i didnt have to
7273295 no you are only entitled to an upgrade after 12 months and every 12 months after

7273297 well if you cant get the bold you can get the iphone 3g at the upgrade price
7273298 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7273299 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marvelled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7273300 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th xxx olympiad
7273301 they said we dont have time to deal with your acquaintances
7273302 despite legal issues some i 93 projects going forward in nh
7273303 that might be funny ill come back to it later and see if i still think so

7273305 is that sex segregation does not reflect sex differences between men and women rather it constructs them
7273306 women are told around that time that they are athletically inferior to men and that they should start acting like ladies thats why we see the boys making such stunning gains at that age and the girls begin to suffer
7273307 the boys 13s we can handle pretty consistently but when the boys start really developing at 14 and especially 15 thats when you start to see real separation and they pass even the best womens players theyre just bigger stronger and faster
7273308 why on earth are pool and ping pong sex segregated
7273309 you would not believe the amount of men in my world who can wax me
7273310 theres a whole establishment thats invested in perpetuating the notion that there are not inborn differences between the genders athletically and that any differences can only be attributable to sociological circumstances and societal oppression they have a clear agenda to empower women through a distorted notion of equality but these people are saying things that are completely out of touch with biological reality
7273311 ive been at faculty meetings where the notion that there are differences in the genders is ridiculed
7273312 t he first woman dean at harvard was my dean when she got here and when i would try to bring up studies that showed inborn gender differences she wouldnt even allow it
7273313 when you have a large group of people with a vested interest in maintaining an agenda
7273314 theyre going to find ways to attack anyone or anything that threatens their existence
7273315 at most newspapers title ix is gospel at this point and anything that could be seen as an argument against it is going to be ignored attacked or ridiculed
7273316 i have a colleague here in town that has a biologically based view of gender differences shes done a whole lot of research that shows fairly large important differences between boys and girls in their socio relationships at an early age and she was prevented from publishing that at several points from people who just didnt want to hear that point of view regardless of the evidence
7273317 an experiment that would challenge teachers and administrators to ensure the hand held devices are used as learning tools not toys
7273318 our teachers state their commitment to teach 21st century skills because technology is the future for students and teachers
7273319 its still not clear how the ipod touches would be used at culbreth middle school and school officials know that students may use the ipod touches more to download the new jonas brothers single than to tap the riches of human knowledge
7273320 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7273321 the emphasis can shift to project based learning a real break with the textbook and lecture model of education in a high school class a project might begin with a hypothetical letter from the white house that says oil prices are spiking the economy is faltering and the presidents poll numbers are falling the assignment would be to devise a new energy policy in two weeks
7273322 oh dang i completely forgot about that little 4 000 sqauare footer on the beach down in the florida keys i just havent been there in 8 years
7273323 i wanted to give myself time to heal so that when i got out there again id be ready to give whoever i am with the respect and attention she deserves
7273324 i am ready i am open to giving these girls everything i can to find the one that is right for me all i am missing really is someone to share my life with theres no guarantee but 25 girls its a real opportunity to find just one
7273325 all i could think was oh man i am so excited mostly because really i am just the most regular guy you could ever come across and for this to be happening to me is unbelievable
7273326 the project began in 2004 when writer and project lead haden blackman was tasked with creating a new star wars game that would harness the power of next generation consoles and feature an original concept that would satisfy both gamers and george lucas himself
7273327 we showed george this video and his reaction was go make that game
7273328 for us that was a really exciting moment although i was terrified because at that point we didnt have any of the tools or technology to actually build it which is what we spent the next few years doing
7273329 a game lives or dies based on solid gameplay but its the graphics and sound that take it from good to great and theres no doubt that the force unleashed is going to end up in the great column playing on the xbox 360 the graphics are gorgeous the game has a dark feel to it combined with the cinematic of the star wars universe the sound is also dead on from the whirl of the lightsaber to the buzz of a tie fighter zipping past
7273330 after learning the controls we entered a huge hangar full of tie fighters for kicks we lifted a piece of equipment and chucked it at one of the ships causing it to explode we also snagged a power up that increased our damage from there we surveyed the area and saw that a small battle had broken out between stormtroopers and rebels a great opportunity to insert vaders apprentice into the mix we jumped double jump by pressing a twice x for ps3 into the action and immediately started killing slicing through rebels throwing them across the hangar and stabbing them while they were down at first it seemed like the stormtroopers didnt know what to make of him but they quickly learned that although the apprentice was carrying a red lightsaber he wasnt on their side
7273331 hands on with star wars the force unleashed on ds and psp
7273332 it sounds like a recipe for yet another repetitive star wars romp but as soon as you realize that star wars the force unleashed is as much about making skilful use of your considerable repertoire of moves as it is about the simple mechanics of clearing enemies and then moving onto the next bunch the games true conceit becomes apparent

7273353 the british team is ready and thats important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population that has been achieved four years beforehand and they will be able to improve even on that
7273354 i believe and i hope that london can put the bar even higher so that we have consistent improvement and evolution of the olympic games
7273355 i believe london has unique assets athens was returning to the roots to the country that invented the olympic games china was the most populous country in the world
7273356 london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play
7273357 i heard some things that there were three or four gun shot wounds and that it was about an hour and a half until he was found
7273358 he the victim usually doesnt get mixed up in these kind of things
7273359 we are investigating further and that investigation is being led by our team in north america they are in control of the systems

7273361 we are currently in the process of working with our credit card partners to ensure that all relevant procedural standards are met and that the interests of our guests are protected
7273362 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7273363 the victim believed to be aged 18 years was taken by london ambulance to whipps cross hospital he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival
7273364 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7273365 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run away from the scene
7273366 we want a game with 11 versus 11 but when you lose that player its always going to be tough
7273367 after the first challenge the referee could have spoken to the kid
7273368 by the letter of the law you could probably say they are yellow cards but if theres going to be challenges like that were going to book every single player
7273369 when we went down to 10 men we worked so hard but when we conceded the goal just before half time it was a really tough job to get that belief back in them
7273370 it was a fantastic ball from franco miranda and billy mehmet gets a clean header and probably doesnt realise where his bearings are
7273371 how are we supposed to know which figures have undergone which changes
7273372 hes trying to take two immediate actions on his turn and im telling him he cant do that
7273373 well the oracle clearly has reworded the card text and this immediate action is now a free action

7273382 an idle mind is a devils workshop so people they say i have my flight at 2 30 in the morning and i have 3 more hours 3 more hours and i dont have anything to do n too scared to sleep so this idle mind decided to write frankly i dont understand why i am feeling so low on leaving india i dont want to sound being unpatriotic jus i wanted to understand what is a nation or a country i mean what is india or what is usa a political entity bounded by clearly demarcated geographical boundaries and added to it a good deal of socio economic military historical and religious factors add all this together and we get it the birth of a nation not that i am a cynic i and jus trying to examine something in detail something that i have taken for granted always theoritically then me leaving one geographical confinement for another should not make me feel down but in actual the fact that maybe i wont be able to come back here for some years was upsetting i was like a doctor who has broken his leg he knows what is causing the pain but this knowledge does not reduce the pain or was my definition of a nation wrong this geographical and cultural concept also raises some serious question to what extent are we moulded by our surroundings am i an indian because i was born in this country suppose i was born in us or say i was a paki would i have been different would i have still liked the same tastes the same colours ar the same type of music would i have liked rock and blues if i was born in us i dont know the answer one more flaw that i am observing in the geographical model is that the nation then becomes a function of time patriotism limited by the view of nation in such model then becomes extremely fuzzy suppose we take the case of a soldier from tamil nadu who died for undivided india who died protecting sindh so is he a patriot think about it he was a fellow born in india who died protecting pakistan in todays scene he will be called a traitor a spy etc etc etc but we know he is an indian patriot the fallacy in the argument is obvious then we have to accept that geography model needs serious correction so what is a nation a concept a philosophy a way of life a nation is a concept no doubt but there is much more to it it is not a philosophy like marxism i think nation is a way of life the way ones goes about his or her day to day life makes sense actually does not much to me but thats the only option left my method of elimination but i makes sense i am missing india because i will be leaving a lifestyle with which i was very familiar i was venturing into a world whose lifestyle was not the sane as mine however though it made sense it seemed very simplistic if it was a way of life why did i feel happy when india won t 20 cup why i feel elated when tata buys corus do people can die or take life for a way of life well i dont know

7273402 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have
7273403 the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7273404 he was lovely funny and gentle i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7273405 he was caring and laid back and he had a very close family he was a family boy the people who have done this can run but they cant hide and hopefully justice will be done
7273406 i just had the call early this morning to say what happened and were going to pay our respects to the family
7273407 if they see more officers about then maybe it will deter the gangs from coming into this area
7273408 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7273409 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7273410 i have hoped for a return for a while and yesterday i began to believe that this deal could end well
7273411 last october when jose mourinho left i was 90 per cent certain i was going to leave
7273412 but then by the end of the season i wanted to stay because i didnt want to leave on a blank season
7273413 after a season like that i think it would have been too hard to move i wanted to put things right
7273414 i have a year left but i have been delighted with the backing i have received in the transfer market
7273415 im also delighted with who i have brought into my backroom staff
7273416 in no way did i get the indication that he might be ready to sell far from it in fact
7273417 i think the reason i was invited down was to make sure i could understand his feelings about things and where he saw the club going now
7273418 i now have a better awareness of where we are at and im comfortable with that i know the investment in the club will continue
7273419 theres a lot of stuff flying around that doesnt really involve football so i can understand the speculation
7273420 but the reality is i was very encouraged by dr thaksins enthusiasm for the season ahead
7273421 i thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style
7273422 i can understand that perhaps we got tired because there was a lot of pressure but we have to be realistic and say it is the consistency to play well for 90 minutes that we need
7273423 it is dangerous to invite teams especially teams of this quality on to you but thats what we did in the end the ball was in and around our penalty area far too much
7273424 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7273425 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to
7273426 ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7273427 its a great feeling to score 100 goals in english football
7273428 i have to thank the players too its not just me i couldnt score without them

7273434 as for spiritual cunning it was in the conceits of metaphysical poetry in the self conscious ambiguities of poetical language there are we are told as many types of it as deadly sins and in the paradoxes of pascals religious thought for ambiguity and paradox are the manner of speaking when reality and symbol mans mind and his soul are at cross purposes

7273442 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible
7273443 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all after i did my last dive and i saw i was in first i thought thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7273444 i knew it was a far chance but i did absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it its actually happened and i never thought it would
7273445 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
7273446 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
7273447 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
7273448 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
7273449 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7273450 she has been absolutely savaged by the talk shows rush limbaugh and sean hannity pull her apart almost every day
7273451 she knows who she is and where she comes from
7273452 it first lady is one of the ultimate symbols of grace femininity and american womanhood it will take some americans a moment to have that symbolized by a black woman
7273453 on top of that with michelle obama theres the stereotype about the angry black woman some of her mannerisms will be looked at through a different magnifying glass because she is black
7273454 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible
7273455 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all after i did my last dive and i saw i was in first i thought thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7273456 i knew it was a far chance but i did absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it its actually happened and i never thought it would
7273457 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7273458 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7273459 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7273460 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7273461 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7273462 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7273463 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7273464 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7273465 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7273466 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7273467 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7273468 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7273469 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7273470 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7273471 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7273472 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7273473 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7273474 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7273475 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7273476 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7273477 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7273478 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7273479 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7273480 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7273481 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7273482 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7273483 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7273484 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7273485 if obama loses racism is the only reason mccain might beat him
7273486 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7273487 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7273488 its west of us and the forecast is for it to kind of go stationary
7273489 youre not out of the heavy rain yet and youre probably going to see that today and tomorrow

7273495 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7273496 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7273497 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7273498 it just depends on the storm and where it dropped
7273499 the rain off from the north could flood the rivers
7273500 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7273501 ladies and gentlemen i asked to speak to you i dont normally look for an opportunity to speak in public but i wanted to look into the faces of these bosses to see if they are as cold hearted as my boss used to be before i went to west point i was in the ice business at the belle springs creamery in abilene kan i was second engineer from 6 p m until 6 a m in the morning seven days a week 52 weeks a year i was a union of one to ask the boss what i thought was my due and i got it and had the best job of town pullling ice welcome to the capitol and i feel a kinship to you thank you
7273502 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7273503 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7273504 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7273505 we excavated here a year ago and found the water supply to the roman fort which nobody knew anything about
7273506 we discovered evidence that this roman fort continued to operate for something like 200 years later than anybody suspected before
7273507 weve come back to try to find buildings because we think that while it may not have continued as a military fort it was still a place for civilians maybe the equivalent of a motorway service station
7273508 the road over the pennines needed services for the travellers somewhere for them to stop stables for their horses to feed and be watered said mr clay
7273509 so far this year it looks as though we might have found evidence of a bread oven a large amount of pottery such as vessels for cooking and eating
7273510 it seems to have been a real centre of activity
7273511 hopefully this weekend we will be successful in unearthing more evidence of roman civilisation here
7273512 for almost twenty one years from a d 117 to 138 publius aelius hadrianus ruled one of the mightiest empires the world has ever seen
7273513 at the heart of the empire was rome the largest city of the ancient mediterranean if not the globe a pulsating capital of one million inhabitants
7273514 the empire needed to gain strength and cohesion in order to be able to face the many threats to its prosperity and peaceful existence my italics hadrians achievements in these areas were outstanding his legacy immense
7273515 as for the numbers who perished from starvation disease or fire that was impossible to establish
7273516 dont ruin the event wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it
7273517 thats like a kid who sees his toys before christmas it takes away from me and from the fans as well when its time imma give it to you leakage is never a problem i have had im not used to it
7273518 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
7273519 we have sort of become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in
7273520 its scary because at this point you expect to be well set
7273521 theres also growing concern just about paying for everyday items like food and energy and peoples 401 k s are not what they were two years ago so they want to keep working and putting money into them
7273522 my family on my fathers side lived into their 100s so im preparing for 100
7273523 but im on four medications now which i will be for the rest of my life so health care is a big economic factor for me
7273524 like a lot of people we have a lot of our assets tied up in a house that is bigger than we need but were unable to sell
7273525 that means caring for mom and dad may hurt the childrens finances
7273526 i was always going to have as much fun as i could but i never thought that we would be a burden to them
7273527 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7273528 i have not selected him as i do not think that he was focused enough and i did not feel that he would be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7273529 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7273530 nihao pushpa we heard on twitter that you are coming to china they say you love the forests and are a really wild kinky one is it true that you have a stalin and a mao tattoo on your buttocks uuh why dont we meet in our lovely tree and explore some ripe fruits oh pushy pushy we are sooo horny

7273537 we have been ready to go for over an hour commander
7273538 im sure you were but as you know the sun only rose ten minutes ago on the planet there wouldve been no point in you or anyone else going down before it was light
7273539 yes and i want you to take data with you
7273540 i dont get it sir where is everything and how the hell did the slab get back there we had it suspended a metre above the ground to look at it now youd never guess it had been moved at all
7273541 therere no footprints andy look around every trace of our ever being here has been erased
7273542 as soon as were clear of the interference put me through to the
7273543 michaels you and farrugia follow the river upstream i want you to pay close attention to your instruments please any trace evidence may be very small
7273544 brax i want you and mainwaring to go downstream its only about eight kilometres to the waterfall at the coast same deal watch your instruments carefully
7273545 you people stay here i want this camp swept clean with every scanner we have we have blood spots here and a urine sample i want to know if theres anything else including a comprehensive scan of those sand circles myself mr data and lieutenant mrak will investigate the blood evidence here
7273546 right we start here my guess is they were moving towards the river
7273547 they went over the edge doctor the evidence is incontrovertible
7273548 i know that data what im trying to find out is how badly the captain was injured
7273549 can you ascertain what kind of blood it is is it arterial for instance or venous
7273550 so far all i can tell is that the blood belongs to captain picard and that its oxygen depleted indicating it was venous in nature but this droplet here
7273551 is oxygen rich and that tells me he has more than one injury dammit data we have to find them if they went over this cliff together the river wouldve carried them quite a way provided they didnt get out relatively quickly we need
7273552 make your way down to the river and scan the banks data ill join you shortly
7273553 beverly i want you and your crews back aboard the enterprise immediately
7273554 our crew at the ruins have been attacked by aliens it was sudden and unprovoked i want you and your crew back up here now and i dont have time to discuss it thats an order doctor
7273555 hobbs gather everybody together and prepare for a quick departure were leaving right now
7273556 data return to the shuttles immediately we have to leave right now
7273557 thats all right son im sure you tried your best
7273558 for now you rest then later maybe you can climb back to the cave and see if therere any wood pieces still alight from the fire if there are perhaps we can use them to light this one
7273559 tobias we are going to have to have a little chat about your use of inappropriate language a boy your age shouldnt know let alone use so many questionable words
7273560 maman used to say that your use of bad language should be in direct proportion to the severity of the situation considering our trouble i thought it was appropriate
7273561 while i cant condone your use of profanity i do remember your mothers very colourful outbursts when something went wrong in fact she could swear in more languages than i very impressive to witness but totally inappropriate in someone of your tender years how about we reach an agreement you strive to resist the urge to swear and ill try to forgive the lapses when they occur deal
7273562 okay but if you think being stuck on this planet with hardly any food or water and hurt doesnt warrant a few swear words i think youre off your rocker but all right deal
7273563 have you found a source of water yet have you had a drink
7273564 right as soon as you feel strong enough i want you to search for a water source i suggest you look at the base of the bluff the walls might have channelled the rain into pools at the bottom
7273565 we have two officers in sick bay both wounded with crossbow bolts
7273566 lieutenant farrel stevin was pretty bad but lieutenant andrew mcaveny less so selar reports theyre still both in surgery but the prognosis is good
7273567 will said the attack was unprovoked was there any warning

7273720 with this team were going to have to make that determination as if were cutting our team like an nfl squad were going to keep these guys and were going to play them this year then lets go ahead and play them i dont feel like we have enough depth on our team if we play these guys they might make some mistakes early but in the long run i think it will make us a better team

7273785 weve done these package tours with fellow 80s era band chicago

7273794 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
7273795 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written

7273805 its a lot more playful the kids have an amazing time and they love the fact that its a little more strategic because there are different ways that they can win

7273846 i think we did a hell of a job of putting american basketball back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7273847 they bought into a vision and it started to snowball
7273848 you never heard a player or coach blame someone else

7273850 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7273851 we are witnessing an overblown crisis of confidence and the effects of a global credit squeeze rather than a debt constrained slowdown
7273852 national income growth remains strong underpinned by the profits of the mining boom
7273853 the external sector is also poised for a recovery underpinned by sustained high demand for commodities and a significant depreciation in the australian dollar over 2009 and 2010 which will boost competitiveness
7273854 as renewed residential construction activity drives momentum in the economy and gross domestic product growth strengthens again the unemployment rate will drop back to current levels of close to 4 per cent by 2012

7273861 clear skies ahead boise leaders predict healthy valley outlook in 2008
7273862 we have had an almost unparalleled two decade run of just blistering economic growth and weve grown very accustomed to it
7273863 now were going through an episode of cyclical correction that happens from time to time
7273864 how could we have been so stupid in all honesty we should have all realized what was happening sooner
7273865 but none of us know how to predict the turning points
7273866 we are not immune to whats going on on the national front
7273867 knock both pillars out at the same time and its a pretty difficult situation
7273868 we slowed down enough that it snapped back and you have the same multiplier effect on the downside as you do on the upside
7273869 that 650 million just disappeared its gone to oil producing companies and big oil companies

7273876 thats something that normally occurs in every economy and sometimes a little downturn may be good the growth weve experienced in the last several years has caused problems too it may be good to slow a little bit so we can catch our breath
7273877 i cant justify doing that at the expense of our citizens when they have little or no capacity to provide more support for government
7273878 you tend to your knitting you invest in education you have as fair a tax structure as possible and you get creative with partnerships

7273884 its just weird i mean something happened to make this guy veer left off the runway
7273885 being among the hard working chinese people seeing the volunteers show up at the arena every day with big smiles on their faces that just made us want to go out and play even harder
7273886 it was the moment ive been dreaming about for four years now i already had bronze around my neck and i wanted gold to finally get it it feels great we hadnt won in eight years and had been doubted we showed its not about the names on the backs of our shirts but the three letters on the front
7273887 its more important and more special than any championship any of us will ever win
7273888 winning an nba championship cant compare to winning a gold medal for your country
7273889 everyone wants to talk about nba players being selfish arrogant and individuals what you saw was a team facing adversity bonding together and coming out with a big win
7273890 i was just trying to do what ive been doing all tournament
7273891 taking every opportunity im given and doing what they want me to do on both ends of floor tonight i was in the passing lanes shooting 3s trying to step up for my team thats what they put me on this roster for ive been doubted so much once again i was before this people saying shouldnt be on team i think i proved myself
7273892 they took this tournament very seriously these guys were hungry and wanted to get back to the top they showed they should be no 1 but they had to work for it

7273901 puerto rico for us has been a major success story since we arrived here more than seven years ago but the major concern for us is to have a reliable power supply
7273902 in order to keep our operations running without interruptions we were forced to make a major investment in assembling in location our own power plant
7273903 at hp we consider that all that financial resources could had been routed in expanding further our operations in the island instead of investing in a costly in house power plant
7273904 what for anybody else could only be an annoying flickering of the lights while they are reading of watching tv for us means that we have to go back and calibrate most of our components
7273905 once i lost several of my clients accounting files because of the frequents blackouts here in the trujillo alto
7273906 maybe we have problems but if we compare ourselves with other south american countries and even some areas in the united states we are way high above their standards of power supplementation we cover 98 of all households in the country thats like saying that almost every body in the island has power supply
7273907 overcoming the challenges of a difficult period for the global economy the puerto rico power authority managed after all to consolidate its reputation as a world class energy supplier
7273908 we have being able to reduce the amount of blackouts to a considerable 80 1 per year
7273909 one of the problems facing puerto rico s power supply was the economic plans drawn during the fifties that betted all a major expansion in the southern coast of the island but it never occurred
7273910 now our most important generators are in this location forcing us to transmit it to the consumers through a complicated network of lines with a consequent waste of energy
7273911 in order to have some level of control upon the open market price instability and political recurrences in traditional suppliers such as venezuela we signed purchase agreements with the brazilian oil company petrobras am rica inc which saved us some 9 million purchasing 10 million barrels of residual fuel oil
7273912 this agreement assured us a continuous and unaltered supply of fuel oil guaranteed under a preferential client clause that allowed us to stabilize the electricity prices our clients pay
7273913 out of every dollar we are able to save through the sound management of cost and operations we separate a portion that is accredited to this fund with more than 10 millions at present time
7273914 our fuel source has many advantages if we compare it with oil because is a lot cheaper and more environmentally friendly
7273915 we have proven reserves that will last for another 250 years which allows us to exercise a tight control on its price levels while oil is vulnerable to demand price manipulation by brokers and political situations around the world
7273916 therefore two years later in march of 1995 prepa and ecol ctrica signed a contract to purchase power of approximately 507 megawatts
7273917 much of the contamination we see today around the world is because oil contains high levels of sulfur that is corrosive to the environment while methane dissipates into the atmosphere with no major impact
7273918 our objective is to be a key player in the economic development of puerto rico by harmonizing the rational growth of our electrical system with the protection of the environment and always guaranteeing the proper handling of this public corporations funds
7273919 we built in carolina the first waste management recycling plant producing methanol that provides energy for a desalinization plant which provides drinkable water to the east coast of the island
7273920 we dont have to invest so much in developing new infrastructure just by encouraging our citizens to be more energy efficient is enough to reduce considerably our dependency on costly energy sources
7273921 instead of everybody being released at the same time from their jobs we can have different intervals for the workers to arrive and leave their working sites
7273922 every time somebody proposes an alternative there is another one defending some specific interests either private or political that kills that proposition even before is born
7273923 the ecb board support the decision of the icc to postpone the champions trophy until october 2009
7273924 the ecb board made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7273925 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at yesterdays teleconference
7273926 the ecb board recognise the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy tournament and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7273927 there was a unanimity to postpone the event until october next year appeasement wasnt part of the meeting at all
7273928 the pakistan cricket board have been extremely reasonable about the whole subject and they worked jolly hard to try to give comfort to the member boards of the teams touring that the place would be safe and secure
7273929 unfortunately five of the participating nations found it impossible to send their teams to pakistan because of safety and security concerns
7273930 voting was totally in favour of the postponement until october of next year
7273931 india were quite influential in persuading some other nations that was the right course of action
7273932 had we decided a month ago im sure the tournament would be taking place in sri lanka
7273933 but the amount of time its taken for the participating nations to come to their decision not to attend has reduced the time between today and start of tournament
7273934 it was just impossible to relocate and stage a world class tournament
7273935 were going to meet in the middle of september in dubai to consider the consequences of todays decision
7273936 every one of our members wish to ensure the icc champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7273937 were trying all routes there might be some buys and there might be some loans but i said that six weeks ago and nothing has so far happened
7273938 it is the last days of the sales and there is not much left
7273939 i hope to try and get maybe a couple of players in but for the quality i need us to get to continue forward i dont know if you can get someone with a few days to go
7273940 i need to add mainly midfield and forward players to the squad our defenders today were the reason we got a result
7273941 i feel as if ive let the players down ive got a real good relationship with the players and they know how i work
7273942 i got people like tim cahill mikel arteta joleon lescott phil jagielka leon osman tony hibbert phil neville all to build and have a group together on the understanding im going to progress everton and make them better
7273943 at the moment at this summer im not progressing everton so i feel as if im letting them down
7273944 my ambition is to develop everton every year ive been here i feel i developed this is the first summer where i dont feel ive made any progress
7273945 my ambition is that i want to challenge the top managers in the league
7273946 weve not had massive amounts of money but weve got to the stage now where we require a greater deal if we are going to challenge the liverpools chelseas arsenals manchester uniteds
7273947 that is not withstanding the fact of trying to stay ahead of the aston villas and the tottenhams who are flushed with it money
7273948 im still positive that ill have a new contract to deal with shortly i want to get this week out of the way before the transfer window closes
7273949 there is that much going on now i couldnt put that into the middle of this week on the agenda thats for sure
7273950 the situation is just the same i am fine ill have a contract there is a contract there ive spoken to the chairman bill kenwright when we get around to doing it it is available to do
7273951 i thought we were good against everton we kept trying to do what we do it is about playing the way we believe in and i think the team did that
7273952 we gave everton plenty of problems we stand here disappointed that we didnt win the match but that is football everton base their success on being difficult to break down
7273953 we found that against portsmouth in the fa cup semi final last season we dominated for long spells and ended up losing
7273954 premier league sides are hard to score against we are not going to score 100 goals this year like last season but when we do create chances we have got to try and take a high percentage of them
7273955 after such a bad result we have come here to a new track and we did a fantastic job
7273956 to get pole take the win and have the fastest lap you cant do any more i am so glad and happy after the disaster in hungary
7273957 it was a shame to fight with him in the pit lane
7273958 we were side by side i was the lead car and he the lapped car but the gap was narrow and i didnt want to take much of a risk
7273959 i had to back off and i lost time but fortunately it was not too much
7273960 ive had a few problems health wise but ive pulled through
7273961 it was a hot weekend and i didnt have enough water it was like driving in a sauna but im pretty happy with the way ive come through it
7273962 the team has got some solid points me and heikki and it has been a solid weekend for us
7273963 its third but quite far away from the top two

7273971 after very healthy gains on wall street on friday at face value it looks like it will be a very good day for our market
7273972 the waxing and waning weve seen between the financials and resources is going to continue
7273973 whether it is big or small will depend on how hard qantas comes back to respond to air nzs pricing moves
7273974 what i found alarming is that a lot of countries have a negative view of us
7273975 they see us as a mini america which is clearly not the case
7273976 it has still a long way to run and im not sure that it has bottomed out yet
7273977 our preference would be not to hold them but im not sure we are going to sell them at 49c
7273978 i just dont think its what you would call a core holding in an institutional portfolio
7273979 a result of a mutually agreed decision by the asx and abc to prevent trading in an uninformed market
7273980 not only extraordinarily wasteful but border ing on the scandalous
7273981 some of the remarks i am going to make by way of introduction are not necessarily directed at people at the bar table but they are made in the hope they will assist you in your dealings with those who instruct you and perhaps those who instruct them
7273982 i agree with my learned friend that its not as bad as it looks
7273983 it may be for example that its not necessary to read the whole of the judgment in advance
7273984 with internet and satellite tv today the kids in areas like russia are as informed about trends and brands and music as anyone
7273985 weve seen in finland and other scandinavian countries that while sunlight is limited as soon as there is a warm day the kids are into their t shirt
7273986 i dont think its any different in russia there are summer resorts right through the former soviet union
7273987 there are very few suitable retailers we would want our product presented in
7273988 we would be looking for a street with reasonable profile
7273989 we sell considerable amounts in eastern europe and it continues to increase
7273990 ik moet het allemaal nog een beetje gaan beseffen maar dat zal de komende uren of dagen wel komen ik eerst nog wel een paar rondjes ga rennen en springen
7273991 dit zijn de spelen ik heb hier lang en hard voor gewerkt je wilt dat het eruit komt maar vorige week lukte dat niet
7273992 ongelooflijk ik ben gewoon olympisch kampioen echt extra bijzonder het bewijst dat je ook na zon ziekte goud kunt winnen
7273993 ik stond stijf van de stress nog nooit heb ik zo onder spanning gestaan voortdurend moest ik mezelf inpeperen rustig te blijven zo ben ik nog nooit geweest

7273995 it is difficult to understand how the council could continue to approve further and further das and amended das with so many non compliances on a large site
7273996 ive had him into my house a few times to discuss the plans
7273997 i must say in theory if someone buys a house on a block of land theyre entitled to knock it down and build a house all im saying is theyve got to build it within the rules
7273998 im just pissed off with the council i think karedis is doing what every homeowner tries to do to get the best house he can on the site in theory if he can get away with a few things with council he will
7273999 the worst thing is theres a lovely norfolk pine on the property
7274000 the only thing left on the site is the pine theyve excavated to within a metre of it we say youre going to kill it its affecting his view its in his interests for the tree to vanish itd be in my interests if i wasnt a person that likes trees

7274005 i have watched caseys career from the time he first came in he has always impressed me i have stood there and watched races with his dad he almost won the michigan race one time and i think i was pulling for you about as hard as i was pulling for our cars we are proud to have him and for jack daniels we couldnt be happier for everything they have done for the sport what we are going to do with our cheerios hamburger helper chevrolet a great group of people to work with and very patient with rcr and so is jack daniels now i want to introduce our driver of the no 33 cheerios hamburger helper chevrolet clint bowyer

7274008 i have a lot to focus on the remainder of this season and i am going to focus hard on that i want to finish the season off strong but as soon as that season is over i am going to start focusing on this direction and look forward to getting started on it
7274009 we are going to be just fine weve did a lot of research and looked in to a lot of different things at this time we really cant say what the plan is but we are definitely working on a few things
7274010 it is like i told him richard beats beatin dents in the body shop

7274012 we are working on all of that at this time like i said we arent going to get in to all of that we are evaluating every direction we have some really good plans at this time were not going to say what we are doing there because we have to concentrate on the next three weeks this is really important this is an important day for all of us bringing casey on and jack daniels staying with us and general mills with laura rather and her group over here it is a special day but we all know what work we have cut out for us for the next three weeks we have been working on this fourth team for quite a while and we have some great plans and no matter which way we go it is going to be successful

7274025 the ecb supports the decision of the icc to postpone the champions trophy until october 2009
7274026 the ecb made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that the ecb had a duty to care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7274027 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries at yesterdays teleconference
7274028 the ecb recognises the outstanding efforts of the pakistan cricket board in attempting to mitigate the risks surrounding the champions trophy and i will be meeting with the incoming chairman of the pcb once an appointment is made to discuss ways that our two boards can work together in the future
7274029 thought of not playing for middlesex and not playing at lords was one i couldnt really come to terms with with the potential in the current squad i am sure that we can seriously challenge for honours in the next few years
7274030 it is great news that a player as highly regarded as owais has committed his future to middlesex i am sure we can build on the success achieved this year with players of his quality in our side

7274055 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges the problem was identified after complaints from ohio elections officials following the march primary there but the logic error that is the root of the problem has been part of the software for 10 years said chris riggall a spokesman for premier election solutions formerly known as diebold

7274085 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7274086 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7274087 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7274088 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7274089 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7274090 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7274091 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7274092 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7274093 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first
7274094 we dont say that anymore after what they did to us
7274095 did we go to them to fight no they came to us they used to be our neighbors now they are foreigners

7274149 lewis and nicole are getting pretty serious were hearing that they may be about to buy a place together
7274150 it would only be a part time base because lewis is based in switzerland
7274151 i object to all this sex on the television i mean i keep falling off
7274152 she changes everything she touches and everything she touches changes
7274153 im disappointed that we played so well for so long without reward
7274154 okay glentoran put us under a bit of pressure but that was to be expected its a team pushing for league titles but when you go down to ten men its always going to be difficult
7274155 i would say the first half performance was very rusty and thats credit to lisburn distillery they probably controlled the first half then second half i said a few things at half time we came out and looked more positive were disappointed with the result probably more so with the performance in the first half
7274156 i thought we were clinical in the first half and extremely professional when glenavon tried to come at us in the second half
7274157 we made them play from side to side and when they put the ball in the air to try and get at us we dealt superbly with it
7274158 i think the fact that crusaders had played two competitive games before us showed in the first 20 minutes
7274159 its disappointing because we talked about certain things that crusaders would do especially their corner kicks and we didnt do what we had talked about doing
7274160 i can take positives from this especially our second half performance but its a kick up the backside for us
7274161 he is a hard worker and has pace it was a big day for him hes a shankill road man who always wanted to play for the blues and to score the winning goal on his home debut was a big moment for him
7274162 while we passed the ball well and retained it we didnt create much
7274163 we deserved more than what we got our keeper really had only one save to make
7274164 im just glad that im able to being something home to everyone who has supported me and cheered me on throughout these olympics
7274165 its fantastic to be bringing home a medal but i always believed in my own ability i was disappointed with the judges scoring in the semi final i think the crowd played a big part
7274166 your initial aim is to qualify for the olympics but then once you are here you want to win a medal and thankfully i was able to do that
7274167 i hope therell be a few more when i get home
7274168 wayne and hugh both went on to have very good professional careers after the olympics but im still not sure what path ill be taking i might hang around for london 2012
7274169 were all just so proud of him hes come to the olympics and really done the business
7274170 qualifying for beijing was a big achievement so to have gone on and won a medal is something very special the whole experience has been phenomenal weve had so many messages of support from back home and were very grateful to everyone for getting behind paddy
7274171 hopefully now the sporting bodies can put a decent package in place to enable paddy to stay amateur and go for gold at london 2012 hes already had approaches to turn professional but i would love him to put his pro career at least on hold but the lad has to live and im just hoping that common sense prevails in terms of funding
7274172 i specialise in a business pool which includes belfast and scotland and im proud to describe myself as a loyalist and a unionist
7274173 a wide range of organisations come to us because we provide management training and marketing skills
7274174 when the bnp contacted us i had no option but to work with them it was an exciting business proposal
7274175 i understand the truth truck could soon be on its way to northern ireland but thats nothing to do with me
7274176 the bnp are not an illegal organisation so why shouldnt i work with them i dont think their members are involved in criminal activity
7274177 i have worked in northern ireland for a long time but not for any proscribed organisations the bnp is not a proscribed organisation
7274178 it would be wrong for me to pontificate about the views of the bnp and i honestly cant think of anyone i wouldnt work with
7274179 dowsons marketing plan is nothing more than a begging letter
7274180 the bnp is in very serious financial trouble and this is how they think they can get money
7274181 the bnp may not be illegal but they articulate views which clearly motivate people to commit very serious attacks on minorities
7274182 there is an element of inciting hatred there is no attraction in northern ireland for this type of politics and i would discourage this party from coming over here we have always had good race relations in northern ireland there may be the odd incident but that does not represent the majority of people here
7274183 it is lucky that many of the devices they have been using have failed to explode for various reasons the real danger is they only have to succeed once
7274184 until recently they had been largely only targeting commercial centres and police stations in fermanagh with large devices but have switched tactics to attempt to murder police officers
7274185 however we are well aware of who is behind this and there is a hardcore of around a dozen members
7274186 my life was just a living hell after i was accused of this
7274187 imagine being blamed for setting fire to the home of someone who had lost three nephews in an arson attack
7274188 i couldnt believe it when the police came to my door and arrested me for a terrible crime
7274189 i have a clear record and would never ever dream of doing something like this
7274190 i couldnt even attend my uncles funeral with this thing hanging over me and im just so pleased my name has been cleared once and for all
7274191 this man was a friend of mine and i never ever thought i would be accused of doing something like this after we had a stupid falling out i couldnt even work with this stigma hanging over me but im getting back on my feet now and am just looking to the future
7274192 i would hate for any innocent man to experience what i went through the whole episode was awful and just a waste of resources for the legal system
7274193 anyone who knows me knew from the start that i was not capable of such an offence
7274194 i have a clear record and my conscience is also clear i cant thank the people enough who stood by me during these very difficult two years
7274195 i had nothing but sympathy for the quinn children and theres no way i would set out to do something like this to a family
7274196 as far as im concerned this matter is now resolved and i now just want to claim back the two years of my life which i lost when the police came to my door
7274197 but i was put out because of the trouble in the area and i ended up homeless
7274198 this was the perfect chance to rebuild our lives to start again and now were back to square one
7274199 it was absolutely disgusting my house stank the next day and the most unimaginable things could be seen just floating down the street during the flooding
7274200 we were worried about getting sick and before environmental health were called the firemen were advising us to wash with disinfectant afterwards
7274201 i know we have a house to stay in for the minute and a cheque for a thousand pounds but none of us had home insurance
7274202 and it doesnt begin to cover the cost of the daily essentials that have been destroyed
7274203 the temporary house has a washing machine and cooker but we do not even have a sofa in the living room to sit on
7274204 i didnt really know what was happening until the water was already coming into my house
7274205 i didnt know what to lift first so i grabbed my daughter and put her upstairs with the dog to see what i could save
7274206 but by the time i did that it was too late it got everything in my home i was too busy worrying about jenny to save anything
7274207 jenny doesnt understand why her toys arent there and why she has no dvds to watch before going to bed
7274208 its had a profound effect on her she cant comprehend the situation like other people all she knows is that we cant go back home and she doesnt have many of her favourite toys anymore
7274209 she had to be lifted from the house by the firemen and that was quite traumatising for her my mum walked behind in the water to try and make her feel at ease
7274210 i was just in shock all weekend i just couldnt think straight and then they told us that everything had to go that had been touched by the water
7274211 it was devastating they were telling me i had to dump all of our belongings but we had no idea of how we were going to replace even the most basic of things the 1 000 we will get wont cover it
7274212 it was like in slow motion we watched it build up on the road and then up the path we kept
7274213 i used tea towels every towel in the house house coats anything that would soak up the water
7274214 but we were fighting a losing battle i had heard it gurgling in the toilet downstairs and went to check on it
7274215 by the time i arrived in the kitchen it was already ankle deep
7274216 there is just me and my 15 year old son adam in the house but we had to gather people together to help the neighbours
7274217 the man on one side of me is in a wheelchair he only has one leg
7274218 the woman on the other side has a son who is severely mentally and physically disabled everyone was trying to help each other it was just panic stations
7274219 i went upstairs to get something and the children were playing in the living room
7274220 the next thing i heard all this splashing and couldnt work out where it was coming from
7274221 when i went downstairs there they were playing in the flooding coming into my home like it was normal i didnt know what to do the first floor of my house was covered in four feet of water and sewage
7274222 im here by myself all my family are in england
7274223 i was very lucky that people pulled together to help me
7274224 ive had to throw out everything that was in the bottom floor of my house food washing machine furniture everything that belongs to me
7274225 it will be months before i can get back in my house
7274226 were going to get there i know we will this whole thing is unravelling and we are working from the outside in to bring these people to justice
7274227 witnesses to crimes and victims of crimes committed by these people who may have been afraid to speak out in the past are now coming forward
7274228 for example we intend to talk to people who escaped from this gang after they tried to kill them we will be asking people who shot them
7274229 the crimes under investigation include sectarian murders feud killings punishment shootings and other serious crimes that these people were involved in
7274230 our investigations are focused on forensic applications and there are a good number of cases we can progress because of the advances in science and technology
7274231 i could have been in retirement now but i took an undertaking to bring these people to justice and i intent to fulfil it for the fam ilies who are paramount in our investigations
7274232 there are people who were on the fringes of this group and who may have helped planned serious crimes such as murder if these people dont come to us with information then we will go after them
7274233 but this investigation is about going after the major players who committed serious acts of crime over many years
7274234 witness protection schemes are in place and people should not be afraid to come forward because we will protect them
7274235 we are positive of the government legislation we intend to use to bring these people before the courts and we also intend to link various crimes committed by these people since 1991 our work is ongoing and we will continue to explore the full range of criminality committed by this group
7274236 although my sisters murder was before the good friday agreement i still believe that the people who killed her should be jailed
7274237 they may only do a short period of time for her murder but if they are in jail for other offences then they could end up being behind bars for a long time
7274238 i was told a couple weeks ago that there would be arrests and this wouldnt come as a surprise to me the victims families will be meeting again with the het to discuss the progress which has been made
7274239 we still deserve justice after all these years and we hope the het can help us achieve this aim
7274240 the killers of my son and other victims should realise that they wont get away with what they did over the years
7274241 i know the family may never forgive me for what happened but i honestly didnt mean for that fella to die
7274242 it was a stupid row over a girl it was a fight that got out of hand and something that i will have to live with for the rest of my life
7274243 i was trying to protect myself by picking up the knife i stabbed him in the arm i didnt mean for the knife to go through and strike his chest
7274244 im not looking for sympathy i just wanted to let the family know that i really am sorry for what happened that night if i could turn back the clock i would
7274245 im willing to meet them to show that im sincere and to show genuine remorse for what i did not a day goes by when i dont think about that night
7274246 ive undergone different classes in jail and when i get out the only thing i want to concentrate on is getting a job and getting on with my life
7274247 im not going to be anywhere near banbridge im going to be on probation for three and a half years and the last thing im going to do is jeopardise this
7274248 the anger management courses ive been on have really helped me and im no danger to anyone
7274249 ive paid for what ive done people shouldnt be afraid when im released back into society im no cold blooded killer i just want to be left alone when i leave prison
7274250 i went for parole but i didnt get it and i dont understand why i have kept my head down in prison and have stuck to the courses
7274251 i know ill have to wait until next february before im out i will have paid my debt to society by then and believe i deserve a second chance
7274252 why is this killer intent on causing more damage to our family with this pathetic insult its hard for me to respond to this thug
7274253 when he was jailed for my sons killing he was smirking and laughing at me in court his apology to me is nothing but an insult he never gave christopher a thought when he stabbed him and people should realise this
7274254 christopher was only in that house 10 minutes and look what happened to him hes already taken a member of my familys life theres no reason why he couldnt do it again when hes released
7274255 jail doesnt change people like him it still disturbs me greatly what happened to my son it has had a massive impact on me
7274256 magee is not a good person and i dont know why hes saying these things now the person he cares about is himself
7274257 the fact that hes saying hes participating in a number of programmes is irrelevent because the court ordered him to do this
7274258 he had a capacity for violence before he attacked christopher why is he doing all this now
7274259 this man took my sons life yet the system only charged him with manslaughter he should have been charged with murder and be spending life behind bars
7274260 there was blood all over me i still remember christopher lying on the ground and this image will never leave me his eyes were just glazed
7274261 i gave christopher first aid and magee was still behind he had pure hatred in his eyes and i thought he was going to attack me as i held christopher in my arms
7274262 magee just stood there and didnt care what he had done i know what i witnessed that night as far as im concerned he should have been on trial for murder
7274263 im very worried about this man being released because i think he could do this again
7274264 we had no idea a simple book launch or a book tour in the states was not possible
7274265 it means us readers will be denied the opportunity to meet mr mcintyre and learn first hand about the situation in northern ireland if gerry adams and ian paisley can travel to the us to discuss the progress being made in northern ireland as a result of the good friday agreement why cant mr mcintyre
7274266 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7274267 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7274268 carters appointment isnt until the end of october but in my heart i know we must go now
7274269 if we wait any longer his condition will only get worse and he might not be able to make the journey
7274270 carters life is at risk the longer we leave it and i believe this is our only chance
7274271 its agony for carter and heartbreaking to watch him go through all this
7274272 hes been so brave and there have been times when i thought i was going to lose my precious son
7274273 now im just hoping he will be well enough to make the flight on tuesday
7274274 people have been marvellous and when i last checked with the bank there was 16 000 in the account
7274275 when carter does get to see dr douglas nordli head of the chicago clinic he will have three tests carried out costing around 9 500 dollars there will be a video eeg over 24 hours an mri scan and a genetic consultation
7274276 then if carter is admitted and put on a new dietary regime it will cost us around 1 600 dollars a day
7274277 its so expensive but the level of treatment and expertise carter needs is just not available in northern ireland or even the mainland
7274278 on top of that ill have to find an apartment and naturally all the day to day living expenses
7274279 i know im on a wing and a prayer but ill go to the ends of the earth to see that carter gets this treatment
7274280 this is my son he didnt ask to be born with this condition but he has incredible strength of character
7274281 when we started out i though people would have far too much on their plate to bother with us
7274282 but we were desperate and the reward has been the incredible response from ordinary people on the street weve been amazed and peoples letters and emails have been so supportive
7274283 its carters journey of hope and were praying it will give him the opportunity of a real and rewarding life
7274284 lesley certainly has baggage thats for sure she has become involved in the church and that is where she has met her latest man
7274285 they seem happy together and him with her children and are planning to wed in the near future
7274286 i feel morally responsible for the death of my husband because of the affair i had
7274287 regardless of wealth the priory can provide services at any time to any member of the public

7274290 we kregen daar veel verontwaardigde reacties op van duitsers het is over de hele wereld uitgezonden en het enige land waar men er problemen mee had is uitgerekend duitsland
7274291 he has been working with me for about six years and this arrest has hit me like a sledgehammer
7274292 he is obviously innocent until proven guilty and we will be taking an interest in the case
7274293 i wont be able to comment further until the case has been concluded
7274294 its hard to believe that a councillor has been charged with such a serious offence and we will have to wait and see what happens

7274299 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
7274300 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
7274301 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
7274302 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
7274303 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
7274304 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
7274305 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
7274306 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
7274307 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
7274308 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
7274309 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country

7274317 the past 16 days have witnessed superb athletic performances and sportsmanship
7274318 let us pay tribute to all those who have participated in the games
7274319 the olympic flame atop the national stadium will soon extinguish and yet the chinese peoples enthusiasm in embracing the world will be ablaze forever
7274320 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7274321 simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7274322 london will be the city of the country that has invented modern sport and has invented the rules of sport and has brought in the values of fair play

7274365 the icc board today agreed unanimously to postpone the champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan from sept 12 until october 2009
7274366 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board pcb and the situation it finds itself in
7274367 however there was also a realisation that under the circumstances some of the teams had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7274368 under the circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 and we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

7274371 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7274372 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7274373 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7274374 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints

7274538 os governos gastam milh es em autopromo o por ano n o vejo problema em usar essa fonte para impedir que uma crian a fique cega
7274539 provamos justi a que havia necessidade urg ncia e justificativa t cnica para a cirurgia se seu filho estivesse para ficar cego voc se conformaria em esperar
7274540 sempre que h uma decis o neste sentido cumprimos o que houve neste caso foi mesmo a falta de condi es cl nicas do paciente
7274541 disponibilizarile vor fi voluntare si vor fi impartite egal intre cele doua fabrici localizate in statul victoria
7274542 the programme policies and other issues will be clear soon
7274543 we did not discuss seat sharing but how to evolve the organisation third front together
7274544 in a large family minor frictions are always there but we all are together
7274545 at this hour of crisis i am not interested in indulging in blame game and prepared to help the state government in mitigating the problems of flood affected people
7274546 we are prepared for this and we are expecting a formal announcement at the teleconference
7274547 terrorism is a problem all over the world it is not just limited to pakistan and keeping this in mind we have made the best possible security arrangements for the champions trophy in consultation with the icc security people so how can countries now say they cant come to pakistan
7274548 apparently australia new zealand and england have also unofficially conveyed to the icc they wouldnt be sending their teams we now want a weeks delay in the final decision as the government says it will get involved and use diplomatic channels to convince the four countries
7274549 sports minister najmuddin khan and top officials will meet ambassadors of the four countries and try to convince them that the government is committed to providing the highest level of security for participating teams
7274550 a number of options were discussed in case champions trophy is to be shifted from pakistan or postponed one of them is that pakistan will remain hosts and in conjunction with the icc and organisers in abu dhabi sharjah and dubai will hold the event there
7274551 this option is viable as the three emirates states are also interested in such a proposal and they have facilities to host an international event if not immediately but in a few months time
7274552 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7274553 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7274554 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7274555 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7274556 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7274557 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7274558 er is beslist op basis van verwachtingspatronen die nergens kunnen worden gegarandeerd ik snap niet dat gs zich er voor lenen om op basis daarvan toestemming te verlenen in ogenschouw nemend dat een ongeruste bevolking massaal en heel duidelijk kenbaar heeft gemaakt deze oven niet te willen en de reactie van gs daarop vraag ik me af of zelfs de echo van verkiezingsbeloften al is verstomd die beloften blijken dus geen cent waard te zijn
7274559 yes i know its illegal but hey it was fun
7274560 then we moved on to the paca and the hedgehog
7274561 robin though she was there until the end not much she cant handle had to think of something special easy in the end though left her alone in a thread with nice people like freddie sarah and fairyhedgehog didnt last five minutes
7274562 there can be more discussions and the number of unwilling farmers determined
7274563 the government will place its papers and they opposition will give their documents and in this manner a solution will be found to the singur deadlock
7274564 the chief minister should continue the dialogue the dialogue should not stop
7274565 our agitation will be peaceful and it will be a movement for the suffering masses
7274566 i would like rsp and forward bloc to join the dharna
7274567 we have already offered a solution package to the west bengal government to resolve the crisis in the interest of both agriculture and industry
7274568 but ive asked my party workers not to go for confrontation
7274569 it is for the individual industrialists to decide where they want to set up their industry
7274570 we hope the agitation will remain peaceful as the local leaders have assured verbally that they will not resort to violence
7274571 we believe that the local leaders will keep their word that nobody will indulge in violence

7274607 politics is always a changing thing and doors for talks should not be shut but the final decision rests on individuals or parties
7274608 in the last 10 years there really has been almost a revolutionary change in the opinions and the views of women regarding menstruation
7274609 its not just the more mature reproductive women desiring fewer withdrawal bleeds
7274610 now thats becoming a more common desire among even younger women seeking hormonal contraception
7274611 the only difference recently is that we have these dedicated products

7274628 in the first half we were very good and had three or four chances to score and the goal in the last minute wasnt offside so we were very unlucky

7274663 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7274664 do you think that islam limits muslims to fully integrate themselves into a western society like sweden
7274665 yes yes i think muslims can integrate assimilation no integration yes the problem is that christians dont know much about islam muslims know much more about christianity and judaism
7274666 before i left he cautioned me about the growing gulf between young muslims and native swedes many people accuse islam and young muslims have had enough the conflict starts because young muslims want to defend islam they want swedes to know they are not terrorists its ignorance about islam that breeds conflict
7274667 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

7274674 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7274675 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7274676 i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly my heart aches for my wife and for our family for their loss on the other hand i am extremely proud and happy for my team
7274677 those are the two emotions i have and they are a little bit conflicted obviously

7274679 se inscribe dentro del inter s que el ministerio y las fuerzas de seguridad del estado tienen en que no quede ning n acto de violencia callejera impune en el pa s vasco y en navarra
7274680 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7274681 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7274682 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year

7274703 what is most important for the nominees from iran heading to the annual academy awards is the issue of content
7274704 i believe behzadis we only live twice is a good movie but this film is somehow the repetition of martin scorseses taxi driver produced 30 years ago in the united states and has lost its appeal for the american people
7274705 mirkarimis so simple features the position of a woman in the traditional society of iran although the movie doesnt have a feministic outlook it portrays a kind of bitter image of iranian women which captures the attention of the world
7274706 since the movie focuses on the issue of war which is a world wide issue these days it could be a good choice
7274707 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7274708 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7274709 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters

7274721 its about showing the true and tolerant face of the people of bristol and the south west standing together
7274722 not to denigrate the tv show but nobody ever died
7274723 we drove cars off cliffs and people got out and walked away were not going to do that in the movie in this the tone is more dangerous you can really die its very tense and exciting

7274740 our research tells us consumers have about five or six reasons for wanting local freshness and taste keeping farmland in the community and having open spaces a desire to be close to the food source and know where it comes from support of local farmers and keeping money in the community embedded in all of this is concern about food safety all this creates pretty powerful interest
7274741 82 percent of all customers told us loud and clear locally grown produce tastes better we have over 200 farmers selling over 50 different commodities primarily from june through september
7274742 regional agriculture systems in the northeast mid atlantic and southeast are really quite broken
7274743 small farmers can sell direct but there is no infrastructure for middle sized farmers to get stuff into supermarkets

7274745 its an entire generation thats been lost in the shuffle and its a generation thats very different from the one before it and the one after

7274747 the lucky few between the greatest generation and the baby boom
7274748 but after the war those tough times evaporated and the reality exceeded their expectations so they felt really lucky

7274767 the great lakes is undoubtedly one of the unique and most interesting waterways of the world yet the area has been overlooked by cruise companies
7274768 the great lakes offer numerous attractions including vibrant and dynamic cities natural attractions unspoiled vistas historic sites and man made wonders such as the welland canal one of the worlds greatest engineering achievements and the ports of embarkation for the cruise are easily and onveniently accessible from every part of the country

7274770 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7274771 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7274772 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7274773 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7274774 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7274775 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7274776 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7274777 the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries under the carbon market mechanism has been a stormy one among delegates and observers
7274778 there is a point where it will be too late it is better we speed up to make appreciable progress in the negotiations
7274779 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7274780 the negotiations are focusing excessively on finance and not on the root causes of deforestation such as consumption of biofuels meat and timber
7274781 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions

7274790 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in

7274794 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7274795 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well

7274825 the practice of the treasury in giving to the finder the intrinsic value of the objects found virtually concedes the principle of their being his property but at the same time does not prevent the constant concealment and destruction of coins and other antiquities for the mere fact of a claim to them being advanced accompanied though this may be by the promise of payment for them of an unknown sum at a period always indefinite and often remote suffices in many cases to deter finders from openly producing the results of their discoveries and drives them to dispose of such relics clandestinely

7274829 having convinced the supreme court that lies were truth and that nonexistent evidence presented good grounds to uphold the life sentence the attorney general was assigned to investigate the case
7274830 the attorney general cannot be expected to do justice since it has a vested interest in protecting the original unjust conviction and supreme court opinion
7274831 we do not believe there is any basis for disqualification of this office and it would seem that the court agrees
7274832 accordingly we are actively pursuing our investigation of the murder of peggy hettrick
7274833 so what if the case was dismissed masters is still a suspect and a wrongfully convicted person has every right to be concerned that the evidence that was used to secure 9 years of his life in a prison is maintained appropriately with the proper chain of custody and that evidence isnt lost or mishandled as it was by fort collins pd

7274840 i knew how good aiden was when i left but he has improved a hell of a lot
7274841 he has pretty much everything now the final delivery the shot or pass he has that end product to his game now
7274842 and he scares the life out of defenders when he starts running at them
7274843 if the players make runs ahead of him then he will find them
7274844 the pace of the team as we are breaking is different from when i was last here especially with some of the attacking players we have
7274845 the energy is also different the midfield two paul hartley and scott brown were up against a falkirk central midfield three and that is quite difficult but they coped very well
7274846 i will take the positives out of it one or two of young players got a taste of it and sometimes to blood one or two you have to take a hit
7274847 were trying all routes there might be some buys and there might be some loans but i said that six weeks ago and nothing has so far happened
7274848 it is the last days of the sales and there is not much left
7274849 i hope to try and get maybe a couple of players in but for the quality i need us to get to continue forward i dont know if you can get someone with a few days to go
7274850 i need to add mainly midfield and forward players to the squad our defenders today were the reason we got a result
7274851 i feel as if ive let the players down ive got a real good relationship with the players and they know how i work
7274852 i got people like tim cahill mikel arteta joleon lescott phil jagielka leon osman tony hibbert phil neville all to build and have a group together on the understanding im going to progress everton and make them better
7274853 at the moment at this summer im not progressing everton so i feel as if im letting them down
7274854 my ambition is to develop everton every year ive been here i feel i developed this is the first summer where i dont feel ive made any progress
7274855 my ambition is that i want to challenge the top managers in the league
7274856 weve not had massive amounts of money but weve got to the stage now where we require a greater deal if we are going to challenge the liverpools chelseas arsenals manchester uniteds
7274857 that is not withstanding the fact of trying to stay ahead of the aston villas and the tottenhams who are flushed with it money
7274858 im still positive that ill have a new contract to deal with shortly i want to get this week out of the way before the transfer window closes
7274859 there is that much going on now i couldnt put that into the middle of this week on the agenda thats for sure
7274860 the situation is just the same i am fine ill have a contract there is a contract there ive spoken to the chairman bill kenwright when we get around to doing it it is available to do
7274861 i thought we were good against everton we kept trying to do what we do it is about playing the way we believe in and i think the team did that
7274862 we gave everton plenty of problems we stand here disappointed that we didnt win the match but that is football everton base their success on being difficult to break down
7274863 we found that against portsmouth in the fa cup semi final last season we dominated for long spells and ended up losing
7274864 premier league sides are hard to score against we are not going to score 100 goals this year like last season but when we do create chances we have got to try and take a high percentage of them

7274872 as more of the production workload becomes virtualised and those managing virtual servers continue to be overwhelmed it is apparent that automated configuration control must play a larger role to ensure appropriate server configuration and adequate security

7274884 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
7274885 its like treacle in january at the moment its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
7274886 well wait and see and if we can bring them in then all well and good but if not well go with what weve got now
7274887 despite a doubling of efforts in the sale of the 1 000 syndicate tickets sligo rovers have so far only managed to gather 44 000 of their targeted 130 000
7274888 the club is now appealing to all the people of sligo and beyond to come along to fill the showgrounds for our next two home games against drogheda united on august 30 and bohemians on september 5
7274889 we are also asking all those who normally pay the 15 entry fee season ticket holders committee members stewards press and anyone who comes to the next two home games to make a 20 voluntary contribution to the club

7274892 what happened last week was a big loser for us and racing on saturday was far from pleasant in the conditions
7274893 but we dont want to go out with a whimper and well probably look for two or three days late in september or early in october and give it one more shot
7274894 we will certainly do our best to salvage what we can for tralee because of what has happened due to the very bad weather
7274895 hes an old charlton player hes loved by the fans here and his experience and character will add to what weve got
7274896 i am going to have a chat with mr cecil and well make a plan during the week we will keep our options open a little while longer
7274897 the pressure is the same when you want to win the goal is still the same and the pressure the same
7274898 im very happy to be number one its a big satisfaction after a long time being number two but at the same time nothing changes
7274899 this is the last grand slam of the season so its going to be very important for everybody
7274900 i thought of making it the newspaper report into a film but may be making it into a way that its like a fable with morals and things like that but unlike moral it has a lot of surprises but basically its about a journey of a boy who goes to find his donkey back and through his journey he meet all these interesting characters and its a very big tussle for the boy to go and get his donkey back so during this event there are so many things that happen
7274901 its the setting of the film about something that you can relate to because it is a place like kashmir which is always in the news for conflict and in todays world people relate to such things all over the world so it has a universal appeal too
7274902 maybe its a canada thing or maybe were just haters or maybe we hate canada

7274905 theres so much that will happen with that story because its 1300 years ago
7274906 this is my message to the leadership of the country we are with you as long as we are able to resolve the kashmir problem through dialogue peaceful means we are against violence any kind of violence be it from that side or this side we will not take it i repeat it again if there is a thought that we will suppress the peaceful protests through suppression by running around more security personnel i think we will not be this side then we will have to be on the side of the innocent people who are fighting for justice who are fighting for the resolution of the kashmir problem
7274907 the let lashkar e tayyaba militant is the cousin of iqbal malik and he is working with him only we have recovered 195 000 rupees from him

7274915 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7274916 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7274917 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7274918 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7274919 slave owners wanted our ancestors to think of themselves as nameless objects of property plain and simple like a chicken or a cow
7274920 i am convinced that this still impacts our people today crippling our ability to know ourselves by connecting with our familys past we have internalized generations of doubt and fears about who we are as a people and what we can accomplish just as white racists wanted us to do and we continue to pay a terrible price for this
7274921 i have long loved the written word and come to see in it the power of the sleeping lion
7274922 i will write down my story so that it waits like a restful beast with lungs breathing and heart beating
7274923 one of these people will find my story and pass it along and then i believe i will have lived for a reason
7274924 this needs to be addressed for the sake of our community
7274925 i had a couple of friends involved in putting that tower up and they knew it was the wind farm people seeing if it was a good spot everyone else thought it was a cellphone tower
7274926 the more i found out about them the more i believed them not to be good for this community my vision of this whole thing got broader and broader
7274927 my point of view was to get the information out there not to try and persuade anybody to change their mind another part of my policy was if im the lone voice in the wilderness if no one else agrees with me im not going to be the crazy person running around by myself but i never had to worry about that i had nothing but support
7274928 i called some friends who were actively interested in this three of us sat down and kicked around some ideas
7274929 i was a little disappointed at how complacent people were at first
7274930 this place has great meaning for those people who have been coming here for 40 50 years there was no way they were going to take this lying down
7274931 when i realized this was happening i thought its development you have to live with it
7274932 i sat down and wrote an open e mail i really agonized over it because i felt quite exposed i was going to put my opinion down and send it out to as many people as i could i very carefully said to my neighbours and fellow citizens im very concerned i feel i must reach out and find out if anyone thinks like me i felt as if i had no option that i had to do this
7274933 the mayor said that whoever would like to speak could stand and then he called on people at nine oclock the mayor ended the meeting while people were still standing and i was one of those people
7274934 the idea that there are people at the front of room who have the power and decision making control and theyre not listening i felt frustrated i had things to say that others had not contributed the idea that this would go through without any say by the public made my sense of justice rage
7274935 they dont just want to vote they want to do something else they want to feel like they can take part in the way our society is being shaped
7274936 its public land as far as im concerned the councillors do not own that land the citizens of this town own that public land just because we elected these people doesnt mean they can do what they want i believe that once you are elected you must continue to listen to your constituents and represent their desires not your own
7274937 we have to think about the limitations of our current system of democracy youre looking for ways outside the system to influence the system and one way to do that is to come together with others who have similar concerns in a specific area as an individual you can call your mla your mp and make those concerns heard but numbers were talking about having a critical mass of people coming to consensus ideally on an issue and making those voices heard or making changes themselves
7274938 this community is a pretty quiet community minded lovely tourist spot and i think we were all asleep we got complacent
7274939 ive got a desire for a new library here because im a library user
7274940 i noticed we needed a new library when i went into the childrens section and saw books piled in boxes because there is no shelf space
7274941 i think the fopl is a good example of what can be done with a bit of effort and will
7274942 they dont have the decision making power to make this happen alone but they do represent concerned citizens they are a good example of how a small group can make a difference
7274943 getting the interested parties together to form a plan to get funding
7274944 were not going to have the satisfaction of an aha gotcha moment
7274945 council has asked the developer to go back and draw up another proposal for the woods and fields
7274946 suddenly you have a neighbour upset with you because they dont agree with what youre doing
7274947 no one sets out to divide a community but thats the way it unfolded
7274948 im not against change and thats how its been interpreted but thats not what it is for me change just for changes sake without thinking about what youre sacrificing is foolish
7274949 i feel like i need to contribute to being part of how change happens
7274950 it was the biggest bang ive ever heard in my life
7274951 its a daunting task every year we go there and take the grandchildren there and the deterioration is quite visible
7274952 there was a road house a half way house a church up the road and the cemetery
7274953 people recognize the importance of the site and wed like to have it designated as a heritage site
7274954 its part of our history and respect for those who came before us
7274955 we moved the house about 50 to 75 feet away
7274956 in a case like yesterdays where there had been multiple warnings and incidents ahead of our actions
7274957 a lifeline to rural communities as such we have enlarged our ditching and gravelling programs in an effort to maintain a proper road system
7274958 trim the fat which has grown up around government spending
7274959 we can only build that new and better tomorrow if we fully appreciate the terrible mess we are in today
7274960 creates one civilian job in a support or service industry
7274961 no single monument structure or interpretive complex can do justice
7274962 we are confident we have a product superior to similar north american magazines and one that is more appropriate to canadian youngsters
7274963 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
7274964 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
7274965 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
7274966 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new polls obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counselling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
7274967 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
7274968 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favourites its so easy to get the press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
7274969 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris hilton britney spears ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
7274970 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
7274971 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
7274972 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
7274973 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
7274974 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
7274975 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
7274976 hes starting a blistering tv campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism
7274977 now john you know that every time he tries to get tough he quickly runs out of gas sometimes in debates hed be exhausted by the third question he must use up all his energy in the gym he doesnt have any stamina and he certainly doesnt have our bloodlust besides you can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos
7274978 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me
7274979 that was inspired to snatch his convention away makes him look so weak listen why dont you stop in sedona on the way to denver wear a black wig and ill spirit you up to the cabin for the night ill catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you it will be an adventure

7274995 life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
7274996 its two or three times what theyre spending in any other industrialized country but if you look at quality based on disability adjusted life years the international yardstick combining mortality and morbidity were ranked dead last so the europeans said why is health care going up at this extraordinary rate in the united states
7274997 back surgery spinal fusions and were not sure what else

7275144 e normale essere amareggiati dopo questa sconfitta perch la coppa italia era un nostro obiettivo purtroppo dice il centrocampista palermitano che ieri ha giocato una buonissima partita quando concedi due gol di vantaggio ad una squadra come il ravenna dura da recuperare specie se ancora la squadra in fase di rodaggio noi ci abbiamo provato se analizziamo bene la partita il palermo ha avuto alcune occasioni per rimediare oltre al gol di cavani ma se siamo usciti sconfitti significa che gli errori sono stati superiori ai nostri meriti luned ci ritroveremo per capire dove effettivamente abbiamo sbagliato il nostro allenatore bravissimo e sar lui a dirci cosa dobbiamo migliorare in questa settimana continua liverani bisogner lavorare per presentarci a udine nella migliore condizione possibile la difesa non mi piace parlare dei singoli sostiene il nostro capitano perch la mia esperienza mi porta a capire che quando si sbaglia lo si fa in undici tuttavia non sono preoccupato cos come ero esaltato per le vittorie nelle amichevoli precampionato ed per questo che invito i tifosi a non abbattersi per questo passo falso loro giustamente ci hanno fischiato nel loro diritto torneranno ad applaudire la squadra quando ricomincer a fare bene
7275145 he wasnt listed in the starting team and also wasnt listed on the bench
7275146 i knew that he was warming up before the game so i just asked the referee and roar coach frank farina what was going on they told me he was having a test i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7275147 i was pretty pleased with the way we played both first half and second half
7275148 but as i said to the boys weve got to close those games out
7275149 if were serious about doing something this year those sorts of ones youve got to close them out when youve got them on the ropes like we had them
7275150 youve got to do it now particularly with the cancels we had
7275151 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us
7275152 under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it

7275157 we had nine goalscorers today and the spread was a lot better than perhaps it has been
7275158 from our point of view we just play and when he gets the goals he gets the goals if he happens to get on the end of them great but we are more interested in hawthorn kicking the goals necessarily than just one player
7275159 thats not ideal but we play in a very volatile and aggressive sport and we ask our players to play tough hard footy and sometimes that drags them a little bit closer to the line so theyre vulnerable to reports and suspensions

7275190 as in the past i looked to the unseen interior of the house to be the focus of unknown celebrations it was my wishful conviction that the inner world of the house participated after its own style in a kind of ceremonious desolation that translucent festivals might be glimpsed in the corners of certain rooms and that the faraway sounds of mad carnivals filled certain hallways at all hours of the day and night i am afraid however that a peculiar feature of the house prevented full indulgence in the usual anticipations this feature was a turret built into one side of the house and rising to an unusual height beyond its roof so that it looked out upon the world as a lighthouse diminishing the aspect of introspection that is vital to such structures and near the cone roofed peak of this turret a row of large windows appeared to have been placed as a later modification around its entire circumference but if the house was truly employing its windows to gaze outward more than within what it saw was nothing for all the windows of the three ample stories of the house as well as those of the turret and that small octagonal aperture in the attic were shuttered closed

7275204 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7275205 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7275206 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7275207 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7275208 anything that could possibly happen is talked about in the advance plan
7275209 its good to see that the space is here there could be nothing but its just a crumb
7275210 the civil disobedience is one of the heartier sections of our plans
7275211 but on the same token were hoping to provide a safe and enjoyable event for this historic event thats happening here
7275212 youve always got to plan for the worst and hope for the best
7275213 this is going to be a major change no matter how it comes out
7275214 the fact of an african american winning a major partys nomination is unprecedented its a difficult position to be in but so far hes been treading very carefully and i think successfully
7275215 i dont think i know he wants to be elected because hes a good president who happens to be black not because hes black and would like to be president
7275216 after a primary like this theres always more time needed to unify the party
7275217 but obamas going to win the nomination and hes going to make a hell of a speech
7275218 when i hear obama talking about change and a new direction it brings back to me some parallels
7275219 it was part of this whole momentum of moving forward of moving beyond
7275220 i think he has a very tough campaign ahead of him because a lot of ideas about race are very subliminal
7275221 what will they do when they get in the voting booth i dont think anybody really knows yet
7275222 theirs is going to be about history and ours is going to be about the future
7275223 obamas biggest problem is to recapture the excitement about the time he was in minneapolis in february when he was coming on strong
7275224 i think hes better off to just hammer on issues people really do care about it like jobs and the economy
7275225 in the end voters and black voters are more focused on making sure that someone who has their best interests in mind will win rather than voting for the first black president
7275226 title come see usa todays medal tables for the athens and beijing olympics recently there have been a lot of discussions about how to rank countries on their medal haul per gold or total medals some people insist that americans have always ranked countries according to total medals i checked out the usa today and here are the results bxbq does not know how to include pictures in a post screen shot of the different ways of ranking medal counts clearly demonstrate american double standard

7275231 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7275232 we started working on this project in 2002 foolishly intending for it to be released on the tenth anniversary of marvels
7275233 but that very quickly proved to be a pipe dream and from then on nobody wanted to compromise on the quality of the series
7275234 eye of the camera follows the life of phil sheldon through the course of marvel history
7275235 this story picks up shortly after marvels left off with phil getting some life altering news from there it continues forward intersecting and interacting with stories published in the 1970s and 1980s well also be seeing a few earlier moments that got skipped over in the original marvels
7275236 well be covering a broad spectrum of marvel events everything from the first appearance of the punisher in manhattan to the rise of monsters such as man thing and werewolf by night to the seeming death in dallas during fall of the mutants to secret wars ii and beyond
7275237 were going to be covering the entire tapestry of the marvel universe and juxtaposing it against the events in phils life and his experiences of being on the fringes of these events
7275238 there will be a hulk she hulk story and tales featuring skaar son of hulk scorpion and the genetic offspring of hulk and thundra from hulk raging thunder

7275240 we try to do around four hulk specials a year
7275241 hulk family is a title weve played around with a lot and we finally decided to pull the trigger we felt it would be a great place for readers to be introduced to some of the newer aspects of the hulk mythos
7275242 i dont want to spill the beans just yet but well be visiting some very interesting places from hulks past that i think will surprise the pants off of fans
7275243 we submitted a plot but we and the editors couldnt quite get on the same page so the project went away

7275262 i think he may have learned at that time that power is everything and weakness is nothing
7275263 there were plenty of warnings for anyone who was listening that there was going to be confrontation in the streets of chicago
7275264 the only question was how was it going to be handled and what would the ultimate outcome of it be
7275265 he had a great pride in chicago he had a great love for the city throw into that a good measure of his irish temper and you had a volatile mix
7275266 ribicoff stared down at daley looked him in the eye
7275267 the confrontation was created by the people who charged the police gentlemen get the thing straight once and for all the policeman isnt there to create disorder the policeman is there to preserve disorder
7275268 the democratic convention of 1968 was a disaster for the city of chicago it was a disaster for richard j daley and it was a disaster for the democratic party
7275269 the 68 convention left such a bad taste in the mouths of democrats all across the country that even party regulars were blaming richard j daley for the fate of the party losing the election in 68
7275270 chicagoans thought the way he handled those demonstrations was the way it ought to be handled
7275271 as a result of the convention in 1968 richard j daley could never be defeated in the city of chicago
7275272 the people of chicago admired him for being a strong leader
7275273 he saw chaos and he saw his dad lose control
7275274 i think he may have learned at that time that power is everything and weakness is nothing
7275275 he came to the conclusion very early on that he had to change with the times or that he was doomed to failure
7275276 and he made a very conscious effort to avoid the mistakes that older political bosses in chicago had made
7275277 that coalition has never wavered in their support for richard m daley not once
7275278 and hes added to that the growing support in the black community and the other new communities like the asian community you win elections by addition and he has been very good at that
7275279 theres a lot to be said for the progress of the city its important for tax revenues its important to make the city livable
7275280 how would i sum up their leadership call them great mayors but remember the price the price is corruption

7275285 the kids are doing well compared to their parents and also doing well compared to the native born comparison groups
7275286 what we really find is a very rapid assimilation and becoming american
7275287 in a lot of russian families if you dont have a graduate degree it is frowned upon
7275288 when you get a 96 parents want to know where the other four points went thats the question i think in a lot of immigrant households
7275289 we interviewed one young woman whose mother worked in a garment factory and had very little education
7275290 she said her mother didnt even know what stuyvesant was but she knew from the other moms in the garment factory i need to get my kid into this school
7275291 every time there is a student who maxes out on the sat their picture is prominently placed on the front page in the chinese newspapers
7275292 they give you a pretty good idea of what to expect so even for people whose parents dont speak english they are able to navigate the system
7275293 during the orientation week my sister took me to stuyvesant to ease my mothers fears
7275294 look she knows how to take the subway she knows how to do it on her own she has to go to that school there is no other way
7275295 i will be moving back home because i can save money on the rent and pay for my loans
7275296 there is this ideal in the chinese community when everyone lives together im living at home now
7275297 black americans white americans and puerto ricans seem to share the idea that you must leave home in your teens or early 20s and that there is something wrong with you if you are still living with your parents in your mid 20s
7275298 so we drive to cambridge to visit him or bring him home for the weekend so that he can eat rice with us with his hands and speak bengali things we sometimes worry he will no longer do after we die
7275299 inheriting the city the children of immigrants come of age
7275300 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
7275301 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
7275302 all we have to do is raise credits and look for some religious blogs to help promote we will have to encourage people to add their religious blogs and also encourage entrecarders to donate credits to promote these particular blogs to make everything clear and transparent we will be maintaining the progress reports to tell the world exactly how we are using the credits
7275303 you want my business and you cant have it for free
7275304 you should be so lucky to suck as bad as these guys
7275305 we dont advertise all of our business comes from word of mouth
7275306 people dont go to wendys because its a cool place
7275307 theyll never go to wendys because its a cool place
7275308 what weve found thus far is the younger you are the more likely it is that you dont have a connection with the brand
7275309 the new advertising weve developed really sets the stage and clearly articulates what the brand is about its a reinforcement for anybody thats a bit older but its grounding for people a bit younger that arent as in touch with the brand
7275310 wendys conducted tests in five markets pitting the kirshenbaum bond ads against the red wig ads from saatchi
7275311 what consumers fed back was this new approach was more true to the fundamental principles of the brand
7275312 oh no one is there i suffer so much and i dont know why

7275318 and feelings should come dancing onto the paper untouched when the constraint of rhyme is lifted and the limit of rhythm is abolished the poet does not have to struggle over her word choice and her phrase structure words flow freely just like water into a glass

7275324 door het burgemeestersreferendum op de wijze in te vullen zoals in eindhoven en utrecht zouden de grote regeringspartijen hiermee willen bereiken dat de benoemingsprocedure voor burgemeesters in stand blijft zodat ze hun eigen leiders kunnen blijven aanwijzen
7275325 gemeenten krijgen te veel autonomie de nationale overheid moet het parkeerbeleid weer naar zich toetrekken
7275326 ik ken een winkelier die drie winkels heeft in twee gebieden werd betaald parkeren ingevoerd en zijn omzet daalde daar met vijftien procent in het gebied waar zijn derde winkel stond steeg zijn omzet met tien procent ik snap dat er betaald parkeren is maar de tarieven zijn nu te bizar voor woorden
7275327 alles mag en kan zolang de vvd verkeerswethouder zijn politieke verantwoording maar niet hoeft te nemen
7275328 i believe these drivers would never have started karting unless it had been for the junior club where costs are subsidised
7275329 over the last 35 years i have been passionate about introducing youngsters into karting and the idea of all our new initiatives is to offer young drivers from all backgrounds between the ages of six and 16 the chance to experience the thrill of kart racing at a reasonable cost
7275330 our kart school for instance has trained more than 750 youngsters in the last three years and hopefully our ladder of success will find the next lewis hamilton
7275331 karting has so much to offer to not only motorsport but also to the community
7275332 whether a youngster goes on to drive a formula one car or finds some other place within the motorsport industry or in turn just takes that experience of his first slides or locked up brakes forward to when he or she becomes a motorcycle or car owning driver on our roads it has a part to play
7275333 at buckmore park we have been running pilot schemes with local colleges which have been very successful in showing there is a need for the motorsport training amp technology centre and we hope to reach out into the community and give young people from all backgrounds an opportunity
7275334 it is to be hoped that those that govern our sport will one day appreciate how important grass roots karting is and therefore more emphasis should be placed on the club scene and the encouragement of youngsters to get involved in the first place

7275339 i didnt use many pregnancy tests myself but for three years running i did hope like crazy that i would have reason to need one and then one day long after id all but given up a tiny hieroglyphic materialized in one of those little windows it was like the best ever fortune fluttering from a chinese cookie what i held was no longer a test it was a trophy and its no wonder i still cant toss it out
7275340 month 43 was also the month when you officially dropped your nap for good there is no more napping its like were being forced to give up pain medication and the withdrawal is unbearable some days i still make you take some down time and you and i will go down to our big bed together and lie there quietly for an hour but even that quiet time is becoming a nuisance ill lie there with my eyes closed while you tap my forehead with your index finger a rhythmical indication of the fact that you are not tired and then its can i have some water wheres my pillow wheres chuck why is it dark in here why is daddy upstairs why is the blanket this color why does the fan go so fast why is the window over there until ive had it and im all because heavenly father made it that way now shut up

7275342 instranet gets customers up and running very quickly and we are very big on getting customers up and running quickly rather than putting them through some two year slog
7275343 the acquisition of instranet will throw gasoline on the fire we have got going in a marketplace that is prime for growth
7275344 first ever software as a service company to exceed 1 billion annual revenue run rate
7275345 thinks salesforce may be pushing customers to sign more multi year subscription contracts by lower prices which could be hitting deferred revenue
7275346 by the early 1980s datapoint was a fortune 500 company under immense pressure to increase sales figures its sales representatives encouraged customers to place large orders at the end of the fiscal year permitting the company to count the orders as revenue even though the money had not been received and in some instances the sold equipment had not yet even been produced when some of the customers went broke before paying their bills datapoint had to reverse sales or record substantial bad debts which caused the company to lose 800 million of its market capitalization in a matter of a few months in early 1982 the u s securities and exchange commission sec ordered datapoint to stop this practice

7275354 steve carell just seems to be trying too hard maybe in later episodes when it deviates from gervais and merchants script hell come into his own but right now hes a pale imitation
7275355 producer greg daniels created not a copy but an interpretation that sends up distinctly american work conventions with a tone thats more satiric and less mordant the new boss is different from the old boss and thats fine by me
7275356 thanks to the fearless steve carell an ever stronger supporting cast and scripts that spew american corporate absurdist vernacular with perfect pitch this undervalued remake does the near impossible it honours ricky gervais original and works on its own terms

7275377 residents of baghdad the government imposes collective punishment on us
7275378 in a new development of the methods of the wanton occupation and its agent government the forces called the iraqi army and the police backed by the occupying troops impose collective punishments on the residents of the baghdadi neighborhoods and on the rest of the iraqi areas these punishments include isolating those neighborhoods limiting the movement of citizens after those neighborhoods turned into detention centers this happened through constructing sectarian segregation walls that caused a lot of hardship especially for children elderly people and women who stand in queues under the stifling sun heat noting the presence of many sick people among them the application of this method comes after the targeting of their beasts troops by the national resistance and that is exactly what happened recently in al amiriyah and al saydiyah neighborhoods in baghdad in a way that is similar to what happened before in al fallujah and samaraa
7275379 as we in baghdad residents gathering condemn the application of these inhuman methods by the occupying forces and their agents we call on all international and popular organizations in the arab world to raise their voices to demand a stop to those practices which are considered as a continuation of the massive killing operations that commenced against the iraqi people by the occupation and as an outcome of it
7275380 it chose in coordination with the iraqi military commands a number of areas that are experiencing an escalation of violence in order to protect them from terrorists and not to divide the city baghdad on a sectarian basis
7275381 a number of areas will be subjected to the same method

7275426 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7275427 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7275428 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7275429 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters

7275432 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7275433 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7275434 we dont say that anymore after what they did to us
7275435 did we go to them to fight no they came to us they used to be our neighbors now they are foreigners
7275436 we are neighbors with the georgians but we have no ethnic roots in common
7275437 you had the collapse of an empire and various nationalities scrambling looking for a way to protect themselves

7275440 some bullying and brazen countries and their worthless followers wanted to impose their will on the iranian nation but the president and the government have stood up to their excessive demands and moved forward
7275441 pursuing an aggressive spirit toward world bullies is a manifestation of the governments loyalty to revolutionary slogans and discourse
7275442 we cant be satisfied with the way the country is being administered a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and electricity cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line at gas stations
7275443 we tolerated the executive power in these three years now we can say its over
7275444 khameneis comment is an open support for ahmadinejad his backing of ahmadinejad is also an answer to growing criticism of the government

7275447 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7275448 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7275449 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7275450 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7275451 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7275479 jadi orientasi penelitian yang berjalan adalah uang bukan kebutuhan untuk mengembangkan intelektual dan memajukan masyarakat
7275480 persoalannya bukan ada di sini melainkan pada penyebab mengapa kegiatan penelitian menjadi lesu
7275481 the international situation in recent weeks has seen a increase in tensions which is very worrying
7275482 risk of a deterioration in the climate of trust between nations
7275483 recent events have weakened many peoples confidence that such experiences had been confined definitively to the past
7275484 nationalist confrontations which produced so many tragic consequences in other seasons of history
7275485 the eighth wonder of the world those who understand it profit from those who do not
7275486 the 7 biggest loan mistakes real estate investors make and how to avoid them
7275487 i want to thank all the members of the u s team and jerry colangero national director for the three year program we showed great characters in the tournament maybe the greatest in the international basketball history no other team had the same characters as us because if we dont have them we wont be here at the top of the world
7275488 people said the nba players are selfish arrogant and individual today we showed we can play together
7275489 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7275490 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7275491 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7275492 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7275493 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7275494 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7275495 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7275511 i came in here with high expectations its incredible what a win can do you win once and then you win again and then again ive seen it happen before

7275526 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7275527 mein start war fantastisch wie schon so oft in dieser saison
7275528 ich hatte etwas weniger benzin an bord als lewis und habe in der ersten kurve etwas zu fr h gebremst aber ich blieb dennoch vorne
7275529 ich konnte leicht davonziehen und im zweiten stint haben wir das rennen gewonnen das auto lief perfekt und ich habe meine zeiten st ndig verbessert
7275530 das war von sutil nicht sehr clever weil er mich eh gleich h tte vorbeilassen m ssen
7275531 ich habe etwas zeit verloren aber gl cklicherweise war mein vorsprung gro genug
7275532 um einer eventuellen strafe vorzubeugen haben wir lewis gesagt dass er innerhalb von 10 sekunden dran bleiben soll
7275533 ich bin froh dass wir nach dem desaster von ungarn so zur ckschlagen konnten
7275534 uns allen ist ein gro er stein vom herzen gefallen
7275535 er ist schon in ungarn einzigartig gefahren aber hier hat er diese leistung mit einer brillanz fortgef hrt die man nicht besser machen kann
7275536 ich hatte etwas gesundheitliche probleme und habe das rennen gut berstanden ich war nicht so schnell wie felipe und robert kubica machte in den ersten runden viel druck danach versuchte ich mit felipe mitzuhalten aber es ist schwer zu berholen
7275537 wir haben relativ fr h entschieden dass wir einen sicheren 2 platz mitnehmen wollten
7275538 das war eine clevere entscheidung so haben wir in der fahrer wm 8 punkte mitgenommen und in der konstrukteurswertung aufgeholt
7275539 es waren zwei rennen in spanien und beide male bin ich ausgefallen nakajima war aggressiv aber wenn man so weit hinten startet besteht immer ein risiko wir m ssen weiter vorne starten
7275540 customer surveys have indicated that small to mid size businesses are troubled by the so called
7275541 what do you do for a living thats so good
7275542 the play will be a visual treat for all theatre enthusiasts here with illustrious actors such as mohanlal and mukesh on stage chayamukhi will certainly turn out to be an unforgettable experience for all of us

7275557 o real madrid nunca manter um atleta na equipe contra a sua vontade e n o tem nada mais a fazer a n o ser aceitar uma quebra unilateral do contrato se essa for a vontade do jogador
7275558 o pessoal fez um trabalho incr vel ap s o inc ndio virando a p gina e seguindo em frente se h uma equipe capaz de dar a volta por cima a equipe penske e eles provaram isso
7275559 estamos felizes com cada conquista neste fim de semana largar na primeira fila algo grande para n s vamos continuar trabalhando duro e espero ter um bom resultado
7275560 the fact that these expenditures are not only so large but are undisclosed is extremely troubling
7275561 are trying to influence the elections with millions of dollars that the public cant trace
7275562 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
7275563 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
7275564 if i get punched very rarely have you seen me not hit back hard
7275565 we were searching for the perfect way to provide a needed service which we truly believe in
7275566 some of us feel that our pets are family and wish to provide a beautiful and meaningful farewell for them as well as providing complete closure for ourselves
7275567 our flights operate under the guidelines laid down by both the faa and state of california department of consumer affairs and our records are open to inspection
7275568 we want to thank you for your courteous and compassionate professionalism proceedings were handled with the utmost dignity and the spectacular site you selected for us exceeded what we expected
7275569 the opening track hes simple hes dumb hes the pilot absolutely blew my mind when i first heard it
7275570 this years festival brings art back to its ancient ecological roots so that we can re connect with our environment on several levels we can embrace its role a wonderful natural muse but we can also start to look upon the earth as something that we should preserve and protect for future generations of artists and makers
7275571 many girls feel more comfortable around dogs than they do around horses
7275572 the animal is going to mirror the emotions the girls are expressing
7275573 the benefit is that there is this exchange going on between the girls and the dogs
7275574 the bottom line is that animals are always in the present
7275575 when the girls work with them it can be magical
7275576 this shows that titan pokers jackpot tournaments are very popular and are continuing to grow at a fast rate
7275577 by placing more pressure on your feet as you stand or walk the joints and ligaments have to work harder to maintain foot structure and the more pressure your feet have to accommodate the more your feet will splay or stretch out when you bear weight overtime your feet will stop bouncing back and they will eventually just stay wider
7275578 we see peoples misery every day of the week and its not just those with weight problems our shop staff and our 24 7 helpline are helping more and more customers who are in so much discomfort they just dont know what to do
7275579 so many people especially women fail to wear the right shoes they will flog their feet to death in ill fitting footwear because they wrongly believe they cant buy the right style and fashions at the right price in wider larger foot sizes
7275580 more and more brides are spending their big day in pain on what should be the happiest day of their lives
7275581 wearing the wrong shoes can cause a host of problems including bunions corns hammer toes and even tumours the population at large is growing but most shoes are still made to fit a size that is increasingly no longer average
7275582 since our population is living longer people are developing higher expectations for a better quality of life in their senior years
7275583 its vital that we teach people how to keep their bodies and minds working at their full capacity
7275584 the medical community once thought that while the body benefited from good health choices very little could be done to help regenerate the brain we now know that the brain is very resilient and it is possible to keep the brain sharp and agile as one grows older

7275586 die informationen die wir im moment zusammentragen ist so erstaunlich dass wir in der tat sehr erschrocken sind von dem was wir dort unten gefunden haben
7275587 eine weitere berraschung sind die hohen temperaturen die wir dort n he des zentrums der erde gemessen haben unsere berechnungen deuten darauf hin dass es etwa ungef hr 1 100 c sein m ssten
7275588 das ist viel mehr als wir urspr nglich angenommen haben das kann nur hei en dass es dort unten ein wahres feuerinferno geben muss
7275589 schlie lich sollten wir das grauen schlechthin noch h ren etwas was unsere wissenschaftler so verschreckte dass sie tats chlich angst haben das projekt weiterzuf hren
7275590 wir versuchten die bewegungen der erde in bestimmten intervallen durch supersensitive mikrofone die wir dort herunter lie en aufzuzeichnen was wir allerdings h rten lies aber selbst den logisch denkensten wissenschaftler erzittern
7275591 nachdem wir die einstellung und justierung der anlage noch einmal berpr ften waren wir uns sicher dass das was wir h rten tats chlich aus dem erdinneren kam wie konnten unseren ohren kaum glauben wir h rten tats chlich menschliche stimmen die in unter gr ter pein und schmerz schrien obwohl dass klar eine stimme im vordergrund erkennbar war mussten es noch tausende vielleicht millionen anderer seelen gewesen sein die dort unten noch immer schreien
7275592 was ins wirklich in panik versetzte war eine weitere erscheinung in der nacht nachdem pl tzlich gas aus dem loch hervorscho und die ganze forschungsstation zu vernebeln beging trat daraus ein geisterhaftes wesen mit fledermausfl geln hervor dass uns in russisch ich habe erorbert entgegen rief bevor es in den sibirischen nachthimmel aufstieg
7275593 das erlebnis war so unecht die sovjets schrien pl tzlich auf
7275594 als kommunist glaube ich nicht an den himmel aber als wissenschaftler glaube ich jetzt an die h lle
7275595 ich brauche wohl nicht weiter erw hnen dass wir wirklich sehr geschockt waren aber wir wu ten das was wir gesehen und geh rt hatten war echt wir sind davon berzeugt wirklich ein loch in die h lle gebohrt zu haben der bohrkopf drehte sich wirklich sehr schnell so dass da wir annehmen m ssen wirklich in einen hohlraum vorgesto en zu sein die temperaturen schossen auf ber 1 100 grad hoch und statt plattenbewegungen h rten wir diese schreie
7275596 ich glaube nicht an gott und nicht an den himmel aber jetzt glaube ich an die h lle wir sind davon berzeugt dass wir die decke der h lle durchbohrt haben wir h rten menschen die vor schmerz heulten die stimmen von millionen

7275600 mobilize to their duty stations 8 a m sunday and monitor canals and levees in the city
7275601 however we are prepared to close the gates and run the pumps should the need arise
7275602 the storm is actually weakening thats not to say were not going to have rain
7275603 were still expecting some flooding because of this weve got everything on standby hopefully it wont come to that
7275604 you cant look at the u s olympic team and not see the strength that comes from diversity and you cant look at the chinese team and not see the strength that comes from intense focus and concentrated power lets start with us walking through the olympic village the other day heres what struck me most the russian team all looks russian the african team all looks african the chinese team all looks chinese and the american team looks like all of them
7275605 yo lo dudo porque hay un reglamento me imagino que las reglas se van a seguir
7275606 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7275607 so tell me what did you learn from the trip
7275608 i saw that we have one dog and they had four we have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end we have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon we have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight we have servants who serve us but they serve others we buy our food but they grow theirs we have walls around our property to protect us they have friends to protect them
7275609 cela a permis des pays de taille modeste davoir voix au chapitre de venir sur la sc ne internationale
7275610 ich habe einen guten start erwischt und der wagen lief gut
7275611 es war nicht einfach hier zu berholen und man muss viel geduld haben eine taktik die sich auszuzahlen schien als andy soucek anm d red pl tzlich langsamer geworden ist musste ich au en auf den kurbs vorbeirutschen um ihn nicht zu erwischen ich kam wieder auf die strecke zur ck und habe nichts besch digt
7275612 es ist m glich dass ich auf meinen reifen ein bisschen dreck aufgesammelt habe weil mir drei kurven sp ter der wagen entglitt ich bin eh schon in diesem streckenabschnitt ziemlich ins rutschen geraten diesmal war es zuviel es war eben einer dieser tage wo man besser im bett bleibt dieses wochenende l sst uns mit einem haufen arbeit zur ck aber ich wei dass wir in spa und monza sehr konkurrenzf hig sein werden es sind noch vier rennen zu fahren und die meisterschaft ist noch immer in reichweite
7275613 am ende bin ich von startplatz 14 sogar noch dritter geworden das ist gut nach allem was gestern passiert ist es gab nichts was wir noch h tten tun k nnen nat rlich tun die gestrigen geschehnisse noch weh daher bin ich sehr gl cklich heute auf platz drei heimgekommen zu sein besonders da senna heute keine punkte geholt hat
7275614 the police elections commissioner and all monitors have admitted the pre poll violence was unprecedented
7275615 this result was a deliberate loss for the current jvp leadership
7275616 its not that biden cant be a team player but he is not the sort to stick to a script from time to time his lively spirit and fits of temper have led him astray especially in moments of stress
7275617 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7275618 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7275619 i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7275620 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules
7275621 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7275622 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7275623 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7275624 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7275625 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7275626 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7275627 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7275628 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7275629 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7275630 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7275631 the radiance of science and technology lights up the love

7275634 nbc will not be showing the ceremony until tonight and americans who are unable to pick up canadian or mexican telecasts will not see any of it until roughly 12 hours after it happens
7275635 let us remember all those poor people who lost their humble homes years ago in preparation for these efficient games who have yet to be compensated
7275636 what s with the snarky snide tone of this live blog

7275646 the most important thing an art adviser can provide is access
7275647 ive definitely felt that theres a certain hazing ritual in art buying galleries literally want your c v and that of your client
7275648 the client purchased the work for less than 50 000

7275653 my uncle terry died earlier this year and hes always told me to believe in myself i want to dedicate this to him and i felt that he was with me during the playoff
7275654 it feels pretty good i couldnt get too far ahead of myself i was saying in the morning that if nothing goes well early in the day you cant give up i just hung in there and started to feel more confident coming down the stretch which was surprising
7275655 ive been hitting into bunkers all week and i finally found one that was sitting up perfectly it was the easiest shot i just had to splash it out and hope for the best ive never been that excited
7275656 this win takes the pressure off as i can pick and choose my events its a huge weight off my career as i was well down the order of merit
7275657 i hit a good bunker shot in the play off but didnt have the luck rick had the luck with him
7275658 i felt i had a chance to win on the back nine after i made birdies on the 15th and 17th holes and i was playing well coming in the winds were quite swirly today and my approach in the play off just carried into the bunker
7275659 im very happy i had to save pars on 16 and 17 the winds kept changing and i couldnt get my clubbing right i didnt know i was tied for the lead but i just kept to my routine i wanted to win badly but it wasnt to be i played good this week and hopefully i can have another chance to win
7275660 with the way the scores were going i didnt think i was that close to the lead when i was 12 under par i found out on the 14th hole that i was tied for the lead and tried to play solid coming down the stretch but it wasnt to be

7275662 the crimes for which the accused is paying the penalty today demonstrate that the gesture extended to them was not justified and that it led to the killing of additional innocent citizens the danger posed by the accused was clear after he had already been convicted of murder in the past the need to keep them at a distance from human civilization forever was also self evident after his release the accused demonstrated that the gesture was unjustified and the steep price for this was paid by many israeli families

7275666 self pity is easily the most destructive of the non pharmaceutical narcotics it is addictive gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality
7275667 worrying about things that dont even matter in the long run you allow yourself to be overcome and others to walk over you in whatever way they wish
7275668 self pity is an extreme form of egocentrism and usually a result of a very selfish perspective of the world people who regularly engage in self pity are miserable and they tend to make others quite unhappy too
7275669 i believe self pity to be the single most addictive thing in the world partly because no one will admit to having it in the first place

7275673 i had put 60 000 into that car and these guys only had it for 15 minutes and they wrote it off it makes you wonder how many other cars they have taken out for joy rides
7275674 whenever a nice car came in they were all itching to take it for a drive
7275675 i saw them do burn outs speed and drive erratically on test drives and their attitude was its not my car
7275676 they have just told me a lot of lies at first it had been side swiped then they had swerved to miss a car and finally they said they had tried to dodge a runaway dog

7275705 this is a new role for me i get to watch another guy play
7275706 he does have really good accuracy and he fits well into the scheme of things
7275707 nobody is going to hand you an opportunity to play
7275708 youre going to have to claw and scratch just to stay in the league
7275709 there is not a sense of relief by any means
7275710 youre excited about the season about the opportunity to go into a season were getting ready for san diego this week and arizona to start the season
7275711 you have to use it as motivation and continue to push yourself and get better
7275712 prove to people prove to myself that i can play well in this league
7275713 i came to work prepared i felt like i put a lot into this studied more than ive ever studied
7275714 its too far down the line when that time comes i will deal with it i am focused on the here and now
7275715 we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be
7275716 it was good to see him with the ball in his hands
7275717 when im in the zone i feel like i cant be stopped
7275718 so to get out there and get some opportunities catching the ball going into the regular season feels good
7275719 we admitted that we were powerless and our lives were unmanageable
7275720 we came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity
7275721 we made a decision to turn our lives and our wills over to the care of god as we understood god
7275722 hes putting out his message of change of the future versus the past the eyes are going to be on obama whos less well known
7275723 the realization of what he had been asked to do hit me like a punch to the gut
7275724 it was an honour for him he told me that although he didnt know the soldier he had delivered the news of his passing to the soldiers family and felt as if he knew them after many conversations in so few days
7275725 so heres a public thank you to our military men and women for what you do so we can live the way we do
7275726 someone has come up with a very powerful narrative thats very affecting thats plausible to support the cause
7275727 through our research this story has been circulating for years and is coming from an unknown source
7275728 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7275729 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7275730 what happened in the last few days that justifies calling a general election
7275731 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgement there were a number of people that took offence to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7275732 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7275733 i m really into fashion and love to wear the latest trends but all my friends just wear jeans and a t shirt
7275734 for four plays before long it became apparent that the raiders passing attack is far from ready for prime time in the season opener sept 8 against the denver broncos on national tv
7275735 you saw what would have happened last year and what would happen this year if we tried to be one dimensional
7275736 we have to go back to the same way we were before
7275737 it was sort of like i could see us doing it all game everything was on rhythm at the time
7275738 wed like to see people being required to work if they are in jail there are too many ways right now for people to avoid that
7275739 were not looking at this in a punitive way we want to see people if theyre going to be in jail for a number of years lets get them in a training program an apprentice program maybe work towards a journeymans certificate some type of occupational standard that when they finally are released from prison they have some way of taking care of themselves rather than doing that illegally
7275740 we are prepared for this and we are expecting a formal announcement at the teleconference
7275741 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
7275742 when you think about dinner tonight would you smile or laugh
7275743 this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7275744 this is the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
7275745 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7275746 if test results went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focussing on so it is good news

7275761 what did you do that for that was an expensive bottle of wine
7275762 give you a walk through of the presidents day what he did when he learned various pieces of information
7275763 myers when it became clear what the threat was we did scramble fighter aircraft that order to the best of my knowledge was after the pentagon was struck
7275764 oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
7275765 bushs presence made the planned reading event a perceived target
7275766 the well publicized event at the school assured bushs location that day was no secret
7275767 for some reason secret service agents did not bustle bush away
7275768 the procedure should have been to get the president to the closest secure location as quickly as possible
7275769 one of the many unanswered questions about that day is why the secret service did not immediately hustle bush to a secure location as it apparently did with vice president dick cheney
7275770 i dont understand how one sits there i just dont minutes are an eternity in that sort of situation a quick presidential decision may save lives
7275771 the president told us his instinct was to project calm not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis the president felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening
7275772 it speaks volumes about the preoccupation these politicians have about manipulating image
7275773 the way to project calm and strength is to take care of business
7275774 i dont understand how one sits there i just dont minutes are an eternity in that sort of situation a quick presidential decision may save lives
7275775 character is not defined in good times when youve been properly briefed its defined when youre in a desperate crisis situation
7275776 its made a little more complex by being in the presence of little kids
7275777 it certainly wouldnt present the right message if he turned white rushed out and kids started crying
7275778 they had declared war on us and i made up my mind at that moment that we were going to war
7275779 as far as we know no one was in contact with the pentagon the focus was on the presidents statement to the nation no decisions were made at this time other than the decision to return to washington
7275780 a quiet evening and a night of sleep were the best preparation
7275781 jackie is at his side and shes giving legitimacy to his presidency
7275782 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government

7275787 over the course of the next few minutes the vehicle is seen a number of times in the neighbourhood by a number of police members and there are some attempts made to stop the vehicle
7275788 all this is subject to investigation but we know that our police member discharged a firearm at the driver of the vehicle the vehicle carried on for a short distance about a block and a 34 year old male was taken into custody and then immediately taken to hospital by ems for treatment of serious injuries
7275789 its an injury sustained in this incident but not firearm involved he wasnt shot

7275831 bob said to me that hes going to put everything that hes done coaching me and just throw it out the door and do something completely different just to see how it works
7275832 if its successful then great if not we can go back to what weve been doing
7275833 weve all had some races here and there and they britain have improved so much over the last four years and im just looking forward to seeing how much faster they can go

7275839 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7275840 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7275841 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7275842 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7275843 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see
7275844 there is one narrative that is the accepted narrative if you are on board with that narrative you can fully enjoy the games you can get excited by the chinese gold medals you can be part of this national project
7275845 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face

7275946 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7275947 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7275948 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7275949 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7275950 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7275951 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
7275952 tacit understandings of health literacy interview and survey research with health journalists
7275953 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7275954 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7275955 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7275956 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7275957 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7275958 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7275959 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7275960 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7275961 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
7275962 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7275963 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7275964 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7275965 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7275966 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7275967 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7275973 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon

7275987 its not unknown to them they know that the apostles founded the church of rome just like historians do
7275988 in acts 2 10 luke lists among the jews and proselytes gathered in jerusalem for the feast of the assembly or pentecost see the note on 15 24 roman sojourners does not mean residents of jerusalem they were rather pilgrim sojourners acts 6 9 also knows of a synagogue of the freedmen liberti jewish slaves who had managed to gain their freedom in the roman world see sanday and headlam romans xxviii these freedmen could actually have come from anywhere in the roman empire but many of them might well have been descendants of jerusalem jews taken to rome by pompey as prisoners of war in 63 bc who came to form a great part of the jewish population there
7275989 if some of the roman sojourners in jerusalem were among the three thousand jews converted to christianity according to the lucan account acts 2 10 11 41 they may have formed the nucleus of the christian community in rome on their return there thus the roman christian community would have had its matrix in the jewish community possibility as early as the 30s and thus was made up at first of jewish christians and god fearing gentiles or even of proselytoi acts 2 11 also mentioned in roman jewish funerary inscriptions who had associated themselves with jews of rome
7275990 the letter to the romans itself is actually the earliest document that attests the existence of the roman christian community which paul knows to have been in existence for for many years 15 23
7275991 much later eusebius tells of peter arriving in rome on the heels of simon magus to preach the gospel there in the second year of claudius the catalogus liberianus dating from ad 354 also speaks of peter as the founder of the roman church having exercised an episcopate of twenty five years this is undoubtedly part of a later legendary tradition tha sought to explain where peter went when he departed jerusalem for another place acts 12 17 eusebiuss notice encounters the difficulty that paul in gal 2 7 9 written ca 54 knows that peter was still in jerusalem for the so called council dated ca 49 and had apparently not yet left the eastern mediterranean area similarly acts 15 6 7
7275992 a more reliable tradition associated with paul with peter as founders of the roman community not in the sense that they first brought christian faith there but because both of them eventually worked there and suffered martyrdom there or in its immediate environs and because their mortal remains were in the possession of the roman church see ignatius rom 4 3 irenaeus adversus haereses 3 1 1 3 3 2 sc 2 11 22 23 32 33
7275993 in any case paul never hints in romans that he knows that peter has worked in rome or founded the christian church there before his planned visit cf 15 20 23 if he refers indirectly to peter as among the superfine apostles who worked in corinth 2 cor 11 4 5 he says nothing like that about rome in his letter hence the beginnings of the roman christian community remain shrouded in mystery compare 1 thess 3 2 5 1 cor 3 5 9 and col 1 7 and 4 12 13 for more or less clear references to founding apostles of other locales hence there is no reason to think that peter spent any major portion of time in rome before paul wrote his letter or that he was the founder of the roman church or the missionary who first brought christianity to rome for it seems highly unlikely that luke if he knew that peter had gone to rome and evangelized that city would have omitted all mention of it in acts
7275994 most likely the christian community in rome began not under any direct evangelization of the area as it did in parts of the eastern mediterranean but through the presence of jewish christians and gentiles associated with them who came to live there and went about ordinary tasks and secular duties slaves brought to rome merchants who came from other parts of the empire and other individuals probably carried the christian gospel there neither the letter to the romans nor the acts of the apostles alludes to any initial evangelization of rome by a particular missionary but paul does send greetings to andronicus and junia whom he recognizes as my fellow countrymen and outstanding among the apostles 16 7 and who may have been among such jewish christians who originally came from jerusalem the community undoubtedly also grew by the gradual immigration of christians themselves who traveled to the capital during the 40s via the jewish diaspora
7275995 suetonius then would have been referring to a conflict between jews and jewish christians of rome in the late 40s the constant disturbances would apparently have been caused by jews who opposed those who accepted jesus as the messiah or lord and who consequently differed in their interpretation of the law and threatened thereby ethnic unity and identity

7276017 but if youre like me and youve got one house
7276018 or youre like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

7276311 37 do not believe me unless i do what my father does 38 but if i do it even though you do not believe me believe the miracles that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i in the father

7276322 because jesus himself has suffered and been emptied he is able to help those who are tempted he can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is beset with weakness

7276324 giving thanks unto the father who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
7276325 how is god going to bless me in the middle of all this
7276326 delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
7276327 i am blessed because the relationship with my abusive father has been healed and restored but whenever i have an opportunity to pray for him and myself i do to let the lord point out anything that may be hiding firday night while praying i kept seeing one beating over and over in my head i thought it was the enemy trying to bring up unforgiveness but soon i realized it was not bringing those feelings with it so i asked god what it was he showed me that i was feeling shame because i was being beaten for telling a lie and my dad was trying to beat the truth out of me i was too consumed in fear to speak then my mom stepped between us and yelled stop i saw the grace in her eyes and could hear the desperation in her voice i felt guilty god pointed out to me that that was the moment my spirit was broken that guilt shame and fear consumed me i put down my bible and picked up drugs and alcohol and went deep into a rebellious lifestyle for the next 10 years what god showed me was i never forgave myself for that decision on that day i got a healing on that friday night i was able to step into a deeper healing and went into a deep love of god the father
7276328 during the night of the session of the fathers heart god did a deeper work in my heart when i heard about the different types of earthly fathers my father hit on 5 of the 6 father types in my life i had received prayer in the past and i received breakthrough to experience the fathers embrace and love but still my heart was cut off because all i could see was my troubled past and painful relationship with my earthly father this night would be different and my heavenly father broke through my heart during the prayers of repentance and release my heart was being broken and tenderized and i experienced a release that was like water being flushed down a toilet i had an enormous peace and my papas love filled the vacant places of my heart and soul that night the father continued to just love me and reaffirm that he would always be with me forever and i was not an orphan but his daughter the next day as i was driving in my car papa met me in that time when it was only he and i and he began to show me pictures of my past with my earthly father although there had been a past of hard physical discipline fear and rejection there were times when he showed his affection for me i forgot about those time they were locked behind the fear and pain my papa whowed me the times when dad would always volunteer to comb my hair before bedtime playing pool games racing me around the house playing frisbee and most of all calling me his little girl my heart was again encountered there in the car and papa was still backfilling but this time with truth yes there was pain and fear in my past but now i was able to see that my father did love me but he just had issues of brokenness in his own life that disabled him from showing me as much as i needed i no longer grieve for myself but i now grieve for my earthly father for he too needs to have his heart mended and needs papa to come rescue him i was now able to see my earthly father through the eyes of jesus and his love for my earthly dad hes redeeming the time in this season of my life getting relationships in order and giving the fullness of his grace as a gift in the process
7276329 weve had illness hit us the past couple of months this was such a wonderful refreshing time together in the presence of god weve had fun again personally it was wonderful to realize that gods grace has enabled me to be a good father to my sons and to realize that the work he is doing in me has affected my sons this was very encouraging to me
7276330 god took a big load out of my life for my children and myself i was really blessed life changing experience such peace is in my heart god is my daddy
7276331 keep my message in plain view at all times concentrate learn it by heart those who discover these words live really live body soul theyre bursting with health
7276332 the spirit of god the master is on me because god anointed me he sent me to preach good news to the poor heal the heartbroken announce freedom to all captives pardon all prisoners to comfort all who mourn
7276333 dont begin by traveling to some far off place to convert unbelievers and dont try to be dramatic by tackling some public enemy go to the lost confused people right here in the neighborhood tell them that the kingdom is here bring health to the sick raise the dead touch the untouchables kick out the demons you have been treated generously so live generously dont think you have to put on a fund raising campaign before you start you dont need a lot of equipment you are the equipment and all you need to keep that going is three meals a day travel light this is hazardous work im assigning you youre going to be like sheep running through a world pack so dont call attention to yourselves dont be naive dont hesitate to go public now
7276334 i wonder what type of car jesus would pull into our parking lot with
7276335 what would jesus think of our conversations before and after church
7276336 you dont build up the weak ones dont heal the sick dont doctor the injured dont go after the strays dont look for the lost
7276337 i myself will be the shephered of my sheep i myself will make sure they get plenty of rest ill go after the lost ill collect the strays ill doctor the injured ill build up the weak ones and oversee the strong ones so theyre not exploited
7276338 get that kid out of here now no children are allowed
7276339 he is not leaving until he sings to his sister
7276340 you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray
7276341 you never know dear how much i love you please dont take my sunshine away
7276342 the other night dear as i lay sleeping i dreamed i held you in my arms
7276343 you are my sunshine my only sunshine please dont take my sunshine away
7276344 our spiritual communities are as susceptible to disease as our physical bodies but it is easier to detect whatever is wrong in our stomachs and lungs than in our worship and witness when our physical bodies are sick or damaged the pain calls our attention to it and we do something quick but a dangerous even deadly virus in our spiritual communities can go undetected for a long time as much as we need physicians for our bodies we have even greater need for diagnosticians and healers of the spirit
7276345 you dont build up the weak ones dont doctor the injured dont go after the strays dont look for the lost and now theyre scattered every which way no one out looking for them i myself am the shepherd im going looking for them ill go after the lost ill collect the strays
7276346 the spirit of god the master is on me because god anointed me he sent me to preach good news to the poor
7276347 god authorized and commanded me to commission you go out and comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them success tip
7276348 its all about jesus not about you or any of your concerns its all about jesus
7276349 woe to them to act without consulting the lord and knowing what his purpose is
7276350 i wanted to share this testimony with you from the sipw of march 28 29th
7276351 my husband and i are soaking at home now i purchased utopia by theresa griffith hurlbert someone told me about her at the conference this one has flutes a harp and piano and is awesome
7276352 my daughter called me a few days after the weekend and said she had a miracle she woke up shes at college and she told me it was about a 5 hour awakening where
7276353 during the performance orientation soaking session god told me that my brother g who is down syndrome was
7276354 there is nothing he could do to perfect himself and yet look how much your family loved and accepted him
7276355 not so little one how can you change the structure of the universe its in my hands and in that i ask you to trust i love you and need you but i dont need your doing i need and want your heart be assured of this in you i am well pleased whether you lie down stand up fight or sleep you are mine and i am yours lets love and laugh together for i enjoy your company in this alone trust
7276356 one thing the soaking prayer weekend helped me to realize was my need for practicing his presence and taking this time in my life to rest in him and learn who i am and learn to hear his voice
7276357 while i was soaking i saw myself as a little girl and i was on the beach with jesus and i began ot make a sand castle and jesus said no its not big enough
7276358 when i was younger i had a vision of jesus and me riding 4 wheelers together in heaven
7276359 it was very good learning how to be quiet before the lord as simple as it is
7276360 god revealed things in my life that i have been dealing with and showed me some things that i need to do pertaining to what has been going on
7276361 it was a miracles how my sister and i even made it here for this training
7276362 god spoke to me during the contemplative prayer time about an injury i have had for almost 40 years that this weekend was a time of the lord reaffirming things in my life i am divorced and struggling financially
7276363 my daughter and i were thinking of coming here and i said lord if you want us to attend then give us a sign
7276364 i wasnt very sure if we should come here so i asked god if i should go and if i should stop the rain and he did for like half a second and so i was like okay so i asked again and lightning went around our car so i really believe that i should be here i also finally found out that god speaks to you in different ways he speaks to me in drawings and visions also i heard me laughing as a little kid
7276365 interesting i was blessed to sit by chris and bryden who are anointed to draw by the holy spirits direction they encouraged me to allow holy spirit to right brain create through me my cup has been turned right side up im not sure of course just what all that means i do know that as i soaked this weekend wisdom of situations and relationships just dropped into me i have such an increase in understanding concerning the dynamics of soaking thank you
7276366 i have always wondered about how difficult it seemed to set aside time for god i mean time with god not in services and ministry but time with him ive soaked before but this weekend with guidance and some structure i found it easy to hear gods voice he asked me to spend more time with him and he would show me his creativity
7276367 one amazing thing god showed me is when jesus was on the cross he desperately loved those who hated him with utmost intensity
7276368 as i was soaking i saw jesus running toward me in a field of flowers
7276369 a few months ago i attended a healing hearts conference and i was healed of a lot of hurts forgiveness and forgiving of hurts
7276370 here is what i the lord intended for that story to accomplish now watch it and understand my strategies to end abortion
7276371 what if this story is a secret that is about to become a bomb
7276372 i have a dream let the unborn go free let them be conceived in liberty and let them be adopted in infancy

7276377 weve got to make noise in greater amounts so open your mouth lad for every voice counts
7276378 do you see what i mean theyve proved they are persons no matter how small i believe the crux of the abortion issue is the deception from satan that says the unborn are not people at all and their whole world was saved by the smallest of all
7276379 and from now on you know what im planning to do from now on im going to protect them with you
7276380 me too from sun in the summer from rain when its fall ish im going to protect them no matter how small ish
7276381 maam i had a dream last night i dreamt of
7276382 my ten year old daughter was reading horton hears a who to her little brother
7276383 a persons a person no matter how small the whos are the unborn
7276384 it is time for all the whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of their country he said
7276385 jesus i plead your blood over my sins and the sins of my nation god end abortion and send revival to america
7276386 and from now on you know what i am planning to do from now on i am going to protect them with you
7276387 do we have an obligation to defend the united states and her allies
7276388 lets talk about rights for christians and jews in saudi arabia lets talk about rights for women in saudi arabia
7276389 you know weve decided that were very uncomfortable with you being here and you should leave
7276390 ive got to check out two weeks early because the warlord has told me that he no longer will protect me
7276391 well why are you listening to him hes not the government there is no government
7276392 the iranians are waging a proxy war against americans in iraq
7276393 on monday chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said the problem of the content of the document setting out joint principles for peace making post annapolis has not been resolved
7276394 terrific lets go visit mecca since clearly theres no other state except israel that is based on religion the fact that i happen to be christian wont bother anybody
7276395 im really for strength as long as i can have peace but id really like to have peace except i dont want to recognize these people who arent very peaceful
7276396 oh gosh i think ill have an existential crisis of identity in which i will try to think through whether or not we can be friends while youre killing me
7276397 we hate the west we hate freedom we will kill them all
7276398 well if the enemy wins you wont be allowed to be on television
7276399 look you want to kill young americans youre going to walk to the battlefield youre not going to ride in the car because youre not going to have any gasoline
7276400 the one who practices sin is of the devil for the devil has sinned from the beginning the son of god appeared for this purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil
7276401 for what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated you endure it with patience but if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it this finds favour with god for you have been called for this purpose since christ also suffered for you leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps
7276402 before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i have appointed you a prophet to the nations
7276403 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered matt 10 30
7276404 for there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are
7276405 and since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us
7276406 for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
7276407 i therefore the prisoner of the lord entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called
7276408 to this end also we pray for you always that our god may count you worthy of your calling and fulfil every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power in order that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
7276409 therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our lord or of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was granted us in christ jesus from all eternity
7276410 therefore brethren be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choosing you for as long as you practice these things you will never stumble
7276411 o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will give thanks to thy name for thou hast worked wonders plans formed long ago with perfect faithfulness
7276412 for thus says the lord when seventy years have been completed for babylon i will visit you and fulfil my good word to you to bring you back to this
7276413 since his days are determined the number of his months is with thee and his limits thou hast set so that he cannot pass
7276414 for we shall surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again yet god does not take away life but plans ways so that the banished one may not be cast out from him
7276415 the lord nullifies the counsel of the nations he frustrates the plans of the peoples
7276416 commit your works to the lord and your plans will be established
7276417 i know that thou canst do all things and that no purpose of thine can be thwarted
7276418 for david after he had served the purpose of god in his
7276419 also we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to his purpose who works to do his task his unusual task and to work his work his extraordinary work
7276420 so it is you that has been calling everyday for the past week
7276421 god youre our provider i am tempted to worry and complain
7276422 wie gaat er nou slooppanden van binnen fotograferen en wie zit daar op te wachten
7276423 ladies and gentlemen if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after youve put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentleman thats not a worry john mccain will have to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7276424 saddle up your horse and get ready to ride it will be the ride of your life
7276425 how do you prepare before you show up at a conference
7276426 well how far is south bend where is south bend
7276427 yes thats interesting are we talking about the sound system
7276428 calling forth the things that be not as though they were
7276429 lord we want to hear the angelic sound and we want there to be a release of light and we want there to be a release of creation and we want there to be a release of whats without form whats in our heart destiny is in our heart lord
7276430 god let there be a release in whats without form
7276431 god i access the promises of god i have been waiting for that vision that dream that prophetic promise for 20 years
7276432 i will pour out such blessing there will not be room enough to receive it
7276433 and so lord release that over us tonight release a realm of apostolic building dreams visions release a creative realm dreaming with god big god big stuff lord release a real realm and weve come to receive that
7276434 if youre willing and obedient you shall eat the fruit of the land
7276435 so lord release light sound and creation i dont know how its going to manifest over the next few days but were going to see it manifest right here in these meetings
7276436 how does it happen that in the eyes of workers of publicists and of statesmen abundance seems dangerous and scarcity advantageous i propose to trace this illusion to its source
7276437 whereas to consider as fundamental solely the immediate self interest of the consumer is to take the general interest as the foundation of social policy
7276438 once big brown won the second leg of the triple crown we knew all eyes would be on belmont we are honored that anthony was asked to sing on such a special occasion and we hope big brown will win the triple crown
7276439 if you start to put together a combined team for the olympic games the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team if this is the case then why the hell do they have four associations and four votes and their own vice presidency this will put into question all the privileges that the british associations were given by the congress in 1946
7276440 we dont want anything to do with a british team and made that clear from very early on
7276441 i have met gordon brown but our position remains the same a team uk would raise questions in terms of our future as an autonomous footballing nation
7276442 right now we have our own association league and national team and that is not something we are willing to compromise
7276443 i dont see a change of heart on this theres no backing for this from our administration or our supporters
7276444 when is gordon brown going to realise that nobody wants a team uk a position that could threaten our own independent national side
7276445 to be honest nobody up here takes anything that brown says seriously anymore
7276446 he has proven time and time again that he is more interested in being english than scottish he even admitted to supporting the england team
7276447 scotland is focussed on trying to qualify for world cups and european championships
7276448 in my opinion it would be axiomatic that such a temporary merger could lead to the eventual permanent combination of england scotland northern ireland and wales into a single footballing entity in future major tournaments such as the world cup and european championships
7276449 the fsf is opposed to a single uk team in the olympics we believe that such a team would be an entirely artificial entity given the existence of separate teams from each of the 4 countries in the uk in all other forms of international football which is a tradition of very long standing which fans from the 4 countries wish to retain we share the fears of fans from the other uk countries that this precedent might be used to challenge the separate existence of those teams in the future notwithstanding the assurances given by fifa that this will not happen
7276450 the amalgamation of official niscs is opposed to the concept of a united kingdom representative team participating in the 2012 olympic football tournament we feel that such a move would undoubtedly lead to increased lobbying for an end to the present individual representative status of the four british associations a scenario which international fans throughout the home nations would be opposed to
7276451 the olympic side has our best wishes but it could mean the death of a countrys football team and the welsh should not have to pay that price
7276452 they should enter only a team composed of players from england

7276635 bravo reaches baghdad where the men are shocked by the sheer size and scope of the city they set up shop in an abandoned cigarette factory and get a chance to rest for a bit although the factory grounds arent quite as secure as theyd like hampered by having only one translator for the battalion first recon can only send out sporadic patrols into the city during those patrols they discover the list of problems the iraqis face is much greater than the marines could imagine their attempts to help are thwarted by ever changing assignments a lack of necessary supplies unruly locals and cultural misunderstandings while colbert worries about his friend kocher who has been demoted fick becomes more and more disillusioned with the lack of a plan in baghdad and refuses an order that would put his men in danger the men learn their final night in baghdad is upon them and celebrate in a soccer stadium they head south to an abandoned iraqi army base to wrap things up but not before ferrandos misguided enthusiasm has disastrous results the marines take inventory and reflect on their time in iraq and tensions that have been simmering throughout finally boil over during a friendly football game scribe says his goodbyes to the men and has an interesting conversation with ferrando before heading off one of the recon marines shows the movie hes put together from footage hes shot the men enjoy the sights and sounds before drifting off tvma ac al 67 minutes

7276660 well tom it sure sounds like youre busy with your job im sure they pay you well but its a shame you have to be away from home and your family so much hard to believe a young fellow should have to work sixty or seventy hours a week to make ends meet too bad you missed your daughters dance recital
7276661 let me tell you something tom something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities
7276662 you see i sat down one day and did a little arithmetic the average person lives about seventy five years i know some live more and some live less but on average folks live about seventy five years
7276663 now then i multiplied 75 times 52 and i came up with 3900 which is the number of saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime now stick with me tom im getting to the important part
7276664 it took me until i was fifty five years old to think about all this in any detail
7276665 and by that time i had lived through over twenty eight hundred saturdays i got to thinking that if i lived to be seventy five i only had about a thousand of them left to enjoy
7276666 so i went to a toy store and bought every single marble they had i ended up having to visit three toy stores to round up 1000 marbles i took them home and put them inside of a large clear plastic container right here in my workshop next to the radio every saturday since then i have taken one marble out and thrown it away
7276667 i found that by watching the marbles diminish i focused more on the really important things in life there is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight
7276668 now let me tell you one last thing before i sign off with you and take my lovely wife out for breakfast this morning i took the very last marble out
7276669 it was nice to talk to you tom i hope you spend more time with your loved ones and i hope to meet you again someday have a good morning
7276670 cmon honey im taking you and the kids to breakfast
7276671 it has just been a long time since we spent a saturday together with the kids
7276672 hey can we stop at a toy store while were out i need to buy some marbles

7276758 information taken from man and his gold published by the gold information center
7276759 why gold is unique of all the worlds precious metals
7276760 only gold combines lustrous beauty easy workability rarity and virtual indestructibility not even diamonds combine these four characteristics
7276761 gold is so soft and malleable one ounce can be stretched into a wire and incredible 5 miles long or hammered into a sheet so thin it covers 100 square feet
7276762 it is so rare that only an estimated 102 000 tons have been taken from the earth during all of recorded history as much as could be contained in a cube with 19 yard sides more steel is poured in one hour than gold has been poured since the beginning of time
7276763 since it does not rust tarnish or corrode gold virtually lasts forever the coins found in sunken galleons centuries old are as bright and shiny as the day they were cast
7276764 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
7276765 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it

7276775 the word of the lord came to jonah son of amittai
7276776 how can you sleep get up and call on your god maybe he will take notice of us and we will not perish
7276777 come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity
7276778 tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us what do you do where do you come from what is your country from what people are you
7276779 i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land
7276780 what should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us
7276781 and it will become calm i know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you
7276782 o lord please do not let us die for taking this mans life do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you o lord have done as you pleased
7276783 when my life was ebbing away i remembered you lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple
7276784 those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord
7276785 he was the one who restored the boundaries of israel from lebo hamath to the sea of the arabah in accordance with the word of the lord the god of israel spoken through his servant jonah son of amittai the prophet from gath hepher
7276786 the word of the lord came to jonah son of amittai
7276787 but jonah ran away from the lord and headed for tarshish
7276788 he went down to joppa where he found a ship bound for that port after paying the fare he went aboard and sailed for tarshish to flee from the lord
7276789 many are the plans in a mans heart but it is the lords purpose that prevails
7276790 remember this fix it in mind take it to heart you rebels remember the former things those of long ago i am god and there is no other i am god and there is none like me i make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come i say my purpose will stand and i will do all that i please from the east i summon a bird of prey from a far off land a man to fulfill my purpose what i have said that will i bring about what i have planned that will i do
7276791 so do not be ashamed to testify about our lord or ashamed of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel by the power of god who has saved us and called us to a holy life not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace
7276792 then the lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up
7276793 how can you sleep get up and call on your god maybe he will take notice of us and we will not perish
7276794 come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity
7276795 tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us what do you do where do you come from what is your country from what people are you
7276796 i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land
7276797 what should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us
7276798 and it will become calm i know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you
7276799 o lord please do not let us die for taking this mans life do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you o lord have done as you pleased
7276800 from inside the fish jonah prayed to the lord his god
7276801 surely the arm of the lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear but your iniquities have separated you from your god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear
7276802 he said in my distress i called to the lord and he answered me from the depths of the grave i called for help and you listened to my cry you hurled me into the deep into the very heart of the seas and the currents swirled about me all your waves and breakers swept over me
7276803 i said i have been banished from your sight yet i will look again toward your holy temple
7276804 the engulfing waters threatened me the deep surrounded me seaweed was wrapped around my head
7276805 when my life was ebbing away i remembered you lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple
7276806 those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord
7276807 and the lord commanded the fish and it vomited jonah onto dry land

7276811 ah perhaps we can end early and go home early
7276812 so i guess in some ways i am feeling more lost than i ever have and at the same time the most excited about what the next turn will expose
7276813 after the initial shock had worn off i realized that there was no blood it seemed strange to me her tights are soaked in urine which most likely occurred after her death but the only traces of blood that i could see were at the roots of her hair
7276814 i think that she was yanked from behind at some point
7276815 did you notice anything odd about the room was it the same as usual
7276816 all four of the bathroom stall doors were open usually some of them are open and some are closed in a random sort of way
7276817 i noticed that the girl didnt have a cell phone or a wallet in her bag she didnt even have keys or an ipod or anything only those clothes and the teddy bear
7276818 what do you make of this costume the tutu the sequins why would she come to the hospital dressed like that
7276819 most likely someone went into labor and she hurried away from whatever she was doing some kind of performance i guess a dance recital maybe its actually pretty common to see all sorts of costumes and uniforms on this floor people never seem to have babies when youd expect them to
7276820 ive seen kids in little league uniforms a hoop skirted museum tour guide and even a dancer of a more um exotic nature
7276821 i thought you just started here last week when did you see all of that
7276822 well i meant over the past few years ive spent a lot of time on the maternity floor just not in this hospital
7276823 i suppose she came in through the stairwell next door the nurses claim they never saw her i dont know what do you think
7276824 well how trustworthy are the night nurses in your opinion
7276825 each night theres a different group of people and i havent met everyone yet im still getting to know the staff
7276826 but i cant imagine a sparkling ballerina walking past the nurses station without the hens clucking about it all night it would have made interesting conversation someone would have noticed
7276827 i bet someone saw her coming in the door a costume like that would be hard to forget
7276828 assuming she came in last night after regular visiting hours how would she get here
7276829 she would have come in through the emergency department and then headed towards the main elevators she probably saw the signs for the stairwell and walked up to the third floor
7276830 and then i suppose she just fell over and died
7276831 anderson make sure the forensics team sweeps the stairwell before they leave
7276832 oh dont worry about that the distributor will pay for it
7276833 seeeee te la das de amigo de los jud os porque dec s que tenes un amigo jud o ja ja y mas j
7276834 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7276835 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7276836 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7276837 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7276838 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth
7276839 obamas mother failed to take the oath in order to regain her u s citizenship therefore obama would not have been able to regain his u s citizenship until he turned 18 years and after he took the oath of allegiance
7276840 since the oath of allegiance would have been entered in the records of the appropriate embassy legation consulate court or the attorney general if plaintiff is incorrect then obama should be able to produce in court a certified copy of the proceedings including a copy of the oath administered
7276841 obama traveled to pakistan using his indonesian passport at the time of travels to indonesia obama was 20 years old he was well aware he maintained his indonesia citizenship and failed to regain his united states citizenship even if obama maintained his united states citizenship which he failed to do he also carries citizenships in kenya and indonesia obama has divided loyalties with foreign countries thus obama carries multiple citizenships and is ineligible to run for president of the united states
7276842 if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship
7276843 the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so the dncs inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary

7276846 los an lisis cr ticos de la teor a del imperialismo de la izquierda internacional
7276847 no es m s que el manto con que se quiere ocultar la dura realidad de la colonizaci n del mundo por el capital
7276848 ver que a pesar de todo el pluralismo y de toda la variedad que se predican lo decisivo es que se est imponiendo el capitalismo como reducci n del mundo a mera mercanc a y que por tanto lo que se globaliza es un modo de producci n y de vida que conlleva una reducci n imperialista la reducci n del capitalismo neoliberal
7276849 uno de los rasgos m s decisivos de la globalizaci n actual a saber su innstrumentalizaci n pol tica por los sectores neoliberales
7276850 con lo cual se oculta uno de los hechos m s duros de la globalizaci n neoliberal a saber que en su curso la econom a no se ha mundializado sino que se ha reorganizado y reestructurado seg n los intereses prevalentes de los tres grandes bloques econ micos estados unidos canad la comunidad europea y japon
7276851 no se puede ignorar que lo que se propaga como global o universal es de hecho una cultura occidental capitalista de primer mundo

7276855 i think that the only reason clarence thomas is on the court is because he is black i dont believe he could have won had he been white and the reason is i think it was a cynical ploy by president bush

7276857 oh ik zal het eens van dichterbij bekijken dan he ja inderdaad
7276858 i want to hear a new song a revolutionary christ song that summons from me greater faith in the new world that god is forming within us likewise i want to hear a spoken wordin the assembly that expresses danger energy possibility an opening for newness so much of our preaching is so overly concerned with the technical questions of getting the truth right that preachers have squeezed all the life out of the gospel we have thought of the gospel as a fragile and precious object and have held it too tightly rendering it shapeless and uninteresting much of what passes for gospel speech these days is not dramatic or artistic it is bound by the reason of technique and overly concerned with correctness it seems stilted and mechanical we believers hear it presented to us week in and week out and by virtue of the very fact that we are believers we put up with it our struggle in the twenty first century will be thet struggle to maintain our commitment to teachings of jesus and the revelation of the gospel in the new testament while endeavoring to rediscover a robust poetic faith that abandons certitude and inanity
7276859 the new fellowship transcends every limit imposed by family class or culture we are not winning people like ourselves to ourselves but sharing the good news that in christ god has shattered the barriers that divide the human race and has created a new community the new people of god has no analogy it is a sociological impossibility that has nevertheless become possible
7276860 a genuine christian environmentalist will recognize that tending and revering the creation is part of gods divine plan for gods people too many christians have spiritualized their faith to the point of marginalizing or ignoring ecology some people are environmentalists primarily for humanitarian or aesthetic concerns others for economic prosperity public attention or political gain exile however are environmentalists precisely because they are christians
7276861 some people believe football is a matter of life and death i am very disappointed with that attitude i can assure you it is much much more important than that
7276862 hes better than brian lara because hes 600 not out what a guy
7276863 should the aggregate score be level after 90 minutes extra time will be played
7276864 how could i leave after a night like that it was the greatest night of my life
7276865 the english club proved that miracles really do exist ive now made liverpool my english team they showed that football is the most beautiful sport of all the liverpool supporters didnt let me go to sleep the night before there were 10 of them to every three milan supporters they showed their unconditional support at half time when they were losing 3 0 and still they didnt stop singing
7276866 liverpools fans are just amazing the best feeling i have at away games is anfield it is just incredible i love it you get goose bumps when you see their supporters sing youll never walk alone
7276867 why didnt you rinse your dishes and put them in the dishwasher
7276868 there were other dishes in the sink before i put mine in there
7276869 i dont care theres no reason why you couldnt at least rinse your own dishes im not anybodys slave around here
7276870 was it you or my mother that left your dishes in the sink
7276871 oh that must have been me i was going to rinse them and put them in the dishwasher now hanging his head i forgot im so stupid ill go do them now
7276872 sort of depends on your definition of death i suppose
7276873 we all do what we have to for the greater good i dont like killing people nor does kali but we do what we have to so that humanity and flourish and evolve were evidence enough of that
7276874 shes the goddess of death and destruction its the role she plays we all play our own roles do you know what survivors guilt is when someone close to you dies someone that youve known and loved passes away the survivor who didnt die feels as though to keep living is worse then death thats what we feel every time we have to kill someone kalis designation is goddess she kills on a large scale compared to me im a glorified assassin
7276875 michael youve been dead to us for nearly 300 years we thought you were never going to reemerge from the populace so weve had to adapt kali herself has been dormant for nearly 700 years so it was a surprise when she just showed up here last year
7276876 yep she just knocked on the front door and walked on in she said you were going to emerge too so she needed rubes help and we went from there
7276877 shes the goddess of death caleb the doorman designation doorman is relatively new she killed the old one
7276878 a new caleb emerged after the old one died rube found him relatively quickly he was a bouncer at a club in norway called the black moon i guess the calebs are doormen in whatever life they have before they emerge
7276879 i didnt think you would yet anyways mesaline is the only one who can
7276880 the last time we stood face to face was in teotihuacan remember
7276881 we stood on the avenue of the dead where we saw the mayans fall do you remember what you said to me that day
7276882 i said if i ever see you again gabriel i would rip your heart out and eat it like you did to me and my family
7276883 its the maskim call demeter and find leti initiate a delta code 7

7276934 we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7276935 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7276936 a disastrous race david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop its our most disappointing race of the year congratulations to sebastian vettel who drove very well today and demonstrated what the chassis is capable of

7276965 throughout the process leading up to the selection of a running mate i expressed confidence that senator obama would make the right choice for the country and the party
7276966 as senator obama charts a new foreign policy away from the failed policies advanced by the bush administration and supported by senator mccain he will have a solid partner in senator biden with his extensive background in foreign affairs
7276967 the selection of joe biden will remind everyone that the future of the supreme court hangs in the balance
7276968 the obama biden team has a consistent record of working in a bipartisan way and provides voters with a dynamic choice of two inspiring leaders its a solid choice that reflects the kind of president barack obama will be one ready to lead american in a new and better direction

7276973 the united states should designate the islamic revolutionary guards corps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the islamic revolutionary guards corps on the list of specially designated global terrorists
7276974 iran through the use of the iranian republican guard corps quds force seeks to turn the shiia militia extremists into a hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces in iraq
7276975 the political power of the occupiers the united states and allied foreign forces in iraq is collapsing rapidly soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region of course we are prepared to fill the gap
7276976 biden said the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action in iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of his final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time

7277000 what weve learnt in the past is you can inclemently improve something by one per cent and it takes two years and millions of pounds and all you get is more of the same you polarise your market youre offering more of the same instead of something new memorable and exciting
7277001 people like to tick boxes and play it safe but sequels are the bane of our industry the last one was good so the board wants ten more the same thats actually harming the marketplace irreparably
7277002 the reality for many small developers is that publishers are risk averse but things are going to change its not going to be like a parent child relationship with publishers in the future its going to become much more of a creative partnership
7277003 people are waking up now to the fact that sequels are actually high risk rather than low risk

7277031 i have not selected him as i do not think that he was focused enough and i did not feel that he would be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7277032 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game

7277050 i did my best but there were big problems first i had to get a permit for construction and your plans did not comply with the codes i had to hire an engineering firm and redraw the plans then i got into a fight with osha over whether or not the ark needed a fire sprinkler system and floatation devices then my neighbor objected claiming i was violating zoning ordinance by building the ark in my front yard so i had to get a variance from the city planning commission i had problems getting enough wood for the ark because there was a ban on cutting trees to protect the spotted owl i finally convinced the u s forest service that i needed the wood to save the owls however the fish and wildlife service wont let me catch any owls so no owls the carpenters formed a union and went out on strike i had to negotiate a settlement with the national labor union now i have 16 carpenters on the ark but no owls when i started rounding up the other animals i got sued by an animal rights group they objected to me only taking two of each kind aboard just when i got the suit dismissed the epa notified me that i could not complete the ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood they didnt take very kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of the creator of the universe then the army corps of engineers demanded a map of the proposed new flood plain i sent them a globe right now i am trying to resolve a complaint filed with the equal employment opportunity commission that i am practicing discrimination by not taking godless unbelieving people aboard the irs has seized all my assets claiming that im building the ark in preparation to flee the country to avoid paying taxes i just got a notice from the state that i owe some kind of user tax and failed to register the ark as a recreational water craft finally the aclu got the courts to issue an injunction against further construction of the ark saying that since god is flooding the earth it is a religious event and therefore unconstitutional i really dont think i can finish the ark for another 5 or 6 years

7277082 they suggest reducing vehicle weights as much as 20 percent weight and size of new cars and work to improve light duty vehicle engines and transmissions with an eye toward fuel efficiency from then through the next 30 years the authors recommend increasing work on advanced technologies such as plug in hybrid electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells advanced powertrains must move to take the majority of the market

7277107 zijn hardlooppogingen heeft hij allang opgegeven zijn marathondromen leiden een vegeterend bestaan ik zwaai naar hem en keer mijn hoofd om zodat ik langzaam de concentratie kan opbouwen die nu nog week is en makkelijk kan loslaten maar hard en ondoordringbaar moet worden zodat ze me aan het einde van de marathon kan beschermen tegen de pijn die ik zal voelen
7277108 niemand begrijpt waarom ik hardloop en eerlijk gezegd zelf begrijp ik het ook nauwelijks of in ieder geval maar bij vlagen zon plotseling inzicht verschilt bovendien altijd weer van het vorige splijtende inzicht over de fundamentele redenen waarom ik ren maar ik hoef het ook niet te begrijpen en dat ik het niet hoef te begrijpen houdt me gaande

7277154 i am starting to wonder if x is completely ignorant in one day it was very obvious that my space was no concern of his first thing he left opened the entire shades in the bedroom window while i was in the shower completely ignoring the fact that my breasts and i have to walk past the window to get to my closet thanks to him everyone in the damn neighborhood knows my cup size
7277155 next he insisted his daughter gets her ears pierced even though she was scared shit less and was hesitant to the whole idea we went anyway know why he said it was important he was there to see her ears pierced shes only 5 theres time for gods sake get there 30 min later one ear is pierced kid is crying hysterical and refuses to get the other one done he leaves disappointed he wasted 46 bucks on one earing i tried to tell him to be patient her first day of kindergarten is approaching but what does he care right
7277156 in the evening we took a walk with my dog he cant just walk he has to do something else ignoring the fact that there are other people walking cars and kids his vincinity he starts playing mobile catch with the dog dog looking above to catch the ball barrels into my leg takes me out at the knee pulls my back and i fall hard on my ass i wont blame the damn dog x was just so caught up on what he wanted to do it didnt matter if it got in the way of others or hurt someone or killed the damn dog
7277157 the really sad thing is i asked him what important aspects of his childs life does he want to be there for he said her first date great so then the kids mom can be there for the first failed test big fall off a bike broken heart and major fight with a friend guess all the mom is good for is mopping up the messes
7277158 if i do x what will that cause for others around me

7277177 lafghanistan vive oggi un momento cruciale principalmente per due fattori il primo che abbiamo nuovamente raggiunto la fine dellinverno e gli insorti condotti dai talebani hanno dichiarato che avrebbero ripreso le proprie attivit in primavera e in estate e tutti i segni che si possono cogliere oggi in afghanistan confermano che lo stanno facendo abbiamo notizie di un numero crescente di combattenti afghani che arrivano dalle montagne e dallestero nelle zone di confine con il pakistan e sul terreno assistiamo ad un numero crescente di diversi tipi di attacchi innanzitutto attacchi suicidi mirati ad obiettivi cruciali che possono essere persone o installazioni militari e questo tipo di attacchi parecchio cresciuto nello scorso anno questo tipo di attacchi significativo perch gli attacchi suicidi non sono una tipica tattica talebana o afghana e ci quindi mostra che un gran numero di giovani afghani stato radicalizzato in campi di addestramento il secondo tipo di attacchi comincia ad avvenire nel quadro di una strategia che vede i talebani spostarsi dal sud per recarsi in zone settentrionali dellafghanistan recentemente vi stato un attacco diciamo convenzionale vicino bagram che ha coinvolto un numero piuttosto nutrito di talebani che hanno conquistato una zona a nord di kabul tra kabul e la base aerea di bagram questo attacco ha dimostrato che vi una debolezza nellalleanza nato nella risposta a questo tipo di attacchi se questi non avvengono a kandahar a helmand e in altro luoghi meridionali e orientali del paese e qui rispondo alla sua seconda domanda cio al grado di controllo del governo karzai sul territorio il governo non ha mai controllato tutto lafganistan e in ogni caso il concetto di controllo del territorio che potrebbe avere un europeo diverso dal concetto di controllo di un afghano il controllo sul territorio si esercita su diverse strutture di potere a un livello molto locale quindi difficile in ogni caso immaginare un controllo totale del governo centrale in afghanistan anche se tornasse una stabilit totale ma in ogni caso torniamo al sud vi un controllo molto blando da parte del governo a kandahar a helmand e su una parte delloruzgan sulla paktika paktia e tutte queste zone al confine con il pakistan
7277178 per il futuro gli sviluppi dipenderanno dal successo che avranno la coalizione guidata dalla nato e le forze di sicurezza afghane nel contrastare il livello crescente di insurrezione e credo che la prossima estate proprio come lestate scorsa sar una stagione di combattimenti intensi per le truppe nato in afghanistan soprattutto a kandahar a helmand forse in oruzgan e nella zona orientale del paese dove si sta svolgendo loperazione enduring freedom condotta dalle truppe usa bisogna vedere se i combattimenti si sposteranno dalle provincie del sud del paese nel modo che ho appena descritto per loperazione abbastanza insolita condotta dai talebani a bagram due settimane fa
7277179 la situazione cambiata notevolmente negli ultimi 12 mesi aumentata la violenza aumentato il numero delle vittime e anche la situazione politica cambiata in quanto il governo meno stabile di quanto fosse un anno fa
7277180 direi che i successi sono stati pochi e lontani luno dallaltro in iraq uno dei successi stata la creazione di una regione curda stabile nel nord delliraq ma se questo successo possa continuare dopo il ritiro delle forza americane e britanniche non glielo so dire ad ogni modo oggi la regione curda una zona stabile dopo anni di repressioni e di sofferenze imposte al popolo curdo per quanto riguarda gli insuccessi vi sicuramente la mancata ricostruzione delleconomia in gran parte a causa del fatto che dopo linvasione invasione che in s stata un successo dopo linvasione dicevo si creato un vuoto che non avrebbe dovuto esserci perch il vuoto ha permesso alle forze che successivamente sono divenuti gli insorti di occupare quello spazio lo smantellamento dellesercito iracheno lo smantellamento del partito baathista le uniche forze che tenevano insieme liraq prima dellinvasione anchesso stato un errore che ha fatto s che tutta la struttura dello stato abbia collassato completamente ed questo il motivo per il quale oggi il governo sta avendo enormi difficolt a governare il paese perch deve iniziare da una posizione di partenza pari allo 0 ma nel mezzo di uninsurrezione non come cominciare da zero su un foglio bianco in un ambiente stabile ma si tratta di iniziare su un foglio bianco ma in un ambiente di estrema instabilit vediamo che i partiti sciiti vanno via dal parlamento moqtada al sadr il leader del movimento militante sciita divenuto pi militante e vedremo fenomeni simili in futuro particolarmente nel sud laltro problema un vero fallimento pi che un errore stato il non aver ricostruito lindustria petrolifera secondo le ultime stime solo per avere unidea delle dimensioni la produzione di petrolio iracheno ha il potenziale di essere superiore a quella iraniana ma lindustria petrolifera non stata ricostruita questo stato un fallimento davvero cruciale e sara a mio avviso il bersaglio principale della violenza e dellinstabilit in futuro in quanto sebbene sunniti e sciiti si battano oggi per il controllo politico dobbiamo ricordare che i giacimenti petroliferi si trovano nel sud dominato dagli sciiti e che il centro sunnita teme di non ottenere alcun beneficio dalle regioni ricche di petrolio e a seguito del ritiro delle truppe americane e britanniche questa contesa pu trasformarsi in una guerra civile

7277201 there is a very large norwich presence in the museum
7277202 maj gen greenway is just the right man for this important task
7277203 he is dedicated and detail oriented he knows a lot about the universitys history and the importance of properly cataloging all of our collection both inside and outside the museum walls

7277219 they never considered themselves in danger theres a sense of security here

7277232 technology vendors will deliver cloud infrastructure but those details must be linked for us all or the cloud will just be nothing more than a buzz word
7277233 we cant spend all of our time arguing about how to implement the cloud and almost no time talking about whether our business can fit the cloud model
7277234 cloud computing is a popular phrase that is shorthand for applications that were developed to be rich internet applications that run on the internet or
7277235 cloud computing is a computing paradigm in which tasks are assigned to a combination of connections software and services accessed over a network
7277236 cloud computing offers exciting benefits for users but it may also challenge the historic direction of the business models of companies like microsoft whose products are for the most part still tethered to desktops and laptops
7277237 data clouds have emerged as the preferred platform for distributed computing when working with large amounts of data
7277238 sector is the first of a second generation of data clouds that are based on new network protocols designed to work with the very large data sets that are common in e science and that are beginning to become more common in e business
7277239 we have extensively used the sector data cloud and the teraflow network to distribute multi terabyte astronomical datasets to the whole world we are also working to implement large scale streaming queries across large astronomical archives to support the users of the national virtual observatory
7277240 the problem is that even well funded universities have a tough time putting students into compute environments that give them experience writing applications that use and manage multiple machines over a network
7277241 cloud computing is the technology that links computers together to process information simultaneously
7277242 most of the innovation in cloud computing has been led by corporations but industry executives and computer scientists say a shortage of skills and talent could limit future growth we in academia and the government labs have not kept up with the times said bryant universities really need to get on board
7277243 cloud computing is part of an emerging shift towards research that involves large amounts of computing power but additionally depends on the analysis of massive amounts of data to enable scientific discovery fields such as astrophysics high energy particle physics biology oceanography geoscience and environmental science are already building instruments that are capable of creating petabytes of data per day and in computer science we are beginning to see practical approaches to machine learning language translation and image processing that improve almost linearly with the amount of computing power and data available
7277244 in 2006 when i helped christophe bisciglia a former uw student now a senior engineer at google to develop the program our goal was to understand the challenges that universities face in teaching important new concepts such as large scale computing and develop methods to address this issue a year later weve seen how our students have mastered many of the techniques that are critical for large scale internet computing benefiting our department and students
7277245 the potential synergy between my manycore desktop laptop phone and the cloud go far beyond the current generation of grid middleware we anticipate having dozens of agents running on our personal devices interacting with the cloud and monitoring the computations and data feeds on topics of interest to us the explosion of networked sensor data and video feeds together with advanced data mining and image recognition tools all running continuously on a manycore client can drive rule based systems that know how to alert us when something of interest happens
7277246 google and i b m join in cloud computing research
7277247 even the nations elite universities do not provide the technical training needed for the kind of powerful and highly complex computing google is famous for say computer scientists
7277248 google and ibm expanding an effort that began at the university of washington will launch an initiative to help computer science students and researchers learn a form of programming increasingly significant in the internet age
7277249 ibm yahoo and google are all putting the power of cloud computing to work heres a short primer on how the new technology works researchers seeking smarter ways to tackle the most complicated computing tasks think theyve found the answer in a cloud though not the kind that wafts across the sky as masses of condensed water droplets and frozen crystals instead theyre turning to something called cloud computing which aims to deliver supercomputing power over the internet
7277250 you may win the nobel prize by analyzing data assembled by someone else
7277251 mark dean head of ibms research operation in almaden calif
7277252 the web is tiny well be laughing at how small the web is
7277253 cloud computing isnt defined by particular data centre architectures nevertheless cloud computing can be seen as a logical evolution of grid and utility computing ideas the massive petabyte level scale of cloud storage would bring the cost gb of storage to the fore and rule out traditional controller based array building blocks on cost grounds a rough consensus view seems to be that clustered nas systems will be a common cloud storage architecture the google type clustered server das infrastructure is unique to google and its particularly search focused needs a clustered nas system is more generally applicable and needs to have a very large and global namespace for its files and an infrastructure for organising millions of files file protection and access
7277254 cloud computing looks very much like the instantiation of many vendors visions of the data center of the future its an abstracted fabric based infrastructure that enables dynamic movement growth and protection of services that is billed like a utility it also has all the earmarks of a disruptive innovation it is enterprise technology packaged to best fit the needs of small businesses and start ups not the enterprise
7277255 this is the next generation of computer architecture and ibm wants to get in front of it
7277256 the companies also are united by a rivalry with microsoft and theyd like to influence the future of online business before microsoft extends its influence
7277257 in some ways the cloud is a natural next step from the grid utility model whats different is the google programming model and that really opens things up you dont have to be a stanford or carnegie mellon ph d to program cloud applications
7277258 watch for vendor rhetoric around cloud computing to expand during 2008 as more infrastructure and application platform vendors jump into the game participating vendors technology standards and a rich set of enterprise offerings are unlikely to stabilize before 2010
7277259 cloud computing as the term is popularly used refers to the delivery of a range of it capabilities such as infrastructure applications as an externally sourced service
7277260 the big goal is how the technology industry can encourage the next generation of computer scientists to figure out how to build software that can run in these massively parallel environments
7277261 its a fundamental shift in computer science what we are looking at here is an exercise to try and make parallel computing applicable to every day computer problems in the long run about five to 10 years these programs will start to show results
7277262 there are few important elements that i see in this this is a move beyond grid or utility computing blending in elements of web 2 0 and social networking aiming to unlock a greater amount of innovation driven by the social elements that are key to unlocking innovation this moves utility computing further up the technology stack than before
7277263 the ability to rapidly provision new capacity is increased substantially lots of different configurations can be deployed quickly the integration of tivoli products is one of the key enablers here the degree of technical flexibility is strong the other tivoli element to the announcement is that there is fine grained tracking of usage that can be used as the basis for different types of charging and pricing regimes
7277264 as the data center continues to evolved the network will as well the virtualized data centers of the future will be built on pools of resources that will be interconnected by the network in essence the network will become the backplane of the virtual data center and play many roles the network will be application fluent and be the service orchestration engine that will govern what resources go to which applications the network is where many soa services will reside and the network will automatically provision resources when and where they are needed
7277265 its not just about the enterprise just about the consumer or just about delivering entire applications
7277266 few people argue with the basic premise that cloud computing can be a great tool for enterprises however many issues must be worked through before it is called on to handle core applications and sensitive data it and other decision makers must be confident of clouds security and reliability today however there are non mission critical applications that businesses especially smbs readily send into the clouds
7277267 organizations have to move from traditional client server and soa based applications that are dependent on static allocation of resources whats happening here is virtualization granted everyone is pounding on that term helping to break those barriers down from the technological perspective
7277268 i think there will also be a generational shift here
7277269 cloud computing is a critical piece of the infrastructure that allows companies such as google yahoo amazon and microsoft to provide their services a cloud provides computing resources or services over the internet a storage cloud provides storage services a data cloud provides data management services and a computing cloud provides computational services often these are layered to create a stack of cloud services that provide a computing platform for developing cloud based applications
7277270 computing in the cloud is one name for services that run in a web browser and store information in a providers data center ranging from adaptations of familiar tools such as email and personal finance to new offerings such as virtual worlds and social networks
7277271 this panel explores the new services might develop and how will todays services might evolve
7277272 designed to provide data center optimization increased energy efficiency and lower deployment and overall management overhead for customers whose it infrastructure or compute cloud is the
7277273 we are laying out a roadmap for new microsoft business division services and investments designed to increase computing options and break down barriers for everyone from individuals to large corporations
7277274 the new offerings and programs represent the next phase of the divisions strategy for online services
7277275 cisco builds on its data center leadership and innovation with the introduction of the new cisco nexus family of products and additions to its cisco catalyst series the cisco nexus family was developed to meet customer demands for more efficient and sustainable next generation data centers new modular fixed and blade additions to the catalyst series continue to build on switch innovations and an architectural approach specifically designed to unify all components of the data center
7277276 the real news is a new layer of software called a fabric that is designed to orchestrate the efforts of the various kinds of technology found within any data center rather than just oversee the cisco gear that moves bits in and out of the building this fabric can also be used to control the servers that process those bits the storage gear that holds them and the applications that do something useful with them
7277277 the domestic and apac arm of indias third largest software exporter is also venturing into cloud computing
7277278 we plan to take two approaches to the market firstly tap the top 300 400 customers in a market and secondly offer cloud computing services to the mid market customers
7277279 though early days yet many mid market customers will start questioning why should they invest on their own infrastructure when they can avail of services like this cloud computing is a future business driver for us wipro infotech plans to soon structure its business into on premise computing and cloud computing
7277280 cloud computing or platform as a service has enormous potential for the enterprise
7277281 cloud computing offers almost unlimited computing power and collaboration at a massive scale with force com platform as service we are providing the necessary building blocks to make cloud computing real for the enterprise
7277282 what are the probable futures of massive broadband clouds in america with the statutory transition from digital to analog television less than three years away the possibilities may be endless but the probabilities are much easier to calculate as the various frequencies that are currently occupied by analog television signals become available at auction we should see an extraordinary amount of activity by the big internet communications media entertainment and electronics companies all moving towards a single goal life in the cloud
7277283 i dont think middle america got interested in him because his mixtapes were so great but they forced serious rap fans to care about everything he was doing then he landed on a pop hit with lollipop which was something he had never been able to do before and between that and the serious rap fans it became an event
7277284 that speaks to the quantity of his output which is plentiful as well as the depth of his audiences engagement if youre a fan youre most likely a serious fan and while people who like an individual song are not going to open their wallets for you people who like 10 songs will i think the mixtape phenomenon is great for feeding the machine which is what the music industry is about in the 21st century
7277285 the most powerful group of iraqis ever gathered outside of iraq to talk about peace and finding a way forward together
7277286 now two people from northern ireland who just a decade ago wouldnt fly on the same plane are working jointly to share their story with the iraqis and tell them how they now work together in the same government
7277287 in the north of brazil you have the techno brega movement you have a music producer who has a recording studio probably a small one with good equipment they invite the artists to these studios to make the cds they deliver it to the street vendors so that they can replicate them the only people making a profit out of cd sales are the street vendors the musicians dont expect any money from releasing the cds
7277288 the aparelhagem or the sound system is an important element in techno brega culture the different sound systems complete against each other about who has the most cutting edge updated equipment they already realize that cds are not a good business model cds are merely an advertisement they organize parties in weekends where you have 5000 people coming then you make money
7277289 free is not quite as simple or as stupid as it sounds just because products are free doesnt mean that someone somewhere isnt making huge gobs of money
7277290 my dear you are a young woman you are writing about a book that has been written by a man be sympathetic be tender flatter deceive use all the arts and wiles of our sex never let anybody guess that you have a mind of your own above all be pure
7277291 it is far more difficult to murder a phantom than a reality
7277292 it doesnt matter that im mexican american born in east la raised in utah lived in dc and worked on the south side of chicago what matters is what im doing now and how im helping my neighbor my brother
7277293 this is not about class nor color race nor creed its about the changes what the americans need
7277294 certain types of discourse are better suited to the web there has been so much talk about how this campaign is all about style and no substance and this video contradicts that there are reasons that we support obama and it has to do with the issues you cant get that on cnn right now you cant get that on msnbc right now and young people saw it on youtube and they took it
7277295 hey fred did you wash your hands after using the bathroom

7277303 an ever closer union among the european peoples is vervlogen
7277304 de europese mantel is te groot zegt de vooraanstaande duitse filosoof peter sloterdijk
7277305 nederlanders hebben tot uitdrukking gebracht dat ze toch liever nederlander zijn in plaats van europeaan
7277306 de nederlanders kunnen geen vier weken overleven zonder de band met brussel
7277307 daardoor geloven burgers dat de natiestaat het maximum aan zekerheid biedt in de vorige eeuw stond de vrijheid nog hoog in het vaandel dat interesseert niemand meer het hoofdthema van onze tijd is zekerheid sociale zekerheid
7277308 de werkgelegenheid bij logistics hangt af van de snel veranderende vraag in de markt
7277309 mobieltjes mp3 spelers en dat soort dingen worden bijna allemaal in het najaar verkocht in aanloop naar sinterklaas en kerstmis dan hebben wij mensen nodig
7277310 alleen werd het destijds geen globalisering genoemd maar internationale arbeidsverdeling
7277311 als ik n les heb geleerd is het pas je zo snel mogelijk aan scherm je je te lang af dan komen de gevolgen van de toenemende concurrentie in n keer over je heen in de vorm van massale ontslagen
7277312 mensen moeten weerbaar worden gemaakt ze moeten zich inspannen door te leren zich bij te scholen de staat en bedrijven kunnen hierbij een handje helpen
7277313 mensen moeten zoveel mogelijk meedoen dat betekent niet dat ze altijd hetzelfde werk houden
7277314 toen de conjunctuur de verkeerde kant opging ontstond vijandigheid tegenover migranten daar kwamen nog eens al die gasten uit oost europa bij maar ik bestrijd dat de europese unie een vijand is van een hoog peil van werkgelegenheid of welvaartsgroei
7277315 met de europese grondwet is te hoog ingezet maar als de politiek kan laten zien wat de toegevoegde waarde is van europese samenwerking zal het vertrouwen van de burgers in de europese unie weer groeien
7277316 we doen wel alsof na het nee de euroscepsis plotseling is toegeslagen
7277317 maar de belangstelling voor europa is al heel lang heel laag dat houdt risicos in zodra je het publiek naar zijn mening vraagt europa breng je alleen dichterbij door politieke discussie
7277318 maar ik wil ook dat we thuiskomen met een nieuw europees verdrag dat recht doet aan de zorgen van de nederlandse bevolking
7277319 we kunnen ons niet de arrogantie permitteren om te zeggen laat europa maar zitten
7277320 maar de volgende stap zetten en zelf iets bedenken dat doen ze niet de hi rarchische manier van denken belemmert dit en wetenschap gedijt juist bij vrijheid en debat in europa kan een jonge onderzoeker zeggen wat u beweert klopt niet europas kracht zit in de rebelse geest
7277321 de krachten bundelen opdat het beste uit de europese landen wordt gehaald daar moet de eu op inzetten
7277322 met het technologische innovatieprogramma van de europese commissie zevende kaderprogramma red worden projecten gefinancierd die zelfs een groot bedrijf als philips zelfstandig moeilijk rond krijgt
7277323 wij willen wereldleider worden in energiezuinigheid in milieuvriendelijke technologie n
7277324 maar we kunnen niet uitsluitend inzetten op innovatie nederland en andere europese landen moeten ook productielanden blijven als ik minister plasterk van onderwijs hoor praten krijg ik de indruk dat iedereen tot zijn dertigste op de universiteit moet zitten we kunnen niet alleen een arbeidsmarkt voor willy wortels hebben
7277325 europa zou als een airbag moeten functioneren tegen de negatieve gevolgen van globalisering
7277326 flexicurity is een bewuste beleidsstrategie om de arbeidsmarkt soepeler te maken door flexibele contracten en tegelijkertijd werk en inkomenszekerheid te scheppen vooral ten behoeve van outsiders op de arbeidsmarkt
7277327 ondernemers moeten zich voortdurend aanpassen en willen daardoor sneller van personeel afkunnen maar ook nieuwe werknemers kunnen aannemen
7277328 maar in diverse europese landen wordt dit verhinderd door de sterke ontslagbescherming voor werknemers daardoor wijken ondernemers uit naar goedkope oproepkrachten en tijdelijk personeel die nauwelijks rechtszekerheid en aanspraken op sociale zekerheid hebben hierdoor wordt de kloof tussen insiders werknemers met een vast dienstverband en werkloze outsiders en contractwerkers steeds groter er dreigt in europa ook in nederland een soort onderklasse op de arbeidsmarkt te ontstaan
7277329 uit onderzoek blijkt dat meer flexibiliteit voor werkgevers goed samen kan gaan met zekerheid voor werkenden een bedrijf als flextronic logistics biedt goede opstapmogelijkheden voor outsiders
7277330 maar werknemers moeten w l de kans krijgen om door te groeien
7277331 de huidige economische omstandigheden zijn gunstig om de flexicurity strategie in europa te introduceren
7277332 oudere werknemers zouden hiermee gemakkelijker ander werk kunnen verrichten meer vrouwen zouden op latere leeftijd de arbeidsmarkt op kunnen en migrantenjongeren zijn aan werk te helpen we waren in nederland goed op weg met de wet flex en zekerheid maar we zullen ook de discussie over ontslagbescherming en hernieuwde zekerheid voor vaste werknemers bevredigend moeten afronden als we de komende periode van economische groei en een krimpende bevolking niet hiervoor gebruiken lukt het nooit om de outsiders met name allochtonen te integreren deze groep groeit en wordt gefrustreerder daarmee loop de sociale vrede gevaar we moeten europa inzetten als een deel van de oplossing in plaats van als het probleem
7277333 i cant understand what has happened to the stone but its an awful thing for someone to do
7277334 people go around nicking road signs but a persons gravestone is very personal and the person who took it needs help i suspect it could be on someones mantlepiece and that one day they may try and sell it back to us but its hard to say
7277335 the person who took it cannot be a true fan and its a shame for the people who come a long way to see the grave and put flowers on it
7277336 i am glad there is a replacement as i often go to visit the cemetery but it was a shock that the old one had gone
7277337 people havent stopped coming to visit the site even with no stone and they come from all over the world
7277338 like the rest of us the fans think that its sad that the thief didnt show more respect
7277339 unfortunately we have nothing more to go on at the moment
7277340 its strange as we thought the stone would turn up or we would get information as the theft has had so much publicity its a global news story so im sure we would know if someone had tried to sell it on whoever has the stone obviously intends to keep it but if anyone knows anything it could still help the investigation
7277341 the person who took it cannot be a true fan and its a shame for the people who come a long way to see the grave and put flowers on it
7277342 ga terug naar je lichaam en naar het land vanwaar je bent gekomen als je tijd om is zal ik je roepen je bent nog niet klaar met de taak waarvoor je bent geboren ga terug naar je stam eens zul je zijn opperhoofd zijn het oude opperhoofd aan wie je je lichaam hebt gegeven zal je uitleggen waaruit je taak bestaat schenk hem gehoor en eens zul je terugkomen op dit eiland nu echter moet je haar die je hierheen heeft gebracht verlaten als je doet wat ik zeg zul je haar eens terugzien want zij mag altijd hier blijven ze blijft jong en mooi als op de dag dat ik haar uit het land van sneeuw en winter hierheen heb geroepen

7277355 if a man will not hear the church let him be as the heathen
7277356 you shall attend mass on sundays and holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor
7277357 you shall confess your sins at least once a year
7277358 you shall receive the sacrament of the eucharist at least during the easter season

7277607 well evangeline i was thinking about some secret toast and jam or maybe just some secret toast
7277608 what i do know is that little boys often grow up to be like their fathers when i was single i decided i wouldnt marry a man unless i could be proud if we had a son who turned out exactly like him
7277609 i knew my teammates were a little bit faster than me but i was still able to win
7277610 the championship is still very close and well see what happens at donington i hope to be able to win there
7277611 we did start pretty well but in corner one i was over the kerb and lewis was close as we approached the second corner where honestly i was going for it
7277612 but i saw felipe braking early and it was too much risk if i overshot the corner id have crashed into him so i choose to stay where i was
7277613 we finished well away from two other cars but the key to this result was qualifying just three tenths off pole is remarkable it is our real pace we are a bit far away but we still try to do our best
7277614 i saw a plastic bag flying and i couldnt avoid it
7277615 it went under car and suddenly i couldnt steer anymore for two corners it was extremely dangerous and i never had it before
7277616 fortunately when i approached the high speed corner it flew away but my confidence had gone away
7277617 we have had quite a strong weekend i have had a traumatic weekend i had a few problems health wise but seemed to pull through
7277618 i have a great team behind me to help we got some good points this weekend so overall a solid weekend for us
7277619 at the start obviously i was on the dirty side i got a reasonably start but nowhere near as quick as felipe i had to hold my spot and robert kubica was pushing quite hard for a couple of corners i was trying to keep up with felipe he was in front and it was pretty hard to overtake here
7277620 i thought id keep a certain gap but at the end he started to stretch it out it was good to know we were a couple of laps heavier
7277621 after such a bad result to come here to a new track which was new for everybody
7277622 we did a fantastic job there is nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result which we still need to work on as we had another problem with kimi
7277623 we have to move forward and there are so many important races in front i am so happy after such a disaster in hungary
7277624 when he was passing by we were side by side i was the leader and he was a lapped car the wall was narrow i didnt want to take the risk

7277653 and nobody that we play to live cares either frankly but as a storyteller you need a new story every once in a while i think you make a record for yourselves and nowadays and especially in todays pop market if you will with music being so segregated you know rap over here and country over here there is no station for us so its liberating in a way
7277654 weve done these package tours with fellow 80s era band chicago

7277662 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make

7277672 i am one of the two coolest people i know
7277673 youll know my unit by all the pink flowers on the deck
7277674 women and the way in which their homes reflect their blending of two cultures
7277675 what if an ad agency wants to purchase an image from your personal work for an ad piece or a commerical product
7277676 if it allows the photographer to buy a plane ticket to go back to the place where they made the work in the first place then why not
7277677 we battle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers
7277678 culture learned and shared human patterns or models for living day to day living patterns these patterns and models pervade all aspects of human social interaction culture is mankinds primary adaptive mechanism
7277679 culture is the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one category of people from another
7277680 whereas membership can imply passive belonging and little else partnership includes the idea of active involvement participation making an investment and taking responsibility
7277681 whereas the theology known as the openness of god revises understanding of gods attributes particularly his omniscience
7277682 i could care less if god can or cannot make a rock so big he cant lift it because omnipotence is not defined by god being able to do absolutely everything no questions asked
7277683 i am the lord and since i know absolutely everything im going to tell you exactly what you will do in the next thirty minutes down to the amount of blinks scratches and sneezes you will experience down to every thought you will think and every word you will speak i am the lord
7277684 lamb has been slain from the foundation of the world
7277685 remember this and be assured recall to mind you transgressors
7277686 open theism openness of god tries to make a case that god is unknowing of the future according to wikipedia this theology runs contrary to the scriptures
7277687 remember this and be assured recall to mind you transgressors
7277688 how can we say that he sometimes knows but not always
7277689 he gives us free will but he sees all time at once from his heavenly perspective
7277690 i already know every word you will say and every word i will say in return youre entire prayer life is as if its already been recorded
7277691 open theism openness of god tries to make a case that god is unknowing of the future according to wikipedia this theology runs contrary to the scriptures
7277692 remember this and be assured recall to mind you transgressors
7277693 how can we say that he sometimes knows but not always
7277694 he gives us free will but he sees all time at once from his heavenly perspective
7277695 i already know every word you will say and every word i will say in return youre entire prayer life is as if its already been recorded
7277696 open theism also called free will theism and openness theology is the belief that god does not exercise meticulous control of the universe but leaves it
7277697 our rejection of divine timelessness and our affirmation of dynamic omniscience are the most controversial elements in our proposal and the view of foreknowledge receives the most attention however the watershed issue in the debate is not whether god has exhaustive definite foreknowledge edf but whether god is ever affected by and responds to what we do this is the same watershed that divides calvinism from arminianism
7277698 open theists argue that people are created to be in meaningful relationships with god and others and as moral beings must have the ability to make real responsible choices in their lives open theists argue that this cannot be accomplished as long as god exercises exhaustive control of the universe or predetermines the future because this would remove humanitys free will
7277699 oh yes my day sorry about that dear i was thinking about something um yes my day it was fine could you tell me what you are going to say next so that i know what god already knows youre going to say
7277700 ah i see youre going to say huh okay well go ahead now and say it
7277701 what are you talking about did you get fired today or something
7277702 hey wait thats not what you said you were going to say
7277703 no i didnt get fired i just youre just to supposed to say huh
7277704 oh forget it now its too late maybe you werent supposed to say huh after all maybe you were supposed to say whatever it was that you said after that what was it you said again
7277705 kids get your coats were going out for dinner tonight to celebrate your dad getting fired today
7277706 oh my me i didnt see that coming great now what do i do these humans you just never know what theyre going to do next
7277707 well can god make a rock so big that he cant pick it up again see my very first post
7277708 i could care less if god can or cannot make a rock so big that he cannot pick it up god doesnt have to be able to do absolutely everything in order to be ominipotent he only need be able to do anything and everything that is not a contradiction and does not violate the nature of who and what god is
7277709 the openness of god a biblical challenge to the traditional understanding of god
7277710 now we see through a glass darkly now we know in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now we know in part but then we shall know even as also we are known to god
7277711 course hes not safe but hes good hes the king i tell you
7277712 my decisions work backward in time to give god his foreknowledge
7277713 took the necessary steps to box peter in a corner
7277714 what would you do if god gave you a detailed prophecy of what you would do
7277715 what would you do if god told you what you would do
7277716 whereas the free methodist church is committed to promoting accord with sound doctrine titus 2 1 and whereas the theology known as the openness of god revises understanding of gods attributes particularly his omniscience
7277717 keith may have little desire to protect free will its pretty clear that other open theists do hence the name of david basingers book the case for freewill theism i stand by my statement
7277718 all the soldiers disciples officials servants and others involved in this scenario
7277719 when you leave today youll find two men by rachels grave oh and the donkeys you were looking for have been found you will continue on and end up in the plain of tabor where youll meet three people going up to god each will be carrying specific items theyll give you two loaves of bread after that youll go to the hill of god and eventually meet a company of prophets the spirit of the lord will come upon you and you will prophecy and please note that when these signs come to you that you do for yourself what the occasion requires
7277720 my decisions work backward in time to give god his foreknowledge
7277721 in this way the jews at jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the gentiles acts 21 10 11
7277722 how is god able to make such accurate predictions open theism only has two options for explaining gods accuracy either hes a really good guesser or else hes got to override free will at key points in order to fulfill his predictions in which case human moral accountability at those key points is lost
7277723 there is no logical incompatibility between god foreknowing everything but not revealing that foreknowledge to me on the one hand or between god revealing foreknowledge to me and my freely doing what hes revealed on the other hand
7277724 okay listen up this is lesson 101 on gods edf knowledge
7277725 if as keith believes god knows our minds and hearts then why should keith bother to pray aloud at all after all god already knows whats in his heart and mind
7277726 wow whatever choice i make someday historians will write down what i did and i wont be able to change it what a damper on my free will
7277727 i thought we had abolished slavery in the mid 1860s people today are above that practice what do you mean by slavery wage slaves well maybe in third world countries but not here in the united states
7277728 to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them god shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book or if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city which are written in this book
7277729 we know that there is no inherent power in the letter of scripture read the sound thereof heard
7277730 the primary function of the church is not evangelism but to be a place for the dwelling of god on the earth this requires that people grow and receive god and occupy their place with god that would have a natural effect of evangelism what we want is not just evangelism that makes converts we want disciples and if you are intent on making disciples and keep on that track evangelism will take care of itself of course understanding that evangelism is a natural function of a healthy body doesnt preclude specific efforts but the role of the community would be a primary factor in this many people will be drawn in without any special strategy but simply by the health of the people
7277731 the mission of the free methodist church is to make known to all people everywhere gods call to wholeness through forgiveness and holiness in jesus christ and to invite into membership and equip for ministry all who respond in faith
7277732 then you shall take delight in the lord and ride upon the heights of the earth
7277733 sowing a seed of 58 dollars a month into a ministry and with your desires in the memo line of the check
7277734 your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt you will raise up the foundations of many generations you shall be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of streets to live in
7277735 6remember this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously 7each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver 8and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work
7277736 dont let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
7277737 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto every good work
7277738 two or three people speaking in an orderly fashion one at a time with an interpreter
7277739 therefore my brethren desire earnestly to prophesy and do not forbid to speak in tongues but all things msut be done properly and in an orderly manner
7277740 the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of thee
7277741 in him you have been enriched in every way in all your speaking and in all your knowledge because our testimony about christ was confirmed in you therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our lord jesus christ to be revealed
7277742 every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting shadows
7277743 i would rather speak five words with my understanding than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
7277744 we believe in god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth

7277759 i thought of making it the newspaper report into a film but may be making it into a way that its like a fable with morals and things like that but unlike moral it has a lot of surprises but basically its about a journey of a boy who goes to find his donkey back and through his journey he meet all these interesting characters and its a very big tussle for the boy to go and get his donkey back so during this event there are so many things that happen
7277760 its the setting of the film about something that you can relate to because it is a place like kashmir which is always in the news for conflict and in todays world people relate to such things all over the world so it has a universal appeal too
7277761 to date most attention has been given to the plight of women trafficked into the sex trade but we have also found evidence of trafficking into scotland for domestic and agricultural labour
7277762 the case information we have been given also shows there are different methods of trafficking and different routes into scotland
7277763 we have come across an example of marriage being used as a mechanism of trafficking women into scotland for sexual exploitation and we have seen cases of trafficked persons being recovered at the port of stranraer
7277764 if we look back at the last races weve seen similar pit exits where stewards havent taken action
7277765 sutil kept his line and didnt lose time so i would be very surprised if we are penalised but lets wait and see what the stewards decide
7277766 the system is not automatic the lights are controlled by human beings
7277767 it was a little bit of a shame to fight with him in the pit lane because he would have had to have let me pass
7277768 we came so close to the wall and i had to back off which cost me a bit of time fortunately the gap was enough to go on and win the race
7277769 i stopped behind him on the pit stop but we left together we were side by side and it was quite narrow so i backed off i didnt want to take a risk
7277770 i think its amazing so after such a bad weekend we come here and just did a fantastic job
7277771 preparing the car on friday saturday morning and chosing the right tyres was pretty difficult especially in qualiyfing
7277772 then making pole poisitoin winning the race and making the fastestt lap i couldnt ask for more than that especially after a bad result
7277773 we are moving forward we have time to work and there are many important races in front of us
7277774 they went off so quickly in the first kilometre i deliberately backed off the pace
7277775 but i always thought more athletes would start coming back and they did
7277776 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can maybe i didnt get my pacing quite right but im satisfied with the run
7277777 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7277778 in kenya we have many medals but im glad to have this one it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7277779 it was incredible what the africans managed to do in those last 10km
7277780 no one is perfect no one is going to make the play every single time obviously theres going to be bad plays no one is perfect you are not going to throw a great ball every time if i worried about that i wouldnt be playing football

7277782 io e mio fratello siamo gli unici rappresentanti di nery castillo in italia dice alessandro marino e abbiamo avuto il mandato di trattare il giocatore ieri ci siamo sentiti con prad alla roma il giocatore interessa ci incontreremo con la dirigenza giallorossa la prossima settimana a differenza di quello che si dice il giocatore pi che disponibile a trasferirsi nella capitale oltre al club giallorosso abbiamo ricevuto offerte dal betis siviglia e da unaltra squadra italiana che non posso citare
7277783 volendo potrebbe firmare oggi con il betis ma il giocatore vorrebbe misurarsi in un grande club potrebbe essere unoperazione molto vantaggiosa anche per la roma i termini economici sono quelli del prestito oneroso cio pagare una minima somma allo shaktar societ che ne detiene il cartellino ndr adesso per poi riscattare lintero cartellino nel 2009 nery sarebbe disposto anche a decurtarsi lingaggio che di poco inferiore ai 2 3 milioni per venire a roma e un classe 84 ed ha passaporto italiano dal punto di vista tecnico castillo unesterno che pu giocare anche da seconda punta secondo me lideale per la roma ed per questo che lho proposto a prad comunque tra luned e marted ci incontreremo e vauteremo bene e velocemente la situazione perch il tempo stringe

7277791 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7277792 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7277793 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there
7277794 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team
7277795 to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7277796 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7277797 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that
7277798 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7277799 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7277800 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7277801 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7277802 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me
7277803 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday

7277806 the unprecedented changes in technology have led to new patterns of thinking especially in young people
7277807 suddenly all my baby boomer ways of learning and thinking for which i had heretofore received ample rewards did not work
7277808 changing our relationship to technology and rewriting the age old paradigm of how things work
7277809 the digital young are revolutionaries unlike the clucking boomers they are not talking revolution theyre making one
7277810 the new web is a very different thing its a tool for bringing together the small contributions of millions of people and making them matter silicon valley consultants call it web 2 0 as if it were a new version of some old software but its really a revolution

7277838 whether its today or two years ago when the markets were much better is not being properly diversified
7277839 the majority of people who own stocks or stock mutual funds concentrate on the biggest u s stocks the standard amp poors 500
7277840 but as of july 31 if you look at the last five years the s amp p 500 is up 7 03 percent while the russell 2000 which basically covers small company stock is up 9 8 percent
7277841 during that same five years the eafe europe australasia far east index for international stocks is up 15 4 percent take this over 10 years and youll see the same things apply
7277842 but it pales in comparison to some of the down markets were had before

7277845 we do not feel that individual stocks make sense for anyone to try to go out there and find the winners yourself is very difficult professional managers are the way to go for both small and large investors

7277860 in a free society healthy public debate requires giving people some leeway to speak but accusing people of criminal acts without any evidence is defamation if people are going to start resorting to that any kind of intelligent public discourse is going to break down

7278121 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7278122 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7278123 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7278124 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7278125 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7278126 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7278127 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7278128 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7278129 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7278130 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7278131 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7278132 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7278133 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7278134 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7278135 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7278136 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7278137 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7278138 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7278139 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7278140 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7278141 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7278142 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7278143 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7278144 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7278145 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7278146 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7278147 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7278148 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7278149 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7278150 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7278151 ce serait un bien bel homme sil n tait pas laid il est grand b ti en hercule mais un teint africain des yeux vifs pleins desprit la v rit
7278152 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7278153 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7278154 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7278155 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7278156 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7278157 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7278158 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7278159 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7278160 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7278161 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7278162 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7278163 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7278164 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7278165 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7278166 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7278167 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7278168 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7278169 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7278170 it is really who we put in congress that matters
7278171 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7278172 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7278173 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7278174 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7278175 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7278176 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7278177 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7278178 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7278179 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7278180 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7278181 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7278182 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7278183 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7278184 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7278185 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7278186 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7278187 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7278188 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7278189 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7278190 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7278191 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7278192 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7278193 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7278194 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7278195 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7278196 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7278197 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7278198 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith

7278207 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7278208 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7278209 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7278210 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7278211 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
7278212 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
7278213 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
7278214 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
7278215 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
7278216 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
7278217 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7278218 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7278219 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7278220 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7278221 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7278222 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7278223 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7278224 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7278225 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7278226 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7278227 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7278228 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7278229 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7278230 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7278231 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7278232 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7278233 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7278234 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7278235 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7278236 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7278237 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7278238 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7278239 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7278240 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7278241 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7278242 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7278243 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7278244 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7278245 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7278246 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7278247 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7278248 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7278249 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7278250 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7278251 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7278252 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7278253 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7278254 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7278255 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7278256 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7278257 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7278258 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7278259 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

7278266 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7278267 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7278268 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7278269 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7278270 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7278271 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7278272 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7278273 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7278274 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7278275 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7278276 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7278277 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

7278279 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7278280 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7278281 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7278282 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7278283 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7278284 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7278285 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7278286 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7278287 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7278288 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7278289 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7278290 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7278291 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7278292 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7278293 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7278294 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7278295 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7278296 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7278297 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7278298 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7278299 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7278300 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7278301 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7278302 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7278303 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7278304 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7278305 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7278306 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7278307 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7278308 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7278309 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7278310 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7278311 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7278312 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7278313 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7278314 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7278315 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7278316 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7278317 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7278318 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7278319 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7278320 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7278321 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7278322 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7278323 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7278324 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade

7278547 continuation with the trial of comrade jacob zuma is neither in the interests of our country nor that of justice
7278548 continuation with this case will certainly and unduly raise the political temperature in our country in a manner that can negatively affect the stability of our country and democracy

7278572 the united states attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest therefore in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done as such he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer he may prosecute with earnestness and vigor indeed he should do so but while he may strike hard blows he is not a liberty to strike foul ones it is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one

7278620 if you have an infant and you dont have a life vest youre hanging on to the cushion
7278621 are they saying hang onto the cushion with one arm and your baby with another
7278622 its been something ive always wanted to have in a convention hall
7278623 the focus on foreign policy crises over the past month including the russian invasion of georgia has played to mccains perceived strengths among the electorate he holds 2 to 1 leads over obama in the new poll as the candidate with better knowledge of world affairs and the one who would make a better commander in chief he is also regarded as superior to obama in combating international terrorism and has a slender advantage on international affairs generally but on the question of who is better equipped to deal with specific foreign policy problems mccains advantages are less apparent voters rate mccain and obama evenly on handling the situation in iraq and mccain has a negligible advantage in dealing with u s relations with russia
7278624 obamas selection of biden is unlikely to shake up the race in the short term three quarters of registered voters said obamas choice of biden would not sway their votes in either direction and among those who said the selection would make a difference about as many said they were more likely to support obama with biden on the ticket as said they would be less likely to do so
7278625 back obama the highest level since she suspended her campaign in june
7278626 but outside the convention arena in denver some of hillary clintons supporters plan to air their grievances against obama the partys leadership and the national media whose coverage of the primary battle they considered sexist hundreds of disaffected democrats from around the country plan to converge in the mile high city to hold news conferences protests and vigils threatening the partys ability to present a united front against republican john mccain
7278627 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7278628 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7278629 but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7278630 when the obama crowd was miffed to learn that mccain was in a motorcade rather than in a cone of silence while obama was being questioned by rick warren nicolle wallace of the mccain camp retorted the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7278631 more pressing democrats said saturday is to review the role of superdelegates the reform commissions language includes a pledge to reduce the number of superdelegates the commission will also review caucuses which were deftly maneuvered by obama this year to counter large state victories by clinton
7278632 over the course of two months as the dynamics of the presidential campaign and world events shifted quickly mr bidens stock rose through one of the most rigorous vice presidential vetting processes that democrats could recall and it ended thursday with a phone call from mr obama who reached mr biden as he was at a dentists office where he had taken his wife to have a root canal
7278633 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7278634 obamas selection of joe biden as his running mate pleased many democrats who are concerned about obamas perceived shortcomings in foreign affairs but it worried others who fear the pick reinforces republican attacks on obamas experience and bidens past negative comments about obama will be used against the democratic ticket
7278635 if democratic presidential candidate barack obama intends to ride in and clean up the political culture of washington hes chosen a gray eminence instead of a fresh face to ride shotgun
7278636 compared with obama who is often characterized as cool and cerebral biden is direct and earthy
7278637 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7278638 its a spirit that says we are looking for different

7278662 mysticism is a dialogue in which both conversation partners are intensively at work but in which one partner god seems to be silent for all his active influence
7278663 the actors in the drama of living become stagehands costumes gorgeous but there is no play clearly by becoming practical culture reduces its one essential function and by the renunciation condemns practicality to ruin

7278702 niente a che vedere questo e unepisodio limite i turisti olandesi non uscivano da una stazione ferroviaria si sono accampati girando in bicicletta in un posto abbandonato da dio e dagli uomini dopo aver chiesto consiglio su dove mettere la tenda a un branco di pastori immigrati la loro e stata una grave imprudenza
7278703 in ogni grande citta le guide turistiche indicano le zone da evitare soprattutto nelle ore notturne ovviamente questo non esime le forze di polizia dal garantire la sicurezza a chiunque transiti anche da quelle zone ma sollecita ogni cittadino e ogni turista a dare il proprio contributo apparentemente minuscolo alla sicurezza propria e di tutti
7278704 dati che fanno paura il 73 della popolazione carceraria comunitaria e rappresentato da romeni non possiamo riempire le nostre carceri di queste persone dedite alla delinquenza dobbiamo cacciarli via senza spendere uneuro per farli restare nelle nostre carceri
7278705 lasciano sconcertati le dichiarazioni del sindaco alemanno che con una faccia tosta incredibile quasi scarica sui due poveri turisti olandesi a cui rinnoviamo la nostra solidarieta la responsabilita dellaggressione subita chieda immediatamente scusa e si vergogni
7278706 dopo una campagna elettorale avvelenata in cui la destra aveva fatto della sicurezza la bandiera oggi la realta ci dice che si trattava solo di un tragico bluff
7278707 il comportamento e le parole del sindaco di roma lasciano stupiti non solo scarica sui turisti olandesi la responsabilita di quanto accaduto ma ammette tranquillamente di non avere la capacita di controllare il territorio metropolitano
7278708 si tratta di una situazione incredibile soprattutto se si pensa ai pesantissimi tagli fatti al comparto sicurezza penalizzato dallincongruente politica del governo berlusconi
7278709 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7278710 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7278711 continues to be committed to doing whatever he can to ensure that senator obama is the next president of the united states
7278712 when we started this effort it was the only way for us to be able to vote in denver to represent the people who elected us
7278713 were proud of what we did were going to see it to the end just like our candidate we dont quit
7278714 since we never consulted with senator clintons campaign we dont know if the petition that wouldnt die had anything to do with the two joint campaign announcements made last week we will probably never know but it certainly made us feel good
7278715 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7278716 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7278717 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7278718 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said

7278728 de wedstrijd is een manier om te laten zien dat niet alleen de schoonheid bestaat die we op de televisie zien maar dat er ook een verborgener charme is

7278740 but we dont believe that the property thats being talked about is property that should be developed for housing we just dont believe its whats called recreation or business friendly nor would it throw off as much in taxes as the businesses that could go into that place
7278741 just 5 percent of anaheim but generated 50 of city revenue
7278742 if the city is waiting for a luxury hotel condo project on that site who knows how long the land will sit there vacant
7278743 you just cant build a hotel now without some kind of subsidy
7278744 the developments of which the speaker before me spoke of is one as an example where you have a quality resort component and on top you have a residential component our position has traditionally been against residential developments within the resort district but we need to look at each development and base it on its merits and within the plan and the overlays that staffs presenting we think presents a quality product that we could support especially in the outlining areas of the resort district
7278745 were giving them up to 200 000 a year to promote and work with anaheims businesses not to do referendums against the city
7278746 the chamber is supposed to be promoting businesses not pitting them against each other why should we give them one dime
7278747 we are not surprised by the 21 000 raw signatures submitted to the city today once we learned that the disney corporation was paying in excess of 10 00 per signature we believe that the reason the disney corporation chose to submit their signatures several days before the deadline was because they were aware of the steady growing numbers of anaheim residents who had requested their signatures be withdrawn from the referendum petition
7278748 conversely over the last few months over 18 000 anaheim households have shared their support for the city councils action in approving this project and concurrently voicing their disapproval of the disney corporations heavy handed tactics
7278749 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7278750 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7278751 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7278752 i hope the next pageant wont just take place online but that we can organise a real show that can take place during the miss italy contest
7278753 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7278754 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there
7278755 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team
7278756 to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7278757 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7278758 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that
7278759 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7278760 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7278761 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7278762 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7278763 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me
7278764 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday
7278765 i woke around 11am and decided to watch some tv and had some nuggets
7278766 then i slept for a couple of hours more then i got some more nuggets and came to the track
7278767 the most important thing is theyre home where theyre comfortable
7278768 track and field in the united states is not what it used to be the drug thing has scared a lot of the colleges
7278769 we have to be creative because we dont have the resources
7278770 we had a choice complain about the resources and do nothing or work with what we have
7278771 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation

7278773 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7278774 it is too much we tried to repair the car for the fans so i could race but it is too much and that is it

7278782 wat er precies gebeurde na die 2 0 kan ik moeilijk uitleggen als je het kan uitleggen zou je het moeten kunnen voorkomen of gent nu een titelkandidaat is na die 2 2 is moeilijk te zeggen we hebben nog maar twee matchen gespeeld
7278783 we begonnen heel goed aan de match maar het kan niet dat je een 2 0 voorsprong weggeeft we gingen voluit voor de winst maar na die 2 2 is het uiteraard moeilijk om terug te vechten we moesten weer helemaal opnieuw beginnen en dat is niet eenvoudig de drie punten thuishouden was de opdracht en daar zijn we jammer genoeg niet in geslaagd dit is uiteraard balen hadden we de 3 0 gescoord dan was de wedstrijd afgelopen maar het draaide anders uit

7278845 but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that which is of the heart by the spirit not by the letter
7278846 if you belong to christ then you are abrahams descendants heirs according to promise
7278847 it is not the children of the flesh who are children of god
7278848 if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity then i will remember my covenant with jacob
7278849 this means that heart circumcision not physical external jewishness is essential with god
7278850 circumcise yourselves to the lord and remove the foreskins of your heart men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem or else my wrath will go forth like fire and burn with none to quench it because of the evil of your deeds
7278851 behold the days are coming declares the lord that i will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised egypt and judah and edom and the sons of ammon and moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples for all the nations are uncircum cised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised of heart
7278852 do not boast over the jewish branches if you do boast remember it is not you that support the root the promises to abraham but the root that supports you

7278896 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7278897 just give me a minute ill get my breath back and be good to go
7278898 its system of border checkpoints to greatly expand a database on travelers entering the country by collecting information on all u s citizens crossing by land compiling data that will be stored for 15 years and may be used in criminal and intelligence investigations
7278899 which is being set up to hold personal information about all drivers in a states database
7278900 to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records
7278901 a new domestic spying measure would make it easier for state and local police to collect intelligence about americans share the sensitive data with federal agencies and retain it for at least 10 years
7278902 loosen post watergate restrictions on the fbis national security and criminal investigations
7278903 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
7278904 fbi to get freer rein to look for terrorism suspects
7278905 with a constellation of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies and others in many cases
7278906 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
7278907 cops and former secret service agents ran black ops on green groups
7278908 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
7278909 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
7278910 characterized by ambiguous lines of authority excessive secrecy troubling private sector and military participation and an apparent bent toward suspicionless information collection and data mining
7278911 to threaten resignation involved computer searches through massive electronic databases
7278912 it is not known precisely why searching the databases or data mining raised such a furious legal debate
7278913 there exists a database of americans who often for the slightest and most trivial reason are considered unfriendly and who in a time of panic might be incarcerated the database can identify and locate perceived enemies of the state almost instantaneously
7278914 riots acts of violence insurrections unlawful obstructions or assemblages and disorder prejudicial to public law and order
7278915 an emergency influx of immigrants or to support the rapid development of new programs
7278916 the more data you have on a particular target the better the software can predict what the target will do where the target will go who it will turn to for help
7278917 main core is the table of contents for all the illegal information that the u s government has compiled on specific targets
7278918 it is less a mega database than a way to search numerous other agency databases at the same time
7278919 huge volumes of records of domestic e mails and internet searches as well as bank transfers credit card transactions travel and telephone records
7278920 the nsa effort also ties into data from an ad hoc collection of so called black programs whose existence is undisclosed
7278921 many of the programs in various agencies began years before the 9 11 attacks but have since been given greater reach
7278922 to a national emergency planner everybody looks like a danger to stability
7278923 the following information seems to be fair game for collection without a warrant the e mail addresses you send to and receive from and the subject lines of those messages the phone numbers you dial the numbers that dial in to your line and the durations of the calls the internet sites you visit and the keywords in your web searches the destinations of the airline tickets you buy the amounts and locations of your atm withdrawals and the goods and services you purchase on credit cards
7278924 to accumulate otherwise private data on non targeted u s citizens for use at a future time
7278925 what was being requested of comey for legal approval was exactly what a main core story would be
7278926 comey had discovered that president bush had authorized nsa to use a highly classified and compartmentalized continuity of government database on americans in computerized searches of its domestic intercepts comey had concluded that the use of that main core database compromised the legality of the overall nsa domestic surveillance project
7278927 if a master list is being compiled it would have to be in a place where there are no legal issues
7278928 its clear that dhs has the mandate for controlling and owning master lists the process is not transparent and the criteria for getting on the list are not clear
7278929 i am certain that the content of such a master list as main core would not be carefully vetted and there would be many names on it for many reasons quite likely including the two of us
7278930 in the event of a national emergency the executive branch simply assumes these powers
7278931 when there are no criminal prosecutions and there is no notice to persons on the presidents enemies list that means if congress remains invertebrate the law will be whatever the president says it is even in secret he will be the judge on his own powers and invariably rule in his own favor
7278932 bush may have gone ahead and signed it as a national intelligence finding anyway
7278933 the capacity for future use of this information against the american people is so great as to be virtually unfathomable
7278934 professors teachers and educators labor union organizers and leaders writers lecturers newsmen and others in the mass media field lawyers doctors and scientists other potentially influential persons on a local or national level and individuals who could potentially furnish financial or material aid
7278935 can obtain millions of pieces of information on the personal lives of american citizens by tapping the data stored at any of the 96 federal relocation centers
7278936 without any set of stated rules or regulations its surveillance program remains secret even from the leaders of the house and the senate
7278937 for suspension of the constitution turning control of the united states over to fema and the appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments
7278938 i read in miami papers and several others that there had been a plan by that same agency fema that would suspend the american constitution
7278939 i was deeply concerned about that and wondered if that was the area in which he north had worked
7278940 that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area so may i request that you not touch upon that sir
7278941 using the computers in his command center north tracked dissidents and potential troublemakers within the united states compared to promis richard nixon s enemies list or senator joe mccarthy s blacklist look downright crude
7278942 how extreme were the programs they implemented after 9 11 how egregious was the lawbreaking
7278943 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
7278944 as president will you continue aggressive domestic surveillance programs in the vein of the bush administration
7278945 natural disaster epidemic or other serious public health emergency terrorist attack or incident
7278946 allows for emergency military operations in the united states without civilian supervision or control
7278947 we are at the edge of a cliff and were about to fall off
7278948 to a national emergency planner everybody looks like a danger to stability
7278949 the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny
7278950 and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government no matter how privately it was done is within the reach of the government to know
7278951 concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations
7278952 authority for use of military force to combat terrorist activities within the united states
7278953 exactly what domestic military action was covered by the october memo is unclear but federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the national security agencys terrorist surveillance program

7279073 im sure tim kaine enjoyed the attention he received as barack obamas surrogate attending rallies traveling the country going on the sunday morning talk shows and being showered in confetti at each stop
7279074 but tim kaine will not be vice president this year and he must now set aside his ambitions to focus on getting back to work as governor particularly now given the budget mess we find ourselves in likely a billion dollars in the red

7279167 wij zijn ter plaatse gegaan en hebben vastgesteld dat het bombardement erg intens was heel wat huizen zijn vernield en meer dan 90 burgers vooral vrouwen en kinderen zijn omgekomen
7279168 ze beweren dat er talibanstrijders in de buurt waren maar ze zullen dat moeten bewijzen momenteel is het niet duidelijk waarom de coalitietroepen het gebied hebben gebombardeerd
7279169 de buitenlandse soldaten stemmen hun operaties niet af op de afghaanse soldaten
7279170 intussen is het huis van tia versierd met grote spandoeken
7279171 we waren uiteraard voorbereid ik had gisteren sowieso in mijn wagen al honderd affiches liggen voor het geval tia brons zou halen honderd stuks voor als ze zilver behaalde en honderd affiches voor het goud daarom hadden de supporters zo snel een affiche in handen dinsdag krijgen alle inwoners een brief in de bus met daarbij een affiche en de vraag om die aan de deur of het raam te hangen
7279172 we vragen de medewerking van alle looienaars om het gouden koppel te feliciteren het koppel landt dinsdagochtend in zaventem mensen die een belgische driekleur in huis hebben mogen die uithangen

7279185 this is our chance to hook up see people we havent seen in four years and exchange ideas
7279186 the convention is an experience of a lifetime and to be there with my best friend my mom is such a gift
7279187 sen dole inspired me and i am hoping to meet her
7279188 i would be thrilled to meet gov huckabee he is quite a leader and i hope to shake his hand
7279189 i cant even imagine what its going to be like to be in mile high stadium watching barack obama accept the nomination in front of 75 000 people
7279190 the presidential assistant on education shall arrange for the education task force to meet foreign chambers on the job skills matching program
7279191 there should be more constructive dialogue between the schools and the private sector more flexibility in adjusting curriculums longer internships
7279192 the commission on higher education and the technical education and skills development authority shall provide more openings or places for poor students for training programs that match skills with potential jobs
7279193 assemble in north cotabato aug 23 the government has armed civilians in the fight against muslim rebels
7279194 milfs general policy is not to recruit children for combat if they are with the milf their roles are purely auxiliary in character
7279195 fully cognizant that the rightful place of children is in schools
7279196 preferable that children who are forsaken or have no reliable guardians are taken care of by the milf rather than allowed to become misfits in society
7279197 the right of everybody including children to self defense especially when communities or villages are under indiscriminate military actions by the enemy
7279198 the first priority to be closely monitored is the coastal areas for intrusion or withdrawal of enemy troops the orders are to engage if enemy is visible
7279199 we need to define their responsibilities and limitations as under executive order 546 arming them without a thorough discussion of their tasks and responsibilities might worsen up the situation in the areas of mindanao
7279200 and he knows what it means count measure and divide
7279201 the tyranny of some is possible only through the cowardice of others
7279202 our liberty will not be secured at the swords point we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it and when a people reaches that height god will provide a weapon the idols will be shattered tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn
7279203 so were nsow formalizing our market conventions to tell them that were an organized market were in the process of setting up a central trade reporting system
7279204 the system will still keep the anonymity of parties involved in the trade it will allow us to deal at the best prices
7279205 the clear language of such proclamation tasked the then committee on privatization now known as the privatization council with the duty of identifying and arranging the sale of government assets and consequently approved by the president
7279206 it bears stressing as well that in the case of petrons privatization in 1993 then president fidel v ramos gave his approval not only once but twice
7279207 barometers turned red during the week as lack of fresh incentives at home and abroad prompted players to favor trading ranges amid frail overseas participation
7279208 with majority of the second quarter earnings results already out the main drivers for the market were mostly external developments again
7279209 the surge in crude oil prices and the hostilities in mindanao dampened investors confidence and provided an excuse to take profits
7279210 we had a very quiet period in the philippine equities market last week volume was reed thin while share prices barely moved
7279211 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless
7279212 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
7279213 the proverbial light bulb went off i thought that might be fun to play with that name a little bit
7279214 i thought lets step out on a limb here and name the bank tightwad
7279215 to be really frank the customer base in reading kansas was not too excited
7279216 but the tightwad bank was too good to pass up
7279217 if you want some people to keep their distance wear a train
7279218 when i was planning my collection i saw an upscale ad of an hermes watch and it just popped in me the currant the aubergine and the platinum with diamonds just hit me my collection proves that plum and aubergine color looks good on filipina olive skin
7279219 the mood is very 1960s but i made the silhouette more today more the serpentine silhouette as opposed to a line of the 1960s but the detailing is very much from the old decade
7279220 well halle berrys piece is more embroidered mine is beaded but the feel i think you could say that that wasnt really on my mind it just happened plus the ruching of the skirt as opposed to satin used by elie saab sets them apart but it had the same feel
7279221 my favorite gown is all black with the lavender little flower if i was a woman i would wear that one its very me the lavender exists within the family of the currant and aubergine and just to pick up something just to dress up something since those gowns are all black although again my stuff is playing with texture and silhouette
7279222 honestly though the president is not that tall she is well proportioned believe it or not so any of this will look good on her of course with minor adjustments for her petite frame i would proportion it to your size it would not have to be that voluminous thats what i do i mainly do custom made for people
7279223 if it takes flair to do it ill do it
7279224 hes totally different than any other mayor of birmingham ive ever seen
7279225 most of the previous mayors have been conservative in their style like business people trying to govern a corporate entity his erratic style just doesnt fit
7279226 this city has all the potential in the world its time to do something in this town
7279227 hes a good promoter but you have to act on facts
7279228 hes doing a great job hes willing to do the things to put together a plan to move this city forward
7279229 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labour while the games were going on
7279230 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7279231 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7279232 this is our chance to hook up see people we havent seen in four years and exchange ideas

7279262 obviously im disappointed senator bayh wasnt picked because i thought he wouldve been an outstanding vice president and obviously couldve helped jill long thompson in her campaign for governor
7279263 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7279264 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7279265 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7279266 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7279267 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7279268 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7279269 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7279270 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7279271 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7279272 a free open source internet tv and video player that can automatically download videos from rss based channels
7279273 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
7279274 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
7279275 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
7279276 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
7279277 if i get punched very rarely have you seen me not hit back hard
7279278 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7279279 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7279280 if i get punched very rarely have you seen me not hit back hard
7279281 to the rest of the world hes michael phelps the american swimmer who snagged eight gold medals but for most chinese here hes maikeer feierpusi
7279282 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7279283 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7279284 john mccain and the press knows this is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years
7279285 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7279286 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7279287 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7279288 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7279323 in the tragic air strike and irresponsible and imprecise military operation in azizabad village more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7279324 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elders have died
7279325 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7279326 he approached it in a very serious sober and reasoned way
7279327 i think in his heart of hearts he thought in the end he wouldnt get it
7279328 during the vetting process you mostly hear why you wouldnt be a good candidate
7279329 i get the sense that he was quite serious about thinking through about the nature of who his partner will be there and i think the role of the vice president as a future partner in government
7279330 i think its easy to give that sort of thing short shrift
7279331 so what kind of partner im getting mattered quite a bit
7279332 ive made up my mind and were going in another direction
7279333 this is the first time stones which were used to build the temple mount walls were found
7279334 it stayed here for 2 000 years for us to find because a worker didnt know what to do with it

7279407 it is also true that in january 2008 petrosa purchased a spot cargo of reformate from mesa energy
7279408 a fact is that petrosa in good faith concluded two deals with mesa energy both deals were conducted in full compliance with petrosas internal processes which are aligned with the pfma act
7279409 this deal not only ensured that we were furthering our mandate of securing the supply of petroleum for our country but also advancing the goals of black economic empowerment
7279410 we will not pull any stops in our quest to advance this responsibility
7279411 sensationalistic headlines and baseless journalistic accusations might help sell newspapers but they can cause undue damage to the reputations of innocent companies and individuals and do not advance the cause of building and growing our democracy

7279414 although there has been a significant reduction in hake trawl mortalities since the introduction of tori lines light streamers that fly from the back of the vessel flapping in the wind to scare the birds away from the trawling cables continued efforts are required
7279415 underscores the need for international co operation on preventing seabird deaths and also reinforces the need for fishermen to implement the mandatory and readily available measures that help prevent birds from becoming entangled in fishing gear
7279416 the findings help accurately identify management measures to help reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting on other vulnerable marine life such as turtles and sharks
7279417 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our only global commons our oceans

7279470 the conflicts between human beings and elephants is growing and without a proper plan or strategy to solve or at least mitigate these problems the situation would get worse with the progress of time he said that a new policy on elephant management and conservation approved by the cabinet was now in place and it was up to the department of wild life conservation to map out a plan of action that would help the conservation of our elephants in the long term

7279494 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7279495 and so we believe the games had a good influence

7279517 in some spots in the hinterland the fleays are gone already
7279518 the biggest contributor to their decline is the chytrid fungus which has been transported around the world via toads humans use for medical research
7279519 at the moment we cant stop the fungus in the wild but there are treatments for captive frogs
7279520 over time its hoped frogs in captivity may build up a resilience to it and then be released back into the wild
7279521 in the past 20 years australia has had eight frogs become extinct six of those were in queensland

7279527 mccain some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job an education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich

7279532 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7279533 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7279534 i think at the end of the day when you look at whats facing this country the economy the war its more important than any off the cuff comment senator biden may make
7279535 youre looking at someone who doesnt need any on the job training and can fill any type of void when talking about foreign policy joe biden has respect worldwide
7279536 this is really an admission that really obama doesnt think he has enough experience to serve as president
7279537 voters in pennsylvania do not agree with joe biden on every issue but they do agree with him on the fact that barack obama is not ready to be president
7279538 i think if it were a race between senator mccain and senator biden it would be a very different race
7279539 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman who doesnt have to hide behind bluster
7279540 when he sinks his teeth into your neck he doesnt let go until you go limp
7279541 this ticket brings real hope that things will change in washington
7279542 maybe now people will begin to appreciate what biden has been trying to do
7279543 hillary supporters are a little uneasy but i think they will come around
7279544 most people dont even know we have a state treasurer you run for this position because you feel you can do something for the people of this commonwealth
7279545 im not one of these business leaders who never tasted economic insecurity i have a sense of what that can look and feel like and thats helping to shape this race for me
7279546 we can do this very efficiently and at the same time we can help to ensure that pensioners are not hurt by anti terrorism investment policies
7279547 im very much someone who believes we are all somewhat social investors no one wants to invest in companies with bad practices
7279548 when you really look at the treasurers office its really important
7279549 is basically the chief financial officer for the state of pennsylvania with a multi billion dollar budget annually that has to be managed
7279550 in a state as large as pennsylvania with a budget as large as pennsylvanias over 28 billion having someone whos qualified and capable in that office is important
7279551 i think for most treasurers the odds are with them running again but im not someone who needs to hold public office thats not what ive organized my life around
7279552 i think you go serve your time in government and then go back to the private world
7279553 id like to do eight years as treasurer and go back and practice law some more

7279591 en todas las parejas que investigan la felicidad amorosa hay un reparto de funciones que no depende del sexo respectivo al principio por ejemplo pero las variables son infinitas ella es buena d cil no sabe ganar dinero es lista fr gil cari osa y fiel en tanto que l es col rico independiente eficaz inteligente protector e infiel es un esquema vulgar pero frecuente pues bien sea cual sea el reparto de funciones a lo largo de una investigaci n amorosa todas las funciones se truecan si es que estamos hablando de una investigaci n seria porque se trata de un fen meno de mutuo espejismo y cada uno de los objetos quiere ser el otro y lo consiguen conseguirlo quiere decir dos cosas primero aburrirse del otro por lo mucho que se parece a lo que uno era antes segundo comprender lo mediocre y zafio que era uno entonces el otro es ahora mediocre y zafio la felicidad amorosa llegados a este punto aparece en su verdadera verdad como un intento de comprensi n filos fica que no ha utilizado el m todo adecuado ya que lo que se trata de comprender es nada menos que ese concepto vac o el tiempo o su met fora m s habitual la muerte y para alcanzar a comprenderlo es preciso utilizar otros m todos como luego se ver y por qu siendo siempre as pervive el mecanismo amoroso en las sociedades industriales complicando tant simo las vidas de las personas porque siempre es una experiencia singular la nica que parece de uno mismo y s lo de uno mismo ya que todas las restantes experiencias de investigaci n a partir de sta ya que no son singulares sino universales en la investigaci n amorosa los individuos se mantienen como individuos con su pelo sus ojos sus huellas dactilares que les hacen irrepetibles y no pueden dejar de ser individuos pero una vez dilucidado el contenido de la felicidad amorosa las b squedas subsiguientes si la primera ha sido llevado a cabo hasta las ltimas consecuencias ya no podran ser de ning n individuo porque necesariamente se habr superado el umbral dela huella dactilar y de lo singular y se habr penetrado en el neutro silencioso quieto mundo de lo general y de lo universal en el que nada tiene nombre propio ni mucho menos pesta as esta caracter stica de singularidad hace que toda investigaci n amorosa le parezca a uno muy personal irrepetible y llena de originalidades que vistas desde fuera son aplastantemente vulgares y sorpresas s lo para quien las sufre pus los dem s las ven venir de lejos en definitiva toda investigaci n amorosa puede contarse como si fuera unica cuando en realidad es de una ordinariez que hace girar la cara
7279592 the american people do not want government to solve all our problems
7279593 provide immediate relief to working people who have lost their jobs families who have lost their homes and people who have lost their way
7279594 every american is empowered to be a watchdog and a whistle blower
7279595 every senior deserves to live out their life with dignity and respect
7279596 will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
7279597 develop innovative transitional job programs that place unemployed people into temporary jobs and train them for permanent ones
7279598 we know we cant drill our way to energy independence
7279599 provide every child access to quality affordable early childhood education
7279600 we wont increase taxes on any family earning under 250 000 and we will offer additional tax cuts for middle class families
7279601 by dedicating a portion of the revenues generated by an economy wide cap and trade program
7279602 ah si quer s que te cuente de n stor
7279603 i think its exceedingly important that we dont look at the success here as a moment in time
7279604 because if we dont carry on from what we accomplished here and build we will have done a disservice to olympians in the future
7279605 we are playing with the big boys when we come to the olympics especially the summer olympics and the 205 countries that are here
7279606 weve gotten a little better but were going to need more money if we are going to make that climb
7279607 i go through these emotionally i am a canadian too
7279608 my heart broke for marie helene premont who didnt finish at the bike and you cant imagine what we felt for adam in his first race knowing the intensity he brings to what he does
7279609 there were many of those moments but there were many of the eric lamaze gold and silver in equestrian moments and alex despatie who won silver
7279610 im no longer saying fourth we almost had a medal
7279611 im saying silver what could we have done to have the gold if you start thinking that way it pulls the system up
7279612 actually it grazed off my nose before it hit my bicep i have a rather large nose i was laughing about it on the way in
7279613 i guess everybodys saying its a totally new me or whatever
7279614 but im the same person i was before i went down i just added a four seam fastball
7279615 you let him get settled down its going to be a long day
7279616 he roitman has got a lot of experience and all the argentinian guys are tough players
7279617 ive got to make sure im ready at the start of the match
7279618 i think against guys that prefer clay its important to attack
7279619 clay and grass and hard courts are so different clay court experts are used to playing a long way behind the baseline
7279620 on the hard court if you can get the ball quickly and rush them they dont like to as much you have to try to get some free points off the serve
7279621 i was lying around a lot tossing and turning which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that but i didnt know what else to do
7279622 i mustve had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either
7279623 there was a lot of doubt in my mind its not something im used to i dont know how to cope i tried to read but i wasnt very interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say and thats odd
7279624 the one he wrote posthumously uh uh oh yeah armageddon in retrospect
7279625 mostly because of the stress and pressure ive been dealing with the last 24 hours
7279626 i talked to my mom friday night and she said the one thing you dont have any practice at is dealing with this stuff
7279627 but after i got out of bed friday i wrote down things that i wanted to be
7279628 but the last 100 was just a huge struggle i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it
7279629 i looked at the scoreboard and it came up australia first
7279630 then great britain second and i thought if i dont see my name third up there im just going to try and disappear
7279631 that it was going to come down to the last 50 metres
7279632 winning this gold medal its one of those things you dreamed about for so long and now its here its happened what a feeling

7279637 f re detta riksdagsledamoten anne marie ekstr m fp skriver p sin
7279638 to carry out the concept of the peoples olympics we were people oriented in designing and building venues we also advocated civilized behavior among citizens organized olympic related cultural activities in schools and to absorb volunteers from all walks of life
7279639 the chinese people teeming with enthusiasm have honored the commitments they solemnly made
7279640 the beijing 2008 olympic games is a grand celebration of sport a grand celebration of peace and a grand celebration of friendship
7279641 china has always opened its door to the outside world
7279642 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7279643 this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit pissed off
7279644 when that dreadful day comes the audience will be ready for it
7279645 the reason the finale of the last series worked so well is that it was top secret
7279646 it s a free country and people are entitled to say this is richard and judy going off into the dim antechamber of television but i would ask them whats the future digital or analogue of course we are going to get smaller audiences but this is the challenge of the moment
7279647 most people are desperate to be famous and would do anything
7279648 it appeals to the mentality of people who stop to watch after an accident
7279649 the wonderful thing about the olympics is seeing people become famous because they have talent what a lovely change
7279650 it is more fulfilling of course because it concerns talent the beatles didnt make it because of me but because of the songs they wrote
7279651 we have had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7279652 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked
7279653 we work very closely with german tv and the german book publisher and we love all germans
7279654 i was driven to tell a certain kind of story about global consciousness and interconnectivity i asked can people with these powers find each other defeat evil and save the world it was important to have people in the show that werent just blonde haired blue eyed californians
7279655 our relationship with our audience is tenuous but they are passionate intense involved and yes obsessive
7279656 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7279657 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7279658 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7279659 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7279660 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7279661 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7279662 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7279663 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7279664 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7279665 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7279666 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7279667 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7279668 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7279669 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7279670 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7279671 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7279672 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7279673 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7279674 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7279675 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7279676 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7279677 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7279678 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7279679 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7279680 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7279681 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7279682 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7279683 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7279684 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7279685 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7279686 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7279687 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7279688 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7279689 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7279690 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7279691 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7279692 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7279693 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7279694 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7279695 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7279696 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7279697 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7279698 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7279699 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7279700 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7279701 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7279702 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7279703 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7279704 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7279705 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7279706 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7279707 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7279708 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7279709 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7279710 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7279711 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7279712 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7279713 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7279714 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7279715 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7279716 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7279717 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7279718 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7279719 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7279720 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7279726 we knew we had done it we had finally won at the olympic games that joy defies description
7279727 it was a strange moment after losing the game we had to put it in perspective and think we really didnt lose the gold medal we won the silver

7279733 speaking about sri krishna is like introducing one to ones self
7279734 we can become like sri krishna we can become like kamsa
7279735 we can become like rama we can also become like ravana
7279736 it is a continuous flow of experience we can transform our lives into an experience of spreading happiness to one and all sri krishnas life was the perfect example of this if all our infinite innate auspicious qualities were to take the form of a human being the beautiful result would be lord krishna he expressed the infinite power inherent in humankind to its fullness it is for this reason that he is glorified as the purnavatar the complete incarnation of god sri krishna was both ordinary and extraordinary at the same time he was human and yet not human he was complete in all ways
7279737 we need to transcend logic and firmly establish ourselves in innocent love and faith we need to look at life through such eyes then all experiences will become blissful like amrita nectar that is the message of lord krishnas life sri krishnas words and actions demonstrated the different facets of life the secrets of para dharma and apara dharma 4 and the subtleties of action inaction and enlightened action to understand sri krishnas message we need unwavering love devotion and faith

7279803 the pakistan cricket board pcb have been extremely reasonable about the whole subject it has been very clear they have worked jolly hard to try to give comfort to the member boards and the eight teams that are touring that it would be safe and secure

7279810 whats the point of being nervous its done and gone its not like a stage performance where i can improve on the performance mumbai meri jaan and maan gaye mughal e azam are very different films am i proud of both films im happy with both films i was even proud of a few of my three scenes in shaurya
7279811 i got to do comedy again in maan gaye mughal e azam this is an entirely new genre for me the director sanjay chhel comes from gujarati theatre i play a ghazal singer haldi hassan with a roving eye slightly sleazy and though i sing quite well i left it to the professional playback singers to sing for me im only an actor
7279812 but genres are not relevant i leave it to the pundits to segregate by genre i go by what the script requires from me for me acting is cathartic it gives me a chance to be and do what i wouldnt in real life we actors are a blessed lot acting gives me a chance to recognise myself
7279813 i play an unemployed guy he can apply himself to work but chooses not to and hangs around with younger boys in an irani caf its all very interestingly done
7279814 i used to joke about me being a garlanded photograph in
7279815 sarkar was one of my most popular films im quite happy with the work i do im getting to live my life the way i do
7279816 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
7279817 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
7279818 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
7279819 its hard to see how that one will unfold but at present i think the situation with the company is still unravelling
7279820 however i dont believe that there is a culture which is sufficiently robust to prevent it re happening so therefore there has got to be some remedial action
7279821 the management and the ceo run the business were the ones who are accountable for the bank
7279822 its a question of do you want 20 years of protracted litigation and reputational issues or do you want to come to something which is a bit more convenient its a balance
7279823 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy
7279824 this will underpin the rio share price and also create uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7279825 even if chinalco doesnt increase its stake it shows they have the capacity to block the deal
7279826 it could do a soft deal with bhp and vote for the merger in return for securing the assets
7279827 clearly its a worry that weve got specific job losses occurring in certain companies but that of course is part and parcel of overall economic activity
7279828 i think its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what you have to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is in reasonably good shape
7279829 we did an examination of those suppliers and 46 of the 200 have a turnover under 50 million
7279830 we are at a point where we have to act and act quickly on tariffs
7279831 baby boomers are not saving up for their kids inheritance they love the good things in life and shopping could be seen as a means of establishing their self identity
7279832 didnt thoroughly prepare or research the australian market and now theyre paying the price
7279833 and believe me if youve worked with tattersalls you know what professional is
7279834 australians dont like complicated lottery games theyre used to buying tickets for games offered by tatts like quick picks and powerball that are all over in five seconds
7279835 theyre not into drawing lucky lines or complex bingo games where you have snowballs in the middle and all the rest of it
7279836 intralot just didnt do the work to find out the australian mentality
7279837 sales are trending upwards as retailers and consumers become more familiar with the games and intralot is confident that it will achieve its forecasts
7279838 not everthing is fixed but overall its far better than it was
7279839 i think wed all have to acknowledge that when you have something new in a business venture its going take some time
7279840 tatts used to make more than 1 billion a year in lottery sales and the government took home 36 cents in every dollar
7279841 the president shall be commander in chief of the united states armed forces
7279842 i dont want you to feel sorry for me or anything
7279843 melbournes median house price rose 10 8 per cent in the year to june
7279844 median priced houses have been selling whilst property in the lower half of the market have been stagnating with few vendors able to move their overvalued property
7279845 its probably the toughest question of all at the moment
7279846 we are at a very interesting juncture because chinese demand is proving to be more cyclical than most people expected
7279847 if china can arrest the slide in its industrial production by the first quarter of next year we may see a reversal of the swoon we are seeing now at the moment
7279848 if you are a super cyclist there are some very good buying opportunities out there if you are more circumspect you may want to sit it out until the story with china becomes clearer next year
7279849 i think we could see a strong rally in the last three months of this year as china increases production again after the olympics
7279850 the market which has become very short term focused will extend its focus back to the longer term
7279851 the amount of investors placing bets that the oil price will fall in the past two months has soared
7279852 the outlook for the united states and western europe remains bleak but the outlook for china is far less certain
7279853 for five years commodities prices have risen across the board but we are starting to see much more widespread variation in the last year or so
7279854 this means you have to be a bit more selective in the commodities bets you place
7279855 has grown quietly for years both in commercial applications and in consumer devices
7279856 give every child access to high quality pre kindergarten programs
7279857 go long and ill find you a couple times a game
7279858 is there talent to replace curtis lofton and reggie smith
7279859 if tech gains 2 yards on this play they win the game lets give it to that guy
7279860 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7279861 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7279862 mentre lui ti da qualche dettaglio e la tua fantasia corre facendosi gi un quadro
7279863 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno che stringono facendo scivolare lacrime
7279864 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7279865 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno

7279870 we will make a political decision in due course on where we go beyond 400
7279871 on the basis of the results and the demand the only issue is how far
7279872 we have 100 opening in 2010 there will be very strong pressure from parents and local authorities to maintain that rate
7279873 my motto as an ardent blairite is in the masters words what matters is what works
7279874 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7279875 i tried 100 per cent he got the lead a silly lead at the start of it i was still asleep
7279876 im disgusted with myself for that thats my only regret in the whole competition the first round but i gave it everything i had in the last three
7279877 i had that in the back of my head but i didnt let it affect my game i just threw everything i had
7279878 he caught me with a couple of good shots i caught him body shots as well that probably didnt score
7279879 but im not going to start making excuses ive had a great campaign i want to thank all the supporters here and at home thats it thats the end of the fairytale for now
7279880 im happy im very very happy it would have been nice to take the gold its always the same when you win something you want more
7279881 he boxed well himself he had a hard draw himself he done well and beat the russian and kazakh you cant take it away from him he done it there tonight

7279883 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7279884 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7279885 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7279886 i hope the next pageant wont just take place online but that we can organise a real show that can take place during the miss italy contest
7279887 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
7279888 this is incredible and im even more grateful that its in high definition
7279889 but its mindbogglingly difficult and that extra inch makes a big difference it could save someone from having to bend their knees throughout a long haul flight
7279890 our job is to look at everything in the cabin all of the thousands of little details most of which the passengers will never notice and to make sure that theyre intelligently designed

7279896 on my first trip i had summarized turkey as a peasant economy with colorful ruins
7279897 a supine and beleaguered country of people narcissistic about their differences

7279903 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7279904 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7279905 it was hot but to run 2 06 32 in this is incredible i think that just shows hes a very young guy and hes going to be an incredible marathoner
7279906 mentally its tough to convince yourself that its possible for those guys to come back
7279907 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there
7279908 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team
7279909 to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7279910 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7279911 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that
7279912 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7279913 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7279914 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7279915 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7279916 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me
7279917 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday

7279944 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7279945 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7279946 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7279947 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7279948 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7279949 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7279950 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7279975 toen ik in de wachtkamer zat te wachten tot ik het stadion in mocht was ik een beetje aan het terugdenken ik besefte toen eigenlijk pas wat er de afgelopen dagen allemaal gebeurd is ik ben normaal niet zo emotioneel maar daar in die wachtkamer was ik het wel een beetje het raakte me wel dat ik daar als vlaggendrager zat ik ben echt trots dat het me hier gelukt is dat ik gewonnen heb wordt nu steeds normaler
7279976 het maakte het wel extra bijzonder dat ik door heel veel mensen gekozen ben
7279977 het was echt heel leuk om te doen het is toch wel heel mooi dat ik na al die mooie prestaties van de ploeg nederland mocht vertegenwoordigen
7279978 het was een leuke show ik had dit nog nooit meegemaakt maar het geeft wel een gevoel van saamhorigheid om zo bij elkaar te zijn daar gaat het bij de spelen toch ook om

7279993 get into the habit of dealing with god about everything unless you learn to open the door of your life completely and let god in from your first waking moment of each new day you will be working on the wrong level throughout the day but if you will swing the door of your life fully open and pray to your father who is in the secret place every public thing in your life will be marked with the lasting imprint of the presence of god
7279994 the american status symbol that you could never afford until now

7279996 across racial and religious boundaries iraqi politicians on saturday bemoaned democratic presidential contender barack obamas choice of running mate known in iraq as the author of a 2006 plan to divide the country into ethnic and sectarian enclaves
7279997 anyway it is a reflection of the diminishing political significance of the iraq war that barack obama who secured the democratic nomination in part by making much of his opposition to the war and his plan to withdraw our troops on a fast schedule is now able to pick as his running mate a senator who voted for the invasion in 2002 and whose favored solution would have required more rather than less american involvement in iraqi domestic politics
7279998 the russians are digging entrenchments and a checkpoint to the entrance
7279999 it never seems to matter that john mccain is the wealthier candidate and represents economic interests that are in many ways aristocratic its always barack obama who is the elitist
