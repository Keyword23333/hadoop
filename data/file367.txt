3670069 as always artists with a vision for an arts related project are encouraged to apply even if its not in the literary arts our designated themes will give a small advantage to related applications but the quality of artistic experience still remains the most important factor in reviewing applications
3670070 all children are artists the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up adults have a set idea of what things should look like but kids dont
3670071 the majority of our society has decided what is fine art what is good and who has talent the most rewarding thing for me is reversing or preemptively striking out the adverse effects of the notion of talent or good in art
3670072 my biggest joy is fostering confidence in the unwavering knowledge that the best art comes from each childs own head and heart that what makes their art great is how it is different from everyone elses
3670073 too many people grow up believing that realism is the best art and only a few achieve it and those who do are the talented
3670074 the truth is that all of us have it it is simply up to us what we do with it i mean we could drive a racecar fix a sink or become celebrated composers if we wanted it comes down to desire and practice
3670075 all of the students are excited about what theyve created and the way theyve expressed themselves i can see a light in their eyes
3670076 the preschoolers are more animated jumping up and down they want you to share in their success the older kids have a quiet pride i can see them sit up straighter and i can tell that they are more confident
3670077 i think i was drawing as soon as i could hold a crayon and i remember the feeling of a paintbrush in my hand in kindergarten we didnt have an elementary art teacher
3670078 but my classroom teacher had an easel and paints set up and we were able to paint freely i went to that station as often as possible
3670079 in the years after i mostly drew at home and did not take another art class until 8th grade that year i sold my first painting a watercolor and i think that was an incentive to continue challenging myself
3670080 i painted my first oil portrait that summer at performing and visual arts northwest which is a program similar to jmus summer art workshops but for older students there has really been no stasis between then and now there have been periods of rest but ive had steady growth
3670081 in my painting i far prefer oils to any other medium there is give and play and transparency and depth however it can be a tricky material
3670082 for someone starting out i would suggest beginning with water based paints like acrylic or watercolor although i think watercolor is the hardest but really i think if someone wants to paint they could pick up anything and start experimenting and theyll be fine personal experience and trial and error is the best teacher
3670083 my first oil painted portrait was basically focused on technique and spatial reasoning it was almost mathematical in some way
3670084 i did not use a grid to map out ratios but i felt like there was this right answer and my job was to reach it that excited me success was achievable in some way at this point i know i can recreate the dimensions of a human face and form the excitement lies in bringing the person to life capturing something present in a moment
3670085 captures an essence unique to her perspective of the individual being painted
3670086 i only painted people i knew and experienced in my daily downtown travels it was wonderful to paint each stroke
3670087 i think about it sit on it for a long time before i begin the 12 30 hour painting process
3670088 i typically like to work in long extended stretches so books on tape are delightful i become engaged in a storyline and my hands do the rest i start with an under painting of umbers and after that dries slightly move on to paint the entire portrait again in color because oil paint is transparent this provides a rich undertone and creates depth
3670089 she asked me to paint this particular picture of her on her wedding day i was 14 years old and i was incredibly intimidated i knew her far too well any flaw would be so obvious it was two years before i gave in and painted it i was painstakingly tedious
3670090 i realized that i could communicate with children well and could understand what they need i think its innate it seems intuitive
3670091 generally i would like to see more more more specifically i want to expand larkin art studios and create an art center in harrisonburg i would love to see something that would service artists students and the general public
3670092 we need more galleries studios and places for classes a larger variety of media would be great we dont have any installation pieces in harrisonburg
3670093 we need people who are inspiring each other we have special things throughout the year but to have arts related things day to day is important

3670108 a big problem for the system integrator community is having different set of tools built on multiple platforms

3670111 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3670112 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3670113 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3670114 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3670115 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3670116 a truly spectacular book the wealth of information this attractively illustrated book presents will make it a valued reference

3670120 this comprehensive work is a definitive account of the most diverse and least appreciated and understood groups of animals
3670121 the editors have recruited an impressive team of international experts an invaluable work of reference
3670122 more than 250 individual articles are clearly and concisely written a must for all biological libraries and individual biologists

3670203 there was another team who called right around when the white sox did and that team was ready to pay jordan second round money the white sox knew this and we talked about it
3670204 im just not going to put jordan on a bus because the white sox throw out a number
3670205 we can send him to a first class university with a first class facility
3670206 lamarr has played really physical this camp thats what ive been most pleased with
3670207 its very difficult the hardest place to play is when youve got to move closer to the ball because it happens a lot faster with the bigger bodies in there
3670208 hes done a great job transitioning from end to tackle i was telling him today ive been real proud of his effort and what hes been doing as physical as hes been playing
3670209 hes in great shape hes done everything right hes worked really really hard
3670210 brian has been really good for sam telling him no youve got to be better
3670211 this senior class has been a lot better about coaching the younger ones than our previous two senior classes were we think its bringing some of those young guys along better
3670212 hes got a live leg that ball gets so high when he kicks it
3670213 the other thing is hes punting really well hell be in the mix with trevor gerland and jon gold for those duties
3670214 in order to be a great defense you have to deliver a blow up front run to the ball and tackle thats what weve been doing
3670215 if one day you wake up and youre tired and dont feel like doing it then youre just a soft person its that type of mentality that i really see rubbing off on guys

3670234 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3670235 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3670236 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3670237 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3670238 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3670239 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3670240 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3670241 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3670242 the conditions are ripe for either a near landslide maybe 53 percent or a landslide
3670243 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old
3670244 you have to be clearheaded about that kind of regime
3670245 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
3670246 speaking directly to the russians as opposed to in some pugnacious cold war fashion is what this modern challenge needs
3670247 what russia needs to know is that it will be globally ostracized and s global approach is different from the state to state balance of power approach that is visible in the mccain talking points
3670248 he was a reaganite in the cold war that was a pro democracy anti communist approach
3670249 he was certainly supportive of yeltsin from the early 90s through the mid 90s
3670250 we should make clear to russia that we appreciate the importance of russian stability to our own security
3670251 but we should make equally clear to russia that we are free to pursue all opportunities for enhancing our security and that of our allies
3670252 w e must make abundantly clear to moscow that we consider this action to be evidence that russia cannot yet be trusted as good faith partners in preserving european stability
3670253 when putin emerged as this highly capable strongman with kgb networks i suspect that turned mccain off

3670264 they held hands and looked eye to eye with him still wearing sunglasses during the ceremony
3670265 they looked very happy together i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3670266 they didnt bring any friends as witnesses so the photographer had to stand in
3670267 i asked them each if they agreed to love and cherish each other and they said i do it was over in 15 minutes the bride changed out of her wedding dress right away then they left the groom wasnt dressed up at all

3670326 we have had numerous flooding calls throughout central fife from north to south for most of the evening and early morning

3670329 het aantal vermeldingen op de longlists van de gouden uil van een bepaalde referteperiode
3670330 voor een uitgever is dat gewoon onmogelijk dit houdt in dat wij auteurs moeten verwittigen dat wij ze niet zullen selecteren als er in het verleden te veel titels werden ingestuurd dan komt dat wellicht omdat uitgeverijen de criteria te ruim inschatten dan moeten de organisatoren heel duidelijk zeggen wat mag en niet mag en de uitgeverijen daarvan tijdig op de hoogte brengen met de nieuwe regel bestaat het gevaar dat uitgeverijen alleen nog maar titels of auteurs insturen die het meeste kans maken ook vreemd dat ze ons hiervan op de hoogte brengen in volle vakantietijd
3670331 als ik het goed begrijp mag ik maar vijf titels insturen
3670332 ik kan me inbeelden dat zij vooral telegenieke winnaars willen zoals arnon grunberg of tom lanoye auteurs waarover ze iets kunnen maken en die goed verkopen geen onbekende zoals marc reugebrink
3670333 als dat te veel is voor de jury waarom maken we van de abn amro prijs voor non fictie geen tweede grote prijs dan hebben we de gouden uil voor fictie en n voor non fictie
3670334 de vooral uit literair ge nteresseerden bestaande jury van de gouden uil heeft zo blijkt uit nominaties en bekroningen weinig affiniteit met de non fictie voorts is het nog de vraag of fictie en non fictie wel voldoende vergelijkbaar zijn om ze tegen elkaar te kunnen afwegen in alle geval kreeg de non fictie zeker bij de gouden uil nooit een faire kans het probleem is niet nieuw aanvankelijk kwam voor de gouden uil ook po zie in aanmerking en was er nog een aparte gouden uil voor non fictie maar de uil loosde de po zie voegde de twee prijzen samen en cre erde daarnaast een publieksprijs dat had te maken met commerci le afwegingen van de hoofdsponsor de standaard boekhandel want de toenmalige non fictieprijs leverde geregeld nominaties op voor boeken die de boekhandel nooit eerder in huis had gehaald omdat hij die onverkoopbaar achtte terwijl ze na een bekroning soms al evenmin bestsellers werden een publieksprijs rendeert daarentegen heel wat beter de winnaar is per definitie al populair dan kan de gouden uil maar beter rechtlijnig zijn en de hele non fictie uit zijn bekroning schrappen dat vermindert de werklast van de jury al meteen met de helft
3670335 een uitgever moet al zijn auteurs zo goed mogelijk steunen die kan geen ranking aanbrengen misschien is de gouden uil het slachtoffer van zijn eigen succes

3670374 om mensen zo op te lichten ikzelf had drie iphones besteld helaas
3670375 zij vertellen dat het bedrijf werd geteisterd door boze klanten de medewerkers zijn niet verantwoordelijk want die telefoontjeshandel deed hij alleen maar ze merkten wel dat het allemaal niet soepel ging de eigenaar had telkens een ander smoesje waarom de toestellen niet werden geleverd
3670376 vorige week zaterdag heeft hij zijn onderkomens leeggehaald die zondag erna heeft hij waarschijnlijk een vliegtuig genomen vanaf schiphol we hebben nog gekeken of we ergens beslag op konden leggen maar hij blijkt geen koopwoning maar een huurwoning te hebben gehad vermoedelijk is hij naar rusland vertrokken waar zijn vriendin een adres heeft en anders ligt hij op een strand in brazili zijn favoriete vakantieland
3670377 hij gaf regelmatig opdrachten voor banktransacties en kasopnames er was in elk geval druk bankverkeer
3670378 wij adviseren iedereen aangifte te doen en contact op te nemen met de bank of creditcardmaatschappij waarbij de betaling is geschied misschien kunnen gedupeerden nog iets terugkrijgen
3670379 er zijn klanten bij die zestien telefoons hadden besteld n betaald die zitten met een strop van zon elfduizend euro
3670380 na een week stond op zijn website dat er wat vertragingen waren ontstaan als vergoeding zou je een auto oplader erbij krijgen en ook een iphone hoesje pas w ken later was er weer een melding dat er een nieuwe lading iphones aankwam maar sinds afgelopen donderdag is de website offline
3670381 ik heb me helemaal suf gebeld en gemaild naar dit bedrijf maar nooit meer iets gehoord ik had hier hard voor gewerkt ik heb zelfs mijn vakantie ervoor opgegeven omdat ik zo graag die iphone wilde hebben ik hoop maar dat die vent wordt gepakt
3670382 als van z opgespoord en schuldig bevonden wordt zal hij de komende twintig jaar die claim aan zijn broek hebben
3670383 verwacht er maar niet te veel van volgens mij is het einde oefening en moet je je verlies accepteren mocht er toch iets terugkomen is dat mooi meegenomen maar hij heeft waarschijnlijk alles al uitgeven
3670384 wij hebben gisteren aangifte gedaan mijn broer zwager schoonzus en ik hebben er eentje besteld ik hoorde van iemand dat hij misschien in brazili zit omdat dat zijn droom was dat gaat hem vast lukken met ons geld iedereen moet aangifte doen zodat de politie hem gaat opsporen hoe meer aangiftes hoe beter
3670385 the instrumental ambience of the album is lavishing gorgeous and inexplicably german and the melodies ah the melodies the track der groove des guten gewissens with its dramatic strings and high octave piano notes is a true cinematic experience turn that up and walk around the city in the rain and let me know if your eyes dont swell up with tears
3670386 wij willen dat de problemen zo snel mogelijk worden opgelost
3670387 ik moet het al een half jaar met vijfhonderd per maand minder doen omdat ik de kinderopvang moet voorschieten
3670388 als die situatie nog lang duurt moet ik gaan lenen en over die lening moet ik dan weer rente betalen
3670389 er zijn honderden nieuwe meldingen van gezinnen die dit soort extra kosten maken de belastingdienst zegt dat het om uitzonderingen gaat maar die ouders verkeren wel in de meest nijpende situaties
3670390 het zou voor de hand liggen dat de fiscus ook die kosten vergoedt er is al eens gesproken over het aftrekbaar maken van leningen voor kinderopvang maar dat lost het probleem maar voor een deel op ouders moeten ook extra kosten maken bijvoorbeeld voor rente die kosten moeten honderd procent terugkomen in hun portemonnee
3670391 ik begrijp dat het tijd kost om lastige problemen op te lossen
3670392 maar het is niet onze schuld dat het zo lang duurt daarom is het ook niet terecht dat wij wel voor de kosten opdraaien
3670393 dat hangt af van de voorbeelden waar boink mee komt maar in principe vergoeden wij geen kosten in een enkel geval kan een uitzondering worden gemaakt

3670403 in japan kunnen die vissen in vier vijf jaar wel zo groot worden maar hier lukt je dat niet
3670404 als ze vijftien centimeter groot zijn kosten ze misschien een tientje maar als ze in een jaar tijd nog eens vijftien centimeter groeien zijn ze al gauw dertig veertig of misschien wel vijftig euro waard
3670405 als het een beetje mooie vis is trouwens zelfs lelijke vissen brengen tegenwoordig geld op vroeger gooiden ze in japan 80 weg tegenwoordig wordt er n ks meer weggegooid
3670406 bij al die exotische beleggingen heb je grote kans dat je je geld kwijt bent
3670407 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent
3670408 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3670409 it was a little too hard for me to get out of that funk
3670410 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3670411 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3670412 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3670413 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3670414 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope
3670415 in china well have more people coming into gymnasiums and we will be stronger in the future

3670417 the groups melodies are refined the songs are bursting at the seams with ideas the craftsmanship is impressive and most importantly their combined offerings are outstanding name our numbers numbers is evidence of an accomplished band and this ep is everyones chance to jump on before the bandwagon is gassed cleaned and speeding down the indie superhighway

3670419 im sure a lot of belgians feel it is unfair the champions of a country have to play a qualifying round to get into the champions league
3670420 im sure people in belgium were hoping that once you win your championship that you would automatically qualify for the champions league like some other countries do such as england germany spain and so on
3670421 it is going to be a very difficult two matches to qualify for the next stage of the champions league
3670422 people here in belgium were probably hoping for a more favourable draw but we are still relishing the opportunity to play against liverpool
3670423 we definitely respect liverpool they are a great and huge club they have a great history especially in terms of the champions league so we will have our work cut out for us
3670424 hopefully we will be able to rise to the occasion in the two matches that lay ahead there is always belief
3670425 im sure that the people of liverpool are probably happy with the draw and hopefully we can use that to our advantage
3670426 you never know in football we have a lot of good players here
3670427 obviously the belgian league is not as respected as the premier league but i feel that we have quality players that can possibly make a difference on any given day
3670428 any win against liverpool is going to be a big win but for me it was so because it was my first start at home and first win with them
3670429 it will always stay a big souvenir for me in terms of my newcastle experience but that is in the past and i tend not to dwell on the past too much and try to concentrate on the future
3670430 a lot has changed at liverpool a lot of different players have come into that team
3670431 fernando torres is a great player and i had the opportunity to play against him this summer when the us played against spain
3670432 it was 1 0 to spain torres played the first half and at the end of that it was 0 0
3670433 personally i think i defended pretty well against him although he was also coming off an injury so he probably wasnt at 100
3670434 he has a lot of different tricks in his arsenal and you have to be on your toes at all times and concentrate
3670435 but there is not just one player that we have to be aware of it is the whole squad
3670436 ive always said that my ambitions are to leave belgium for a bigger league if that be england then that would be great
3670437 ive matured a lot and progressed in a lot of different factors and aspects of my game since 2007
3670438 i feel as though i had a short stint in order to adapt to the style of the premier league
3670439 sometimes it takes players six to eight months to get used to the premier league style
3670440 i feel as though i didnt have adequate time to really showcase what i am capable of doing perhaps next time around ill get that opportunity

3670444 last month i raved about the slow beings single choice from this album i waste the sea we know why the earth moves s opening track still is a nice song but is now stretched out into a 6 minute piece twice its single edit length its a cool opener the neatly titled we know why the earth moves holds 10 songs of sparkling indie pop rock magnificent and grand yet down to earth in sound and attitude a fine combination of tip toe and slack yoshkar ola song people leave heaven carson dyle the happy few and the title track are among many fine moments from a strong debut

3670447 what an odd denial who accused young of funneling campaign funds to support rielle in the first place i wonder if any member of our crack mainstream media will bother to check into this interesting thread
3670448 which political candidate enjoys visiting new york because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown the pol tells her hell marry her when his current wife is out of the picture
3670449 before he was running for president john edwards made a series of awesome short documetaries sic that later vanished from the internet until now
3670450 interesting bit of trivia did you know trippi also worked for the gary hart campaign as deputy political director after hart got busted with donna rice he became chief of staff to harts wife now hes out defending elizabeth edwards
3670451 not lost in the matter is the irony of edwards stance after all the videos were made with the apparent goal of bringing transparency to the political process
3670452 its ironic that the edwards campaign webisodes made by rielle hunter initially produced to bring the campaign publicity made their biggest splash when the campaign attempted to hide them
3670453 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
3670454 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3670455 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk

3670459 edwards looked like a deer in the headlights and was very careful about how he parsed his words he even stopped himself mid denial and reverted to his stock answer
3670460 at least three dozen daily newspapers in the united states published the craig news the day after the roll call scoop on sen larry craigs foot tapping troubles in a minnesota mens room stall according to nexis but this morning not a single u s daily mentioned the enquirer piece
3670461 if there are pictures why doesnt national enquirer release them as well
3670462 if you havent yet checked out iretsu then this is your chance to hop on the bandwagon before this portland based trio really take off currently operating in a completely different stratosphere to any other band on this planet such is the originality of the avant pop troupes sound name our numbers numbers single carries the angry ape seal of approval recalling the likes of sonic youth talking heads and arcade fire this track follows their debut masterpiece the moon and stars remain in the morning sky which featured everything from theatrical singalongs morricone esque soundscaping and schizophrenic angular pop highly recommended
3670463 melding such gorgeous exploratory passages with the ethereal male female harmonies of arcade fire and a sedate indie rock aesthetic the bands sound is dreamy and hard to resist once it makes its way into your playlist your brain your life this is the type of album thats hard to set aside
3670464 superb sophomore effort by washington based drew sullivan frozen sheets of sound course through the epic ambient settings which dont so much showcase guitar virtuosity as they do lyrical beauty be sure to play the album loud in order to fully bask in its splendor
3670465 we are happy to report that cassinis begun sending data home

3670468 over the next few days and weeks the cassini teams will be analyzing the photos and other data to tease out new clues about this tiny active world
3670469 hydraulic energy from small dams is interesting because of its low environmental costs but everything has its limits
3670470 we predict that there will be fewer fish as a result of the energy projects on local rivers begun around 10 years ago because the dams block the fish from swimming upriver to breed
3670471 the affected rivers which are already polluted by agro chemical runoff flow towards the park where they form the xinga river and as a result the problems will be aggravated
3670472 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent
3670473 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3670474 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3670475 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3670476 because of those mistakes the americans had to watch chinas exuberant celebrations after sharing hugs with their conquerors the u s women left the stage to the gold medalists who practically floated out of the arena
3670477 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3670478 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope
3670479 there was a huge fight on july 18 at the romo home jessica and tony thought she was pregnant and happily announced it to the family the news resulted in dead silence
3670480 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges
3670481 anytime there is a domestic allegation the victim is offered an emergency protection order basically a restraining order she declined it she also declined medical treatment
3670482 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation
3670483 alan and lesley told me it was all a big misunderstanding and that nothing actually happened
3670484 in fact lesley wasnt even aware that alan had been arrested hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail
3670485 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion

3670493 my majestic stars songs reach for the sky like all the best post rock but you never get the sense hes trying to blow your face off mason steers well clear of obvious influences he manages to make music from relative isolation that like a lot of absolutely solo work tends towards the quiet and wounded ideas are the answer is optimistic from the title on down this a record that respects and honors our melancholy without ever falling for the fallacy that its a permanent state of affairs

3670505 its a big disappointment not to have him he was a massive part of our success last season and hes come back for pre season looking just as sharp if not sharper
3670506 by definition your job is to communicate a message via images and text
3670507 the husband and wife tandem of nathan and mandy tensen wollery create some interesting atmospheric melodies on this album sounding a bit like the cure if robert smith thought the keyboards were the end all and be all of the band the greatest asset this album possesses is how highbrow it is without being overly arty a great example of this is the lush reflective clean sinks and folded laundry a roughly three minute nugget that ebbs and flows ghost in the water go totally retro though for the chipper synth pop of how to draw a ghost another keeper has to be the majestic pushpins and tape

3670550 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3670551 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3670552 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3670553 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3670554 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3670555 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3670556 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3670557 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3670558 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3670559 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful

3670576 the most sever violation of human rights has been observed in the region and therefore we ask aid from international organizations i want to clear which bombs and shells the russian militaries used in gori the issue is needed to be cleared as russia cannot blame us in bombing of the city ourselves in future it is a classical ethnic cleaning which had been observed during the world war 2
3670577 while we discussing the issue the rights of most georgians have been violated by occupants we have agreed with french president sarkozy the ceasefire regime but russian occupants steal and kill our citizens in the country
3670578 perhaps the most obvious political effect of controlled news is the advantage it gives powerful people in getting their issues on the political agenda and defining those issues in ways likely to influence their resolution

3670580 the man who does not do his own thinking is a slave and is a traitor to himself and his fellow men
3670581 freedom of expression is the well spring of our civilization the history of civilization is in considerable measure the displacement of error which once held sway as official truth by beliefs which in turn have yielded to other truths therefore the liberty of man to search for truth ought not to be fettered no matter what orthodoxies he may challenge
3670582 freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much that would be a mere shadow of freedom the test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order

3670612 weve read over the thing 300 000 times and i just noticed that what we put in the petition was not what we submitted to the city
3670613 because certainly if this passes there will be some sort of legal challenge whether its by the proponents trying to get a court to correct what they labeled a drafting error
3670614 or if it were to pass whether it be a citizen who wants to challenge it because youre writing this into whats essentially the city constitution and youd have an error

3670626 the smell of paint and the sight of colorful tubes hanging on display shelves amazed me i enjoyed looking through cartoon and fairy tale books and admired the colorful drawings in each one
3670627 this love of color and drawings quickly transformed into an urge to create my own when i started taking up art classes in grade school it didnt take long until i realized that art is my life
3670628 now is the perfect time to take risks and explore my horizons as an artist and as a designer and singapore just happens to be the nearest and most convenient place to go to for that its both far enough for me to gain a wider world perspective and near enough that i can come home if the homesickness bug bites me
3670629 i needed an outlet for my creativity i bought a moleskine sketchbook and fell in love with the thick pages
3670630 ive been doing gouache paints since high school i love the rich and vivid colors for additional touches i use markers soft pastels and colored pencils
3670631 i post my artworks in my flickr account i also joined the flickr group moleskinerie and posted several of my artworks there
3670632 she chose several artists and moleskine users to participate in the london book fair and the tokyo interior life style exhibit i was beyond thrilled when i found out that i was one of them
3670633 it was such an honor being on the spotlight with other artists from europe and the us it made me a proud filipino being able to show others that we too can be world class artists
3670634 its quite hard because all of the themes that i used are very personal to me
3670635 each one is actually a piece of who i am like pieces in a puzzle put them all together look at the entire book and you will see who i am as a person
3670636 theyve asked me and two other artists to work on another set of artworks which they will keep and use for their future exhibits
3670637 not just because its my work but because i enjoy being able to weave and transform my ideas into spaces that marry both beauty and function

3670711 german artillery superiority on the western front was a myth
3670712 the ancient myths were designed to harmonize the mind and the body the mind can ramble off in strange ways and want things that the body does not want the myths and rites were a means of putting the mind in accord with the body and the way of life in accord with the way nature dictates
3670713 the knowledge of how to build a nest in a bare tree how to fly to the wintering place how to perform the mating dance all of this information is stored in the reservoirs of the birds instinctual brain but human beings sensing how much flexibility they might need in meeting new situations decided to store this sort of knowledge outside the instinctual system they stored it in stories

3670729 oh you think i belong with the trouble makers okay fine ill give you what you want
3670730 i looked at marcus someone who acted like such an asshole to me threatening me with a knife several times that year and for the first time i felt such sympathy towards him and all the others in this group
3670731 we want one class to have a liberal education we want another class a very much larger class of necessity to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks
3670732 the community building skill share by running a public skill share such as a rewild camp you can attract more people to rewilding and promote awareness for it while learning skills from others in the community you can also run a private skill share for just family and friends the purpose of the skill share comes back to the idea of building relationships and forming real cultures that hunt and gather together rather than continue to teach for money i believe in exchanges and trading and the skill share does exactly that you share your skills and learn from others who share theirs you exchange your talents and knowledge instead of money emphasis on social technologies not just artifact replication
3670733 i also think that it needs mentioning that these methods still lack an all encompassing cultural environmental economic system of sustainable management
3670734 n the 70s a bunch of hippies started discovering horticultural techniques and came up with the word permaculture
3670735 fuck it well see what happens even though im not happy with it
3670736 sending your asshole permaculture friends here to tear me a new one because i didnt articulate myself very well is bullshit
3670737 i also think that it needs mentioning that these methods still lack an all encompassing cultural environmental economic system of sustainable management in fact i believe any form of living that has sustainability does not think in terms of management but in relationships
3670738 thats all im saying permaculture is simply a movement about and only about food its not about story telling and primitive skills and animal tracking and team building etc etc its one aspect of a whole range of elements
3670739 dont listen to what the books say look at what people do
3670740 good idea but they forget that civilization wont go without a fight and it cant really work while civilization is around
3670741 the netherlands nutrition centre wants the brakes put on the growth of snack bars and fast food restaurants in neighbourhoods with an abundance of such outlets it wants local authorities to prevent any more being opened in areas around schools its demands are even stricter it wants a complete ban on any business selling fast food
3670742 you get in trouble when youre looking out there or back there
3670743 we took every team during the summer and broke them down
3670744 we study our first four or five opponents hard get three or four film breakdowns from last year and try to formulate a scouting report
3670745 you get in trouble when youre looking out there or back there
3670746 to be honest with you you kind of get used to it
3670747 hes actually a pretty good putter which is surprising for a guy his size
3670748 obviously he has to have some touch because he has to be able to throw a football in different ways
3670749 the guys have done a good job and keep fighting back
3670750 sometimes you dont have your stuff coming out of the gate
3670751 my command was a little shaky but i consider it a positive that i didnt let it spiral out of control
3670752 masa did not have a good night but perez picked us up
3670753 jeremy gave us a chance to win the game i think at times he tries to be too fine he had a good fastball tonight
3670754 hes had some good at bats from both sides of the plate
3670755 he worked hard at buffalo after being sent down and up here
3670756 but after what happened in the middle and with the guys bouncing back it was a good win jeremy was outstanding and were going to pick him up at some point
3670757 this no 1 ohio state defense right now is being toyed with by the lsu offense
3670758 we dont read the media much we dont hear much about it but you know theres doubters out there
3670759 we have the bulletin board material that ohio state cant do this cant do that we know about it we just have to step it up and prove them wrong
3670760 thats really what you aim for as a defense is to put up a goose egg
3670761 we feel like we didnt perform as well as we should
3670762 you just cant make the mistakes that we made and we all are very aware of that weve seen that film quite a few times
3670763 this trade is about creating an opportunity for some of our players
3670764 and giving paul a chance to get to the postseason it also gives us 2 million that ownership says we can allocate to next years team
3670765 i dont know if the trade is ironic because of the hgh thing
3670766 i think its more ironic because its the team that beat us i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason lets put it that way putting on that red sox jersey may take a minute or two the bottom line is ive played for terry francona in philadelphia and they have a good thing going over there in boston
3670767 i like the way the indians are playing right now
3670768 i like the guys in the clubhouse but were pretty far back in the standings ive dreamed of playing in the world series since i was a boy we almost made it last year im 37 ive only got so many chances left
3670769 and have a chance to win it all its still a big race over there
3670770 dunner made it clear to some of us in the clubhouse that his asking price is 120 million to 125 million
3670771 thats it theyre saying they are not going to build a strong team here
3670772 if they keep the pitchers they have now well be all right i think theyll go out and sign some hitters if we didnt have a veteran manager like dusty baker i might be concerned but im not
3670773 felt like a whirlwind for the first couple of innings
3670774 i was almost relieved with the five pitch walk to start the game then i stole a base and that relieved the pressure
3670775 and it was like a thousand pounds came off my chest
3670776 best play i ever made in the big leagues yes
3670777 the way weve been playing i was not going to let that ball get past me i was going to do everything possible to stop it
3670778 i was as surprised as everybody was but i cant judge him
3670779 in his mind i think he was just ive had enough
3670780 i admire him to be honest with you from the standpoint of if you dont like to do something then i guess you dont do it
3670781 he gave us everything he had all year long for his career here he decided that continuing to play wasnt best for him and im with him now too
3670782 hes trying his best not to let it bother him and hes been coming along very well
3670783 it probably made him a little better because hes out there grinding and working hard every day
3670784 i think terrelle is coming around really good right now
3670785 terrelle pryor there is a big hype about him coming in and i think he is taking that on very well hes out there running getting guys better making the defense break down
3670786 hes going to add a very great dimension for us as a mobile quarterback
3670787 its going to keep guys on their heels a little bit
3670788 theres going to be a different look around here i dont think anyone can predict what that look is going to be are they going to go out and get outfielders are they going to leave these young guys here
3670789 thats the unknown what are they going to do now
3670790 as long as they keep the pitching staff intact i think well be ok because i think dusty baker has enough pull to get them to go out and sign some hitters if we had a real young manager id be worried
3670791 i dont know if he told the media but he made it no secret to us that he was looking for a 100 to 120 million contract i dont think this franchise is going to give out that kind of contract
3670792 everyones talked about needing change every year they changed the bullpen they changed the rotation they changed certain parts but they never changed those two parts dunn and griffey
3670793 im going to put them in a position where they have the best chance to succeed
3670794 hopefully theyll give us some energy and speed its hard to replace junior and dunn its not about replacing them its about getting an opportunity to do their thing and what theyre capable of doing
3670795 we dont have a whole bunch of veterans left in the everyday lineup
3670796 most of the veterans are pitchers you always hope this is it if youve been in this game long enough you know that you cant worry about something thats out of your control thats easier said than done
3670797 the plan is the same go out and try to win
3670798 the front office has an idea of what they want to do the show must go on
3670799 theres going to be a different look around here i dont think anyone can predict what that look is going to be are they going to go out and get outfielders are they going to leave these young guys here
3670800 thats the unknown what are they going to do now
3670801 as long as they keep the pitching staff intact i think well be ok because i think dusty baker has enough pull to get them to go out and sign some hitters if we had a real young manager id be worried
3670802 i dont know if he told the media but he made it no secret to us that he was looking for a 100 to 120 million contract i dont think this franchise is going to give out that kind of contract
3670803 everyones talked about needing change every year they changed the bullpen they changed the rotation they changed certain parts but they never changed those two parts dunn and griffey
3670804 im going to put them in a position where they have the best chance to succeed
3670805 hopefully theyll give us some energy and speed its hard to replace junior and dunn its not about replacing them its about getting an opportunity to do their thing and what theyre capable of doing
3670806 we dont have a whole bunch of veterans left in the everyday lineup
3670807 most of the veterans are pitchers you always hope this is it if youve been in this game long enough you know that you cant worry about something thats out of your control thats easier said than done
3670808 the plan is the same go out and try to win
3670809 the front office has an idea of what they want to do the show must go on
3670810 i clearly feel that our program will begin revival era in human space
3670811 when they told me it was kind of what everybody says
3670812 it was an indescribable feeling i literally had no words no thoughts i was just holy cow
3670813 it didnt start sinking in until he told me to go home and start packing when i went home and started packing my heart started to race a little bit
3670814 that four pitch walk relaxed me getting the hit was like have a 1 000 pound weight lifted
3670815 for probably a month and a half ive been going good
3670816 i kind of modeled my swing off jay bruces a little bit i got more upright and got my hands up i saw improvements the ball started jumping off the bat
3670817 there are things every young guy had to work on
3670818 it looks like hes improved quite a bit with the bat hes got improvement still to do but hes better this year than he was last year
3670819 the past couple of years they emphasized me moving around
3670820 i played left quite a bit when jay was at louisville
3670821 i should be fine its not my favorite position in the world you dont see the ball well off the bat
3670822 i just dont think hes quite to point where he thinks he is ready to play center field every day
3670823 hes better hes closer whenever youve been injured youve got to get past the psychological part
3670824 when they told me it was kind of what everybody says
3670825 it was an indescribable feeling i literally had no words no thoughts i was just holy cow
3670826 it didnt start sinking in until he told me to go home and start packing when i went home and started packing my heart started to race a little bit
3670827 that four pitch walk relaxed me getting the hit was like have a 1 000 pound weight lifted
3670828 for probably a month and a half ive been going good
3670829 i kind of modeled my swing off jay bruces a little bit i got more upright and got my hands up i saw improvements the ball started jumping off the bat
3670830 there are things every young guy had to work on
3670831 it looks like hes improved quite a bit with the bat hes got improvement still to do but hes better this year than he was last year
3670832 the past couple of years they emphasized me moving around
3670833 i played left quite a bit when jay was at louisville
3670834 i should be fine its not my favorite position in the world you dont see the ball well off the bat

3670838 recalling that the 2006 switch from mtbe to ethanol put additional pressures on the gasoline markets and that ethanol is a growing source of gasoline volume eia also looks at projections of ethanol use in 2008
3670839 while the new rfs that was included in the recent energy bill will require increased ethanol use the speed of penetration into new regions may vary through the year with slower increases expected for the first half of 2008 than in the second half
3670840 the lower volume 50 thousand barrels per day is based on the average ethanol use increase seen in late 2006 through early 2007 this low estimate assumes that work on terminals and service stations and arrangements for transportation slow penetration in the early months

3670842 we are concerned that inflationary pressure on food will only escalate in the coming months

3670861 these nightmarish thoughts are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3670862 dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life
3670863 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment

3670865 land issues affect everybody and it is the basic source of livelihood for all ghanaians but it is never discussed as a national developmental issue
3670866 nations and communities have fought over it and its related conflicts remain one of the most difficult conflict situations to resolve
3670867 only god knows many other simmering ones that are yet to come to the limelight
3670868 victims are denied physical access and possession of these lands
3670869 there is now the loss of belief in land god concept
3670870 they now see traditional authorities to have a weak capacity to manage and arbitrate over land issues and land related conflicts political interference in customary land administration is also a factor

3670879 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3670880 the night before ozzfest august 9th we were in houston and it was cracking thunder and pouring down rain the following morning after a five hour drive i awoke at 9am in dallas to the sound of metal bands
3670881 to mention any bands whom i liked or didnt would only single out my particular taste instead of drawing attention to the fact that the lineup was diverse massive in the fact that it had well established artists as well as solo projects and shoot offs from other bands
3670882 a perfect example would be john davis or serj solo another example of this is cavalera conspiracy the fact that ozzy and metallica were on the same stage together in one night is mind blowing i can only hope that next years ozzfest works with this such model because it worked
3670883 from what i heard it sold out clean at 32 000 hello did you hear me 32 000 in the states for a festival to do those numbers are insane and lends credit to the fact that the usa can and will turn out for their metal festival much like the european fans
3670884 the side stages worked well because both the small stage and second stage were side by side and the bands just kept playing one after the other
3670885 the weather was hot the crowd was rowdy and the day ended perfect with two of the most legendary artists ozzy and metallica closing out a sold out metal concert we thank them for inviting devildriver we had a great time with a lot of good friends

3670946 it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3670947 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it
3670948 how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3670949 your excessive consumption of alcohol or use of illicit drugs contributed to the attack which caused your injuries
3670950 the compensation agency in northern ireland handles roughly 5 000 claims for criminal injury each year under legislation similar to that in great britain
3670951 each case is dealt with on its individual merits but compensation awards are not reduced solely because an applicant was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs
3670952 no woman is responsible for being raped a man knows what he is doing and it is never the womans fault
3670953 cicas policy is not to make a reduction on a claim for compensation following rape on the basis of alcohol consumption
3670954 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3670955 we deal with around 60 000 cases each year there may be times when an original decision is wrong this is why we have a review process to allow the applicant to challenge that decision

3670973 its so instant you get a reaction straight away having spent a lot of time making television recently you hunger for that immediate response
3670974 its great to find out what people think of your material right away rather than months or even years later you can improvise as youre going along which is a real thrill too live work is incredible and when it goes well nothing can beat it
3670975 the only way i can measure it is by the people who come up to us in the street it used to be just cool kids but now its cab drivers and chavs which is great because it means youre appealing to more people
3670976 in the past when i got into taxis the cabbies would always ask who are you now they immediately say the mighty boosh chavs come up to me and say that show is sick it doesnt sound it but apparently thats good

3670980 stuff like the office is great but people know where its coming from when i was young i used to watch the goodies or spike milligan and i had no idea where it was going we try to create a world that people can get into and love
3670981 my favourite programmes like monty python or the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy conjured up their own worlds once youd entered them you could go where you pleased we aim to do the same thing we put in all sorts of different elements music animation loads of characters
3670982 its never too narrow weve never stopped ourselves doing anything on the boosh
3670983 im sure well do things separately in the future but it really works as a double act
3670984 as individuals were very different and thats crucial to our success
3670985 weve created a universe we love and its fascinating to bring all sorts of different ideas to it difference is very important to us
3670986 and you have to maintain a healthy cynicism about it there is a flavour of the month aspect to it so you have to keep moving on and mutating were never precious about work we never say right thats it that is the crystallised form of the boosh
3670987 its vital to keep changing if we kept doing the same thing wed soon get bored and the audience would say weve seen that next fortunately there are loads of new places to take the boosh weve never had a day where weve said we havent got any ideas today
3670988 it is very disappointing i feel like i am fit but the ankle is unable to handle running quite yet

3671027 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3671028 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3671029 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3671030 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3671031 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3671032 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3671033 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3671034 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3671035 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3671036 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3671037 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3671038 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3671039 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3671040 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3671041 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3671042 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3671043 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3671044 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3671045 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3671046 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3671047 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3671048 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3671049 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3671050 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3671051 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3671052 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3671053 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3671061 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3671062 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3671063 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3671064 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3671065 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3671066 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3671067 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3671068 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3671069 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3671070 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3671071 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3671072 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3671075 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3671076 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3671109 anakku jika seorang laki laki yang benar benar bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarga itu memang akan demikian

3671120 i didnt like it but then i realized you know this is like a circus
3671121 im afraid i was on the phone to a theater help line immediately after the show
3671122 it doesnt do it justice to say its all improvised and they are playing around
3671123 its ridiculous how much time we spent on each little two minute gag
3671124 i mean within my genes my metabolism my you know brain space i know its there
3671125 detroit is so goddamned literal sometimes someones gotta break through with conceptual stuff malcolms really good
3671126 i arrived and found this tiny concierge he was probably like 4 foot 2 or something and i had to carry everything up several flights i only stayed there about six weeks i lived in about 20 places over the next two years
3671127 but there is also a rigor about it you have a direct complicity with the audience and you have to shift immediately depending on their reaction how you deal with the failure of a routine shows how good of a clown you are lecoq would say when you run out of ideas or youve failed you just have to wait and eventually lange qui pass an angel will pass someone will sneeze or react to something and then its about what you do with that gift
3671128 the italian commedia dellarte troupes reacted to being occupied by spaniards they portrayed both the upper class and the merchant class
3671129 and pantomime was a form of theater very difficult to censor how do you censor something without words
3671130 what is the new political theater form with the state this countrys in i dont know i dont think of these things constantly
3671131 i think he was attracted to the occasional avant circus approach to music we employed
3671132 its a play in which a knife throwing act mistakenly kills a member of the audience in the opening minutes the rest of the play deals with what to do next
3671133 his plays frequently can be summed up in a sentence or two however within that reduced framework is an explosion of ideas there are no simple answers as each act has a consequence and can lead you down an unexpected path not unlike the riffing of free improv it may seem spontaneous and wild but there is an active mind at work
3671134 hey how are you going to do this with all your lines to learn
3671135 the other ones i did like this worked so i thank you for your trust we will start gently
3671136 just to set up what weve got weve got the curtain got the narration slide show in fact therell be something already projected on the curtain dont know what therell be some music before the narration starts so well hear franks beautiful shit then the narration begins like this
3671137 to forget about the mortgage bill not trusting the babysitter an argument with a partner
3671138 now the question is going to end up being that the alarm clock is going off and were trying to turn it off but where the hell is it
3671139 ok so the next idea that just came out of that for me
3671140 was we all come closer during a hot potato with the clock
3671141 next thing to think of is that youre worried about the other person and that saves us from pausing after you throw it yeah so that we are each always doing something if the clock falls climb over and around each other to try to get it
3671142 ok so maybe that wasnt even the alarm clock you grabbed maybe it was a teddy bear and we have to keep looking for the clock or maybe there are seven going off anyway all that panic justifies the sort of ok lets get on with our day without realizing what has happened yet you know what lets scratch the whole hot potato idea even though it was a fantastic idea i had
3671143 is it worth it oh god lets just do waiting for godot in braille
3671144 ive watched the movies they never catch it the first time
3671145 dont act like a dog get the dog without the dog
3671146 i was asked to leave the boy scouts because i swore
3671147 when i direct conventional plays i still tend to do european ones ive done some american plays but i tend to go european not just because they talk like i do but thats my cultural reservoir
3671148 with this one im going to get more of an idea of what those reflections are i mean theyre already starting but once we get into rehearsals im not sure whats going to come bursting out but i know theres going to be something about that breakfast which will have to do with the importance of the silverware my father always had this different knife he used it was a bizarre quirk in my dad and now i have one at our house i think i stole it from somewhere i had a really good fork that i stole from a sushi place in d c but that got lost
3671149 its a lot of moving forward and jumping back at this point by next week we will push forward to the end you cant be scared you have to be in control of time but cant be scared of time things can remain pretty messy for longer than youd think
3671150 i need to take my brain out wine it dine it talk stupid to it
3671151 what is the most productive thing i can do in these five minutes be still be silent i dont believe in that mysticism shit its difficult to stop talking right the silence is oppressive
3671152 i really hated him he was too weird for me i was already doing a lot of theater and he wasnt what i expected he was a freaky european dude
3671153 it made me want to continue to pursue theater i just really began to love his direction because he was so specific he would pull a lot out of us in a very grounded way because he was so physical there wasnt a lot of psychologizing
3671154 a lot of it has to do with becoming attuned to the natural elements
3671155 we take up something like fire for example in dance class how do you tell a story with fire if you have people embodying fire in what ways does it grow how does it simmer how does it explode then you apply it to a situation
3671156 the main thing about malcolm that blows my mind is seeing what he can come up with through improvisation its where his genius lies the things he discovers from just trying to move an object trying to put on a tie if youre moving in one direction theres a certain amount of possibilities to where youll go what youll make of those possibilities hes very comfortable with that
3671157 my relationships with my parents change i have a dramatic journey and it didnt happen purposefully
3671158 you know some people talk about how at this stage the piece really needs an audience the reason we need it is so i stop having ideas
3671159 les images photo retir es des vid os de surveillance cctv enregistr es quelques heures apr s quelle ait disparu de la villa dalgarve pourquoi la police maintenu secret
3671160 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3671161 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3671162 this goes a long way to help those survivors in their recovery
3671163 they have begun the process of coming clean and transparent in a way they have never done before its now no longer about secrets its about protection
3671164 in the sense im responsible for this archdiocese i have to accept the blame

3671166 on return from beijing this morning i have been briefed on matters related to monika devi one of our weightlifters questions arose about her dope testing and the timing and release of the reports which led to her not being sent to beijing olympics
3671167 into all aspects of this matter immediately so as to bring out the precise truth
3671168 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3671169 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3671170 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3671171 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3671172 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3671173 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3671174 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3671175 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3671176 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3671177 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3671178 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3671179 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it
3671180 now the old king is dead long live the king

3671182 de werkelijke vraag is waarom maakt dns zoveel uit de onderliggende problematiek is de aanname dat er een verschil is tussen kwaadaardige en veilige netwerken dns is een fantastische manier om die waanvoorstelling onderuit te halen zeker achter firewalls zelfs als we van 32 bits naar 128 bits entropy gaan als we dnssec gebruiken dan leveren we nog steeds mail op een onveilige manier af

3671191 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3671192 we have said that the sanctions should not be lifted without the return of all abductees and our stance will never change
3671193 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results

3671201 i can now see some smoke rising up so it would suggest theres fighting taking place
3671202 one woman came out and collapsed on the floor and said where are our forces
3671203 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3671204 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3671205 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3671206 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3671207 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3671208 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3671209 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3671210 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3671211 the hands of the criminals have hit in tripoli against innocent soldiers and civilians

3671222 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3671223 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3671224 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3671225 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly

3671236 no my films are misinterpreted all the time i dont mind that everybodys films are misinterpreted but theres no malice or stupidity in the people that misinterpret them you know what you do but someone else sees it and they want to talk about it or write about it and so they misinterpret them but those are not any darker than vicky cristina barcelona and certainly no darker than cassandras dream or match point these are all quite dark films and the films that im making at the time contrary to what people might think are not a reflection of whats going on in my life people think that the way i feel in my private life at the moment reflects how i make films but everyone who makes films or does any kind of creative art will tell you that thats not so that sometimes when im feeling my happiest and everythings going well in my life and my love life is wonderful and my health is wonderful ill make my darkest most depressing kind of thing and other times when things are not going well for me and im having a hard personal time i could be making my silliest comedies i was not in a particularly happy state of mind or place in my life at all when i made take the money and run and bananas this is not a good time in my life theres no reflection in ones personal life and ive heard this from other artists as well that people tend to think the product is a reflection of their personal feeling at the time when in fact it isnt really its just a matter of what idea they can come up with or whatever strikes them inspirationally having no relation to their personal mood

3671239 this is the first time where weve seen israeli society in general being so open to consider who yeshua is
3671240 this is a real miracle and theres beginning to be grace and favor with us in the land
3671241 i believe with all my heart after we have come back to the land we are seeing the lord the holy spirit is removing the veil from the eyes of the jews and more and more jews are realizing
3671242 marriage should be honoured by all and the marriage bed kept pure for god will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral
3671243 some say faith is the enemy of reason i say they are wrong
3671244 they are great partners rich in history and scientific progress
3671245 among the more prevalent are alcohol and drug abuse and the exaltation of violence and sexual degradation often presented through television and the internet as entertainment
3671246 relativism by indiscriminately giving value to practically everything has made experience all important yet experiences detached from any consideration of what is good or true can lead not to genuine freedom but to moral or intellectual confusion to a lowering of standards to a loss of self respect and even to despair
3671247 how can it be that the most wondrous and sacred human space the womb has become a place of unutterable violence
3671248 the fire of god mightily fell at both meetings the ctfm meeting saw many people healed physically as well as spiritually a wonderful miracle in sydney was a woman who was 80 deaf in both ears and could not hear clearly at all without hearing aids as i prayed she received her healing instantly no longer needing her hearing aids as people watched this healing their faith was enlarged they were mightily moved by the presence and power of god many flocking to the altar for an impartation from the lord god almighty hungry for him and drinking from his river of life i thank god that i decided to continue to travel and minister as i see gods supernatural hand at work in every meeting all glory goes to him for all that he does
3671249 my pain is gone my pain is gone i feel so much better
3671250 in greek culture we thank people like this taking pastor dannys hand and started kissing it

3671252 in the letter seen by the weekend australian mr andrews accused the case workers in australian embassies of fraud and bribery when processing migration applications
3671253 my heart reaches out to all of you including those who are sick or in difficulties of any kind
3671254 where can we look for answers the spirit points us towards the way that leads to life to love and to truth the spirit points us towards jesus christ
3671255 its really exciting to be with other youth from all over the world especially those that share the same faith as you
3671256 i think we would love to see the church and the faith flourish here and i think thats probably one of the main reasons why the holy father chose this area he wanted to bolster the faith down here
3671257 have bible believers been in error for centuries in refusing to recognize the roman catholic church as a part of the true church of christ
3671258 it is interesting that in reporting the signing of the ecumenical document the national and international religion report commented what brought the two communities together to this point some signers said are the experiences of worshipping together in the charismatic movement this is but another evidence of the impetus toward ecumenism which has been generated by the modern charismatic movement charismatics find common ground in their shared experience and see no doctrinal impediment to full cooperation with one another charismatics seem to be able to span the widest theological gulf with no problem whatsoever

3671263 hi pastor danny and crew clayton bjelan here from light fm
3671264 thank you pastor danny for being so faithful to god in coming to brisbane for some time my husband has been saying to me to get my ears tested as he was concerned i had a problem on monday 21 7 08 my ears were tested showing my left ear had a concerned hearing loss and my right ear a small amount of hearing loss when you put your hand over my left ear and prayed there was movement like god was doing a recreating inside my ear my hearing was becoming clearer and sharper my praise and thanks to our loving god for this miracle of healing in christ jesus name
3671265 i want love from jesus so that i could love others better and tell them about jesus
3671266 i am so excited as i clearly see revival fires sweeping across australia our hour of visitation is upon us and we must not miss it we must turn this into a habitation with god

3671269 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3671270 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3671271 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it

3671274 the latest uk labour market figures show that the rise in
3671275 the claimant count rose for the sixth month in a row in july with the 20 100 rise the biggest seen so far in this downturn
3671276 the labour market is now being hit increasingly hard by the economic downturn and depressed business confidence
3671277 we were cleaning the bedroom i went to vacuum downstairs while she was cleaning the floors upstairs
3671278 i finished vacuuming and shouted up asking her if she wanted a cup of tea
3671279 i didnt get a reply so i sat down for a few minutes and shouted again
3671280 i wandered upstairs to see where she was and realised she wasnt there i went downstairs looking for her
3671281 he did some first aid and she said to us ive jumped
3671282 just before she was taken away by paramedics she said to me why did i jump
3671283 im not saying that she didnt jump but i do find it strange that we were in the middle of working
3671284 realistically there was no chance of her falling accidentally unless she climbed on to the air conditioning unit but i cant think of any reason why she would do that
3671285 if it was suicide it was impulsive or just a cry for help like the other ones
3671286 the spectrum of views in the eu is very wide
3671287 close to putins position this war has pushed georgia further away from europe
3671288 in de afgelopen maanden is een strijd aan de gang tussen een soennitische groepering en een groep die gelieerd zou zijn aan de hezbollah deze strijd heeft iets weg van een etnische strijd maar draait vooral om wie de controle krijgt over de stad tripoli
3671289 but this is the first time that a study really gives the cold hard facts
3671290 when people dont have good jobs to support families i think that leads to depression and anxiety which in tern leads to substance abuse
3671291 ik heb het aan mezelf te wijten ik heb fouten gemaakt gewoon stom
3671292 dat had ik niet verwacht ik besefte pas in de laatste seconde van die partij dat mijn loopbaan ten einde was

3671295 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports
3671296 there were reports about presence of arab turkmen and local militants in the two hideouts run by a local commander zanjir wazir
3671297 my goggles pretty much filled with water and it kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3671298 but i wanted to break the record i wanted to 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3671299 i have been expecting to win for the last four years

3671301 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
3671302 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
3671303 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
3671304 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
3671305 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
3671306 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
3671307 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
3671308 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
3671309 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
3671310 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
3671311 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead superfund site toxins
3671312 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3671313 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3671314 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3671315 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3671316 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3671317 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3671318 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3671319 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3671320 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3671321 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3671323 i noticed the enlargement and also the texture began to look like an orange peel
3671324 i just heard the word cancer and it blew my mind
3671325 i was very very scared i was looking at the fact that i had a child and the word cancer is not a good word to hear
3671326 the issue with the inflammatory disease is that generally by the time the disease is manifest it has spread to other areas of the body and is more difficult to fully detect
3671327 weve been told to make sure to give yourself a self exam to make sure you dont have a lump
3671328 but there has been little education on inflammatory breast cancer so we need to get that type of breast cancer out and let women as well as men know that type of cancer exists
3671329 dat is een geheim ik vind het allemaal wel heel indrukwekkend
3671330 dit is echt heel mooi ik heb dit nog nooit eerder gezien
3671331 im hoping if we can get enough attention and rally hard enough that we really want to keep our starbucks that it might do something
3671332 if you look around and you see other chains that are nationally ranked this store is right in the heart of all of it
3671333 well the first plant in halifax came online in november and the results were dramatic

3671335 one of the disincentives to drilling into a patent portfolio to search out further value enhancing opportunities is cost however there are ways to save significant amounts of money something that financial modelling will help patent owners discover
3671336 they did display scarring that is consistent with dogs used for felony dogfighting purposes
3671337 its just too much of a liability for our agency to place those dogs it seems like the poor dogs are on the losing end all around

3671339 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3671340 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3671341 conservatives dont give a shit about you till you reach military age thats right conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers

3671343 most savagely of all were punished any offenders whose behaviour challenged calvins political and spiritual infallibility
3671344 in and by itself the very notion of heretic is absurd as far as a protestant church is concerned since protestants demand that everyone shall have the right of interpretation
3671345 defence of the true faith and of the trinity against the dreadful errors of servetus
3671346 all regard for things human that can be considered truly pious
3671347 when i reflect on what a heretic really is i can find no other criterion than that we are all heretics in the eyes of those who do not share our views
3671348 a whole era its leaders princes and priests catholics and lutherans alike
3671349 freedom of thought had a sacred right of asylum in europe
3671350 we can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time we can at any rate come to general understandings can love one another and can enter the bonds of peace
3671351 the notion of liberty the liberty of nations of individuals of thoughts had been accepted as an inalienable maxim by the civilized world

3671359 i dove in and they filled right up with water
3671360 it got worse and worse as the race went on at the 150 meter wall to the finish i couldnt see the wall i was hoping i was winning and hoping i would touch the wall first
3671361 when i was on the award ceremony for the 200 fly i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up
3671362 to be at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3671363 i had a pretty good idea we could go seven minutes
3671364 i definitely feels good to be the first group the first country ever to go under seven
3671365 i knew i was capable of doing a fast split i think i did that so it feels good
3671366 i dove in and they filled right up with water
3671367 it got worse and worse as the race went on at the 150 meter wall to the finish i couldnt see the wall i was hoping i was winning and hoping i would touch the wall first

3671373 a publishing company is difficult to sustain with only two publications
3671374 we continue to believe in media as a sector and in supporting small and medium sized enterprises promoting economic diversity and facilitating job creation
3671375 we wanted to make it even more clear than we have in the past that theres a dangerous situation along this trail corridor right now
3671376 weve been posting the area for some time now warning people about bears in the area but apparently theres still consistent use on that trail over the last couple of weeks
3671377 a lot of times well try to clear the area just to make sure we have a safe backdrop
3671378 it would have been really simple for them to just say pay the interest ive given up the supreme court
3671379 it is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping
3671380 having said that were going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close
3671381 the legally correct amount necessary to deter exxon and others from future oil spills
3671382 but the reality is the supreme court has declined to rule on this motion by the plaintiffs so we will participate in that process in a timetable mandated by the court its really in the ninth circuits hands

3671385 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3671386 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible

3671411 to me this just represents a shell game its not really dealing with the systemic issues with the department

3671426 the operation has been halted not by demand of president bush but because all objectives set by russias president were attained
3671427 the phrases in signed documents on settling the conflict of georgia and s ossetia about the necessity to set to the extra national discussion of methods for ensuring lasting security of south ossetia and abkhazia mean of course that those issues couldnt be tackled out of the status context
3671428 they should be considered exactly in status terms with regard to objective situation and with regard to administrative systems existence in abkhazia and south ossetia
3671429 nato we should realize nato has no military mandate in the south caucasus
3671430 so if youre saying nato cant resolve this question militarily then youre right we cant and that is not natos ambition and thats not in natos mandate
3671431 theyre part of a growing breed of young women who are claiming the nerd label for themselves in doing so theyre challenging the notion of what a geek should look like either by intentionally sexing up their tech personas or by simply finding no disconnect between their geeky pursuits and more traditionally girly interests such as fashion makeup and high heels
3671432 dieser vorgang ist strafbar das hat mit dialogmarketing nichts zu tun das ist schlicht und einfach kriminell der verband setzt alles daran den ermittlungsbeh rden bei der aufkl rung dieses missbrauchs zu helfen und die verbraucherzentrale dabei zu unterst tzen solchen einzelf llen sofort den riegel vorzuschieben

3671435 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3671436 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3671437 it has been horrible and it is still not very nice knowing that a brother son and father disappeared and we never had a last word with him
3671438 it is something we felt from the beginning that we were never going to find out because his remains were unrecognisable
3671439 all we were told was that it would be formally closed and that an open verdict would be announced
3671440 but we did not realise that we would be able to go and i must admit that i am rather disappointed with the whole set up
3671441 if it was not for the fact that we had a phone call from the eadt then we would have read about this in the newspaper
3671442 because the associated remains are so decomposed we have no ascertainable cause of death and because the cause of death is unascertainable there still remains unanswered questions into the sad circumstances in which he passed away
3671443 i can only record an open verdict as we do not have a cause of death

3671477 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3671478 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3671479 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3671480 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3671481 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3671482 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3671483 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3671484 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3671494 this year unfortunately through a few injuries ive had to be thrown all over the ground that hasnt been a bad thing
3671495 hopefully ive been able to add a little bit to the team and a little bit of versatility to my game im happy to be playing in the team in any sort of role
3671496 leo is such a fantastic player it is difficult to cover someone like that but weve adjusted quite well
3671497 theres a few different players shouldering a bit more of the load and being given a bit more responsibility to some of the younger players like heath grundy
3671498 they are very versatile in their forward line with leading players who can take a pack mark theres players who are great on the ground

3671501 i encountered one such woman recently she came to me quite upset because windows xp on her computer had become corrupted somehow and a technician re installed it for her but she was missing several years worth of pictures of her child when he was a baby shed never run a single backup in four years and despite my efforts using undelete software i was only able to recover a fraction of the photos shed lost it was heartbreaking to have to tell her that several years worth of photos were lost forever

3671510 i believe in backing success and i also have the view that governments are not the repositories of all wisdom
3671511 that means that when you get great community sector work like this as clontarf has done now over many many years id much rather back success when i see it than re invent the wheel
3671512 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3671543 the majority of georgian migrants stay in russia illegally last year about 321 000 people from this area crossed our border for different purposes and a mere 4 500 of them work in russia legally we will toughen measures against them up to deportation
3671544 the suit contains material showing that russia has committed ethnic cleansing against georgia during three interventions in south ossetia and abkhazia from 1993 to 2008
3671545 i feel we rode our luck at times today dublin were a tough side and our passing was poor but the girls showed great character to maintain their drive after conceding the equaliser i know that we can play at a higher tempo than we showed today this is a real ly good footballing side and we are looking forward to the quarter final draw
3671546 the lads deserve huge credit for the battling qualities they showed out there they showed today that theyre a mayo team that will never give up
3671547 weve won games easy and now weve won games very hard and the next game will be no different
3671548 eoin reilly got injured early on kevin keane dislocated his thumb and aidan oshea pulled his hamstring but we just kept battling
3671549 ive always said that teams win matches panels win competitions and our panel is going to be tested from now on
3671550 i was very worried at half time because in all fairness monaghan werent going to lie down this was last chance saloon for both teams and every player on the pitch was working their heart out
3671551 the breeze made a lottery of the game and if there hadnt been such a strong wind i think wed have had a massive game of football
3671552 there was some huge tackling out there today there was so much pressure put on the player on the ball by both sides and this led to some misdirected passes and poor shooting
3671553 every time a lad got the ball and looked up there were two or three lads in his face in fairness the tackling out there was very close to what youd see in senior matches and our lads will learn a lot from that
3671554 it takes a while for 17 or 18 year old lads to develop composure in that kind of situation as a result probably a lot of the ball going into the forward line was a bit kamikaze
3671555 their centre back had a massive game for them sweeping up a lot of balls its hard you try to force the thing with the wind and it doesnt always work
3671556 i knew that monaghan would come back into it at some stage and they did we had a chance to go three up just after half time and didnt take it and i think if wed done that we might have pushed on but they came down the pitch and went in front and we had to battle for everything

3671563 i looked up the time that the winner of the individual pursuit had done in the previous olympics
3671564 i figured that its going to be a bit quicker this time around and tried to work out the wattage needed to win gold and decided to go for it
3671565 youre only talking a handful of seconds at the world cups and the world championships i didnt ride the black line all that well which is basically the shortest point from a to b
3671566 its pretty hard to stay on a line half an inch thick when youre doing 40 miles an hour but the top guys stay down on the line and if i could do that consistently it could save me a second

3671687 famously well famously in wolverhampton anyway wolves failed to secure any cut of subsequent transfer fees paid for robbie keane when they sold him to coventry
3671688 as robbie has featured in yet another multi million pound transfer this typically molineuxesque incompetence has lost the club a sizeable chunk of income but which lower league team has been most astute in the sell on practise
3671689 first subsequent transfer immediately following the clause being drawn up not for all future revenues for the rest of the players career
3671690 six hundred times greater than our record outlay on a player
3671691 we paid 500 000 if he scored 25 goals another 500 000 when he scored 50 goals or it might have been appearances and yet another 500 000 if he played for england
3671692 going in to the last day of the first season forest were promoted and stanley was on the bench stuck on 24 goals for some unknown reason frank clark sent him on with 20 minutes to go and within a minute or two hed scored and cost the club another half a million the second installment came and went but i believe after his second season with forest which was also his last he was called up to the england squad and played only to be sold to liverpool a week or two later another half million paid out for nowt
3671693 i was wondering who is the oldest player ever to turn pro
3671694 i remember tony book being something like 29 when he signed for manchester city but he may have been a pro in non league football before that
3671695 paul first played for us in 1995 as a 21 year old when we were a northern premier league club and came back to us at the same level in 2000
3671696 the club turned professional for the 2004 05 season when paul was 30 he made his football league debut in august 2006 aged 32 so far hes played 411 games for stanley a club record and scored 186 goals
3671697 i believe that made him the oldest professional debutant since the war
3671698 i cant remember the circumstances behind him playing at cardiff if memory serves but no doubt it was due to a wafer thin squad
3671699 when clubs had to be voted in to the league players had to decide whether to give up their day jobs and go full time
3671700 this happened to a relative mick worswick who was in his mid 30s in 1978 when wigan joined the league but who had a job with much better pay and prospects than fourth division wages i would guess this era would be where the oldest player to turn pro would be found or perhaps when professionalism was introduced in 1882
3671701 geographically its in asia and its only relatively recently been designated a capital city but it is around three times larger than the belarusian capital and while genclerbirligi have played in the uefa cup a champions league place has so far eluded them and arch rivals ankarag c

3671703 so the rangers lost to fbk kaunas on august 4 sending them out of the champions league having been beaten in the uefa cup final by zenit st petersburg on may 14 meaning they were booted from europe twice in just 82 days has anyone ever gone out of europe twice that quickly
3671704 with several teams in league two already receiving points deductions i was wondering which professional division has had the highest percentage of teams finish the season with points deductions
3671705 you want to do what its over four miles of walking in the rough up and down while carrying a 30 pound sign that must be changed as the scores change and its gonna be 85 degrees or more with matching humidity can you do it

3671708 its important to change the numbers of each golfer quickly and before going to the next tee the fans in the gallery want correct scores youll be walking with an official scorer who will have the correct number if you dont

3671712 theres an asymmetry at the moment for sterling with regard to interest rates because if you get an upside surprise in inflation it somewhat reduces the likelihood of a cut but it also shows the squeeze faced by consumers and the real economy
3671713 the report will probably show theres quite a bit of division within the mpc on where the emphasis for policy should be the upside risks to inflation or the downside risks to growth
3671714 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3671715 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3671716 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3671717 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3671718 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3671764 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3671765 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3671766 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3671767 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3671768 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3671769 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3671770 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3671771 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3671772 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3671773 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3671774 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3671775 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3671776 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3671777 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3671778 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3671779 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3671780 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3671781 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3671782 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3671783 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3671784 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3671785 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3671786 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3671787 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3671788 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3671789 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3671790 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3671791 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3671792 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3671793 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3671794 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3671795 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing

3671811 american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain
3671812 the russians have clearly demonstrated their military capability of getting very close to the pipelines
3671813 and they also sent the black sea fleet off the georgian coast so they also have demonstrated that they can blockade georgia anytime they want
3671814 investors would have to reconsider how attractive those projects are
3671815 for russia control of georgia and the pipeline would restore much of its influence over many of the former satellites of the u s s r
3671816 it would have the clear benefit of increasing russias energy chokehold on europe
3671817 when the russians are trying to claw back their power energy is the major lever in their pursuit to do so
3671818 the georgian president brought in the whole pipeline issue to probably send more worries to the west and especially to the european consumers to draw more attention to the conflict
3671819 its not that we should ignore it but its certainly not a cause to panic
3671820 red alert act 3 to all personnel in charge now i sat and thought about what i could do it seemed so bleak
3671821 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team
3671822 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
3671823 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it

3671826 civil society movements ngos and the malaysian bar council must not remain silent
3671827 they dont want to rebuild the soviet union but they do want a sphere of influence
3671828 i think this was aimed much more to the west more to ukraine central asia and the other caucasus states
3671829 i worry that any country in the region such as ukraine that has been tilting towards the u s may now think twice they may lean back a bit toward russia
3671830 for 3 1 2 centuries russia has dominated its neighborhood
3671831 throwing a gantlet down saying that there isnt going to be any more nato enlargement
3671832 i think that american officials and analysts and i would put myself in this boat underestimated the scope of the russian reaction to kosovos separation from serbia
3671833 the russians at the time said that they may well retaliate by stirring up trouble in abkhazia and south ossetia and i think many people said well thats going to be mostly talk in fact theyve gone ahead and done it
3671834 is demonstrating to the rest of the world that the united states is not the sole superpower any more or if it is its so stretched that its not going to come to your aid
3671835 that weakens the u s position globally quite a bit
3671836 yang satu bilang ini urusan tuhan yang lain bilang ini urusan manusia susah itu
3671837 there has always seemed to be a split within the government so a consistent policy for dealing with russia has been absent
3671838 in the first term there were a lot of hard liners on russia who did not look kindly on cooperation
3671839 it would be great if we were to announce we are going to help the georgians rebuild as part of the compensation for their efforts in iraq
3671840 at what point does the west do something meaningful having the president backslapping with putin at the olympics is not a serious attempt to deal with the problem
3671841 the georgians who took us at our word when we talked about a partnership have got to be wondering what bush is all about
3671842 the last thing russia wants is a war with the west if they came eye to eye with nato warplanes they would retreat
3671843 i would have rather the russians hadnt responded but saakashvili sure did it and he did it in the mistaken belief i believe that he had friends in the bush administrations court
3671844 we have consistently and on thursday also urged the georgians not to move their forces in we were unambiguous about it
3671845 saakashvili had always told us he could not stand by while georgian villages were being shelled and we always knew this was a point of pressure we always told him that he should not give in to the kind of provocations we knew the russians were capable of
3671846 i think the state department was assiduous in urging restraint and saakashvilis buddies in the white house and office of the vice president kept egging him on
3671847 that allowed him to misinterpret the degree and depth of our support

3671850 acidification would directly affect anything in the ocean that has a shell about half of the total value of u s fisheries
3671851 we are undertaking a massive experiment on coral reefs and on the ocean in general
3671852 we are now observing what may become in the absence of policy changes a collapsing ocean ecosystem with climate the final coup dgrace
3671853 what ive seen in the past few decades is beyond strange
3671854 this is an environmental catastrophe the question has been whether coral reefs are the canary in the coalmine for the oceans the answer to that is clearly yes but the canary has already passed out on the floor of the cage the question now is whether we can revive the canary
3671855 faster bigger and more dangerous than anyone thought possible before
3671856 we will have to do something very drastic in terms of reducing co2 emissions or we will bring about the end of coral reefs as we know them
3671857 coral animals dont necessarily die in highly acidic waters instead they turn into little sea anemone like creatures attached to a hard substrate but they stop building skeletons over time storms and currents pound whats left of the three dimensional complexity of reefs that can be seen from space the reef structures would eventually disappear
3671858 oceans are going to change in a very complex fashion as they warm and become acidic at the same time
3671859 were facing double jeopardy with potential synergistic influences between increasing acidity and higher seawater temperature

3671884 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3671885 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3671886 current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3671887 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements

3671919 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly
3671920 this has nothing to do with bakassi it is just a normal routine patrol of the operation mesa the codename of joint security outfit in cross river state
3671921 you know recently there have been increased activities by militants in the peninsula and we are providing our own security measures
3671922 the inspector general of police has put all modalities in place as far as police is concerned likewise other security agencies everybody is fully aware and doing everything possible to make sure that the final handover of the remaining part of bakassi to cameroon is successful
3671923 from the further affidavits of the plaintiffs it is clear that there was a dispute over the boundaries between nigeria and cameroon and the international court of justice icj delivered judgment dated 10th october 2002
3671924 the part of the territory these plaintiffs have brought before this court was involved in the area litigated upon at the icj since the issue had been determined at that level the decision binds all sovereign states that are members of united nations and no forum domesticum of member states can assume jurisdiction to review again what has been decided by the icj
3671925 what has been of concern to the president and will be a priority to him is the welfare of the people of bakassi as bona fide citizens of nigeria who have found themselves in a territory legally given to another country
3671926 we are going about our normal life we are not ready to move an inch from our ancestral home
3671927 the militants are battle ready to forestall any handing over as far as we are concerned the national assembly has not ratified the treaty gowon signed with ahijo hence bakassi remains our land and territory
3671928 we are warning the un and others to stay clear of the peninsula or else they will regret their actions how can the nigerian government be so cowardly to hand over a territory that the entire nation through the national assembly has not given its blessings
3671929 on thursday august 14 2008 the cross river state government will be playing host to officials from the presidency and the international community at abana during the official handing over ceremony of the bakassi peninsula to the republic of cameroon
3671930 the handing over ceremony will be in keeping with the judgment of the international court of justice at the hague and in line with nigerias desire to maintain her leadership position ensure peace and good neighbourliness in africa and the world at large
3671931 as a government that believes in the rule of law we want to appeal to the displaced people of bakassi and other ethnic nationalities residing in the area and in the new bakassi resettlement camp to remain calm and cooperate with the federal and state governments to ensure a smooth and memorable handing over ceremony
3671932 let me assure the bakassi people of the desire of the cross river state government to integrate all nigerian citizens in bakassi into the economy of the state by providing ample opportunity for those willing to promote enterprise learn one trade or the other to do so
3671933 i think we are going to meet with the presidency it is important that we sit down and find an amicable way of solving the problem
3671934 the speaker has been away but he is back now and the senate is also resuming today to pass the 2008 budget amendment so the senate president will also be available
3671935 we moved a motion on the issue and it was unanimous we invited the foreign affairs minister chief ojo maduekwe and the attorney general and minister for justice but they refused to come
3671936 the president preaches due process and rule of law and should be seen to respect resolutions of other arms of government the judiciary gave an injunction restraining him from handing over the peninsula and so let this two institutions be respected

3671960 youll eat better and often cheaper and youll help sustain our small food and farming business through what promises to be their toughest test yet
3671961 supermarkets are not as cheap as they would have us believe
3671962 the hype they generate is little more than window dressing designed to cover up the fact they cynically view the current credit crunch as the perfect opportunity to increase market share and eliminate yet more local competition
3671963 yes they shave a few pence of some basic lines but if you want the best value on quality fresh meat fish or vegetables youll generally do better in your local farm shop or farmers market and when it comes to top notch cheeses charcuterie preserves and baked goods your local deli may cost a few pence more but they wont try to sell you mutton dressed as lamb
3671964 on the supplier side everyone knows who is taking the real pain and its not the supermarkets
3671965 supermarkets talk the talk when it comes to stocking local foods but the reality is hype
3671966 waitrose is probably the best of the bunch but even in their new market town format stores only 100 out of 10 15 000 lines are local and that includes milk thats less than 0 01
3671967 for larger supermarkets the percentage is even lower thats not what i call supporting small local food and farming businesses
3671968 in a time of recession there has been no decrease in new store developments in areas already drowning in supermarkets and in the few towns left untouched by the blight of a giant tesco or asda planning applications pushed through to local councils starved of cash and unable to fight protracted appeals shows no sign of diminishing

3671972 in the spirit of business unusual the northern cape provincial government has recognised the important role that tourism and infrastructure can play as impetus for economic growth and development in the province
3671973 as emphasised in the northern cape provincial growth and development strategy the potential for the northern cape province to develop into a competitive tourism destination is significant
3671974 indeed tourist attractions such as the big hole the largest man made excavation in the world with its popular underground mine tours are an important impetus for the tourism industry in kimberley
3671975 the provincial government made a commitment to assist with the funding of the building of the conference centre as part of its contribution to the overall development of the big hole development project at an estimated cost of r93 million
3671976 an estimated 350 people mostly youth from the local community will be employed in this project
3671977 during the week of 27july 3 august 2008 the northern cape provincial government showcased national construction week
3671978 during this week government encouraged the active participation of young people in the construction industry and also celebrated the excellence of emerging contractors and their contribution to the promotion of growth development and transformation of the construction industry
3671979 in line with the joint initiative of priority skills acquisition jipsa and the context of achieving the targeted 6 percent economic growth for the province the involvement of young people in scarce skills such as engineering and architecture is central to the overall objectives of the broader government
3671980 jipsa arose out of a dire need to attract scarce skills to the youth of this country
3671981 we live at a time when the governed are governed on the basis of continued service delivery where leaders retain the loyalty and respect of their constituencies because they are vehicles for development
3671982 traditional leadership has become much more than just heredity it has become as much a service as being served and also about making a difference in the lives they lead
3671983 we hope our traditional leaders shall latch on to this opportunity and also take full advantage of this training and equip themselves with the skills on offer so that their leadership abilities may be enhanced even further
3671984 we would like to unleash the power of traditional leaders to empower themselves as well as those people they serve and we also want to make them feel both fulfilled as individuals and confident as leaders of their communities
3671985 with traditional governance brought in line with current corporate governance principles and practices it cannot be denied that relevant tools such as ict will be required to effect the latest approaches and that facilities such as proper offices and boardrooms would be justifiable
3671986 it is against the background of all the benefits i have catalogued that we welcome this training programme with open arms
3671987 we are among the first provinces in the country to develop and enact legislation to institutionalise cooperative governance between government and dikgosi chiefs so that the two institutions could jointly better the lives of our people
3671988 we went on to establish local houses of traditional leadership to work together with both district and local municipalities in common efforts to develop rural communities
3671989 uy va a ser que no me llega voy a salir un momento

3671991 its would also consider the memorandum of understanding between the sadc secretariat development bank of south africa and deed of trust and the records of the july 2008 trade and finance ministerial meeting held in lusaka zambia
3671992 we do believe that out of this summit and under our chairpersonship we must ensure that we are able to take the processes of integration to a much higher level staring with the free trade area and then moving much faster integrating our economies
3671993 it is clear that a successful sadc regional economic bloc will make a major impact on other regional economies in africa
3671994 we are appealing to churches of various religions in the province as they gather here in this summit to understand that they can play a huge role in changing society
3671995 our country is experiencing challenges which need churches to come together and look at how these challenges can be addressed with their contribution
3671996 fostering a caring self reliant society that upholds human dignity
3671997 we said earlier this year that we needed to strengthen the partnership with all the stakeholders and this summit with the religious community presents us with that opportunity
3671998 the churches already have structures in place to help the needy and that is where we want to come in because they already operate in an organised manner
3671999 challenges of crime rape racism abuses and poverty and unemployment will be better addressed if we better engage churches in our society
3672000 all our districts have already laid the groundwork for such a relationship and we are confident we will make it work and deliver tangible benefits to the masses of our people
3672001 we do not have the resources to deliver the services but we are in touch with the needs of the community

3672010 the possibility of the overlap of a stupidly overt blatant kind of residue of violence with the seething or vaguely menacing vibration of the unrealized potential for violence or harm or mystery for this relationship ive tried to give the one a plastic decorative quality and exaggerate the repressed freneticism of the other i personally imagine this confrontation as a primitive fable or a cinematic fairytale at the very least and as with most of my work i hope that it would have appealed to me as a child

3672054 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3672055 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors

3672062 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol

3672073 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3672074 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3672075 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3672076 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3672077 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3672078 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3672079 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3672080 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3672081 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3672082 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3672083 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3672084 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3672085 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3672086 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3672107 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3672108 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater

3672210 the greatest moral appeal of the doctrine of the blank slate comes from a simple mathematical fact zero equals zero this allows the blank slate to serve as a guarantor of political equality blank is blank so if we are all blank slates the reasoning goes we must all be equal but if the slate of a newborn is not blank different babies could have different things inscribed on their slates individuals sexes classes and races might differ innately in their talents abilities interests and inclinations and that it is thought could lead to three evils the first is prejudice if groups of people are biologically different it could be rational to discriminate against the members of some of the groups the second is social darwinism if differences among groups in their station in life their income status and crime rate for example come from their innate constitutions the differences cannot be blamed on discrimination and that makes it easy to blame the victim and tolerate inequality the third is eugenics if people differ biologically in ways that other people value or dislike it would invite them to try to improve society by intervening biologically by encouraging or discouraging peoples decisions to have children by taking that decision out of their hands or by killing them outright the nazis carried out the final solution because they thought jews and other ethnic groups were biologically inferior the fear of the terrible consequences that might arise from a discovery of innate differences has thus led many intellectuals to insist that such differences do not exist or even that human nature does not exist because if it did innate differences would be possibly
3672211 the nazi holocaust was a singular event that changed attitudes towards countless political and scientific topics but it was not the only ideologically inspired holocaust in the twentieth century and intellectuals are only beginning to assimilate the lessons of other the mass killings in the soviet union china cambodia and other totalitarian states carried out in the name of marxism the opening of soviet archives and the release of data and memoirs on the chinese and cambodian revolutions are forcing a reevaluation of the consequences of ideology as wrenching as that following world war ii historians are currently debating whether the communists mass executions forced marches slave labour and man made famines led to one hundred million deaths or only twenty five million they are debating whether these atrocities are morally worse than the nazi holocaust or only the equivalent
3672212 and there is the remarkable fact though both nazi and marxist ideologies led to industrial scale killing their biological and psychological theories were opposites marxists had no use for the concept of race were averse to the notion of genetic inheritance and were hostile to the very idea of a human nature rooted in biology marx and engels did not explicitly embrace the doctrine of the blank slate in their writings but they were adamant that human nature has no enduring properties it consists only in the interactions of groups of people with their material environments in a historical period and constantly changes as people change their environment and are simultaneously changed by it the mind therefore has no innate structure but emerges from the dialectical processes of history and social interaction marxs twentieth century followers did embrace the blank slate or at least the related metaphor of malleable material we come across the metaphor of the blank slate in the writings of a man who may have been responsible for sixty five million deaths a blank sheet of paper has no blotches and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it the newest and most beautiful pictures can be painted on it mao zedong and we find it in a saying of a political movement that killed a quarter of its countrymen only the newborn baby is spotless khmer rouge slogan the new realization that government sponsored mass murder can come from an anti innatist belief system as easily as from an innatist one upends the postwar understanding that biological approaches to behaviour are uniquely sinister an accurate appraisal of the cause of state genocides must look for beliefs common to nazism and marxism that launched them on their parallel trajectories and for the beliefs specific to marxism that led to the unique atrocities committed in its name
3672213 the ideology of groups against group struggle explains the similar outcomes of marxism and nazism
3672214 none of this is meant to impugn the blank slate as an evil doctrine any more than a belief in human nature is an evil doctrine both are separated by great many steps from the wicked acts committed under their banners and they must be evaluated on factual grounds but it is meant to overturn the simplistic linkage of the sciences of human nature with the moral catastrophes of the twentieth century
3672215 why men earn more the startling truth behind the pay gap and what women can do about it
3672216 womens lifestyle choices partly explain their absence from certain professions especially dangerous ones

3672229 and it is now escalating into a political issue as south ossetia declared its independence from both georgia and russia
3672230 i am concerned that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3672231 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting
3672232 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3672233 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3672234 the use of force in the dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilising a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond
3672235 we had originally put our weight behind the council ceremony in the hope that would be a unified event

3672247 in countries wracked by poverty and conflict citizens long to enjoy freedom from want and since extremely poor societies and weak states provide optimal breeding grounds for disease terrorism and conflict the united states has a direct national security interest in dramatically reducing global poverty and joining with our allies in sharing more of our riches to help those most in need as president i will double our annual investment in meeting these challenges to 50 billion by 2012 and ensure that those new resources are directed toward worthwhile goals for the last 20 years foreign assistance funding has done little more than keep pace with inflation it is in our national security interest to do better

3672263 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program but i would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something and i dont think that that should be against the law and i think that its absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it it doesnt necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration i think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration that doesnt mean that we shouldnt talk to people
3672264 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
3672265 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
3672266 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
3672267 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account its a new world were in we used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy on that tragic day september the 11th 2001 we found out thats not the case we found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable and therefore we must do everything we can everything we can to secure the homeland to make us safe
3672268 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
3672269 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
3672270 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
3672271 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
3672272 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
3672273 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
3672274 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between
3672275 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
3672276 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and al

3672317 we dont know if that would be as part of russia or as a separate united ossetian state
3672318 i would prefer there to be an independent and united ossetia but today it is not possible it is safer to be with russia the main aim of the struggle is to be independent of georgia

3672321 for russia abkhazia is just a card that can be played
3672322 abkhazia is linked to russia and russia is the only country that actually cooperates with abkhazia and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption
3672323 the threat of a disintegrating russia comparable to the break up of the soviet union in 1991 is still today seen as a very real threat by the kremlin and the russian elite
3672324 the west is seen today by many in the russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear russia apart and rob it of its natural resources by supporting serbias right to veto kosovos secession the kremlin clearly believes that it is defending russias undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available

3672393 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3672394 current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic
3672395 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements

3672421 its great being back in my normal position i think we all complement each others strengths really well and with richie back we do have a good balance in the back row
3672422 the breakdown is going to be important but the loose forwards will be looking for the tight five to provide the platform if they can give us an edge its going to be make our jobs that much easier
3672423 theyre really combative arent they theyre just relentless players its not easy to knock them down but when you do they just keep getting up and coming back for more
3672424 reserve bok loose forward luke watson is also not the easiest player to cover at ruck time and apart from his skills at the breakdown hes another good ball carrier
3672425 the team that reacts best to the elvs will have an advantage and the reserves will have to adapt as soon as they come on
3672426 i think they are going to see how it does in 3 weeks and see how it responds to being immobilized and go from there
3672427 these are certain things that happen sometimes to players when you think about sometimes the bone pulling off i know that sounds kind of odd but that actually happens sometimes its not the best case scenario it certainly isnt the norm but at the same time the hard part about it is that piece of bone isnt that big its not like you can just take a screw and fix it like a fracture you cant take a little pin and just put it in there so the best thing to do is to maybe let it scar back over and see what happens to it
3672428 i told you guys at the start of the season that he was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him healthy was something we needed to do were going to miss flash somebody has to step up and do his job i know we have the people down there to do that
3672429 were in a position where we need to step it up
3672430 we need to try to see if we cant put a little bigger lead between us and the mets and the marlins weve got to win some games
3672431 were having trouble right now scoring runs through our lineup
3672432 on nights where we score a lot of runs our bottom of the lineup contributes when they dont contribute that cuts the game short
3672433 unfortunately that bony piece is attached to the ligament and the tendon
3672434 you never want to say you cant but i would say that its highly unlikely that youre going to see tom gordon pitch this year for us
3672435 he definitely was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him was something we definitely needed to do because he can go from the seventh or eighth and definitely close the game for you
3672436 were going to miss flash but somebody has to step up and do his job i know weve got the people down there to do that
3672437 i felt real good with what i did warming up i got up to where i normally would be and felt great so that gives me a good indication that im good
3672438 what can you say the last three starts have been great then you come into this one and i have the best stuff out of all those starts and get shoved what can you do
3672439 i think they are going to see how it does in 3 weeks and see how it responds to being immobilized and go from there
3672440 these are certain things that happen sometimes to players when you think about sometimes the bone pulling off i know that sounds kind of odd but that actually happens sometimes its not the best case scenario it certainly isnt the norm but at the same time the hard part about it is that piece of bone isnt that big its not like you can just take a screw and fix it like a fracture you cant take a little pin and just put it in there so the best thing to do is to maybe let it scar back over and see what happens to it

3672442 were in a position where we need to step it up
3672443 we need to try to see if we cant put a little bigger lead between us and the mets and the marlins weve got to win some games
3672444 were having trouble right now scoring runs through our lineup
3672445 on nights where we score a lot of runs our bottom of the lineup contributes when they dont contribute that cuts the game short

3672447 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3672448 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3672449 autos are the giants of energy consumption and pollution emissions and this is a major part of the effort to conserve resources and reduce emissions
3672450 the hands of the criminals have hit in tripoli against innocent soldiers and civilians
3672451 once again they want our country to be an arena for settling scores and battling for influence
3672452 the wounded were lying on the ground men in military uniforms
3672453 everybody knew him this was his place for 30 years
3672454 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3672455 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward

3672457 das ansinnen die bev lkerung dar ber zu informieren gt
3672458 auch in ihren letzten wochen kommt diese bundesregierung ber halbherzige pseudol sungen f r die dringlichsten probleme der menschen in unserem land nicht hinaus
3672459 die kehrtwendung der vp in sachen 13 monatsrate zur familienbeihilfe noch vor der wahl ist ein so durchsichtiges wie unbedachtes unterfangen
3672460 schlie lich fallen auch im vorschulalter hohe kosten an dem wird von der jetzt vorgestellten regelung aber in keinster weise rechnung getragen
3672461 wir teilen deshalb die kritik der experten die von einer unausgegorenen idee sprechen und die forderungen der fp vollinhaltlich best tigen es muss umgehend eine erh hung der familienbeihilfe f r alle kinder erfolgen und diese regelm ig inflationsangepasst werden eine 13 rate in der vorgesehenen form ist sozial unausgewogen und ungerecht die expertenschelte erfolgt zu recht und ist einigerma en peinlich f r die auf dem fundament der eigenen vers umnisse zum stimmenfang ausger ckte bundesregierung
3672462 i really do feel part of the defensive group and i really do enjoy playing down there
3672463 this year unfortunately through a few injuries ive had to be thrown all over the ground that hasnt been a bad thing
3672464 hopefully ive been able to add a little bit to the team and a little bit of versatility to my game im happy to be playing in the team in any sort of role
3672465 leo is such a fantastic player it is difficult to cover someone like that but weve adjusted quite well
3672466 theres a few different players shouldering a bit more of the load and being given a bit more responsibility to some of the younger players like heath grundy
3672467 they are very versatile in their forward line with leading players who can take a pack mark theres players who are great on the ground
3672468 theres not one player that you can actually concentrate on because they are all very dangerous
3672469 the overall spread of goalkickers makes it hard for opposition teams to match up on them
3672470 sorry youre right i had a bf all along sorry i pushed you on i really should just be happy with what i got i thought we were gonna break up so i flirted with you until it got to the point where i just fell in love with you
3672471 i would still flirt with her but i cannot be her bf until shes single again
3672472 guten morgen herr waldh usl ich bin wirklich hocherfreut dass nach der vp auch die fp endlich draufgekommen ist dass die blaulichtorganisationen unterst tzung brauchen
3672473 wenn waldh usl behauptet der landtag habe beschlossen die mittel der blaulichtorganisationen zu k rzen dann sollte er sich vielleicht einmal dar ber informieren wer der landtag ist die sp hat hier jedenfalls nicht zugestimmt
3672474 unsere forderungen liegen auf dem tisch und ich bin gerne bereit diese herrn waldh usl auch in einem pers nlichen gespr ch zu erl utern die spn fordert bereits seit jahren die rettungsstellen vom kostenbeitrag 6 60 euro pro alarmierung f r die notrufzentrale 144 notruf n entweder zur g nze zu befreien oder den rettungsstellen zumindest aus dem budget des landes einen finanziellen zuschuss in der gleichen h he zukommen zu lassen
3672475 eine unterst tzung w re die von der sp seit jahren geforderte abschaffung der mehrwertsteuer beim ankauf von fahrzeugen und ger tschaften aber auch ein zweckgebundener anteil f r das feuerwehrwesen aus der mineral lsteuer w re denkbar f r die sp w ren hier f nf prozent eine wirkungsvolle hilfe die der finanzminister aufgrund der ohnehin massiv gestiegenen einnahmen aus der mineral lsteuer wohl leicht verkraften k nnte
3672476 wenn sich die fp erinnert wird ihr einfallen dass gerade das sozial nicht ausgewogene landesbudget ein grund war warum die sp n diesem nicht zugestimmt hat
3672477 hier also der sp vorw rfe zu machen ist nichts anderes als der versuch in wahlkampfzeiten politisches kleingeld zu machen
3672478 yes apart from a lingering ache you dont tend to move on until you get a chance to perform again
3672479 it was a very good performance by the all blacks and there were elements that we werent proud of or happy with but its not the end its not terminal
3672480 theres likely to be some adjustments i dont know what they are fully yet myself
3672481 he is quite a positive person and i think its rubbing off on the boys it was a pretty positive camp this morning and we put it behind us
3672482 it was a bit of a freak accident it was supposed to be an eight week injury but it has turned into a four week injury with surgery
3672483 i will only miss one game so im pretty fortunate
3672484 das gestern im ministerrat beschlossene pflegepaket erf llt wichtige seniorenbundforderungen
3672485 die jetzige einigung im ministerrat erf llt wichtige seniorenbundforderungen die unabh ngig von der wahlauseinandersetzung erfolgt ist die vernunft hat gesiegt
3672486 ich halte aber an der zielsetzung fest dass sobald leistbar die h heren stufen 6 und 7 f r die pflege und betreuung von personen noch st rker zu erh hen sind stellt khol klar

3672502 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits

3672513 we are very pleased that our rack and pinion railway that we first presented to the specialist public last november has convinced our customers in a very short time

3672517 the return of the jewish people to the land of israel is an integral part of what israel stands for
3672518 we dont know if it will be hundreds or dozens

3672567 the charge is for posting packing and handling neither the mailer the bubble wrap protector or my time in wrapping it petrol for driving to the post office time spent standing in the post office queue come for free unfortunately 1 50 is a fairly standard and perfectly reasonable charge for 1st class cd postage on ebay within the uk im sorry if you think it was excessive as a gesture of good faith let me know what you think i should have charged and ill refund the difference
3672568 its in the book for 8 back in the real world there are
3672569 this data is a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime
3672570 communications data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3672571 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest
3672572 many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data
3672573 yet again the government has proved itself unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3672574 ministers have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seem intent on pressing ahead with this snoopers charter
3672575 this incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board
3672576 our overall control framework remains sound and we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review
3672577 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks
3672578 golf is like an eighteen year old girl with big boobs you know its wrong but you cant keep away from her
3672579 golf is a lot of walking broken up by disappointment and bad arithmetic
3672580 golf is a day spent in a round of strenuous idleness
3672581 fifty years ago 100 white men chasing one black man across a field was called the ku klux klan today its called the pga tour
3672582 i regard golf as an expensive way of playing marbles
3672583 incomprehensible masochism worse than any circle of hell imagined by dante
3672584 there is every reason to think that london is currently below its economically optimal size and that it is capable of generating many more jobs
3672585 if it did so by attracting people from our regeneration cities then it could transform their lives
3672586 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3672587 although no one wants to see suburbia expand it is hard to believe that it would greatly reduce the standard of living of those who currently live in london it would take us one extra minute to leave the city and reach the countryside but doing so would transform the lives of a million people who were then able to move from some of britains least successful places
3672588 the headmaster having had a mere three weeks to campaign had done so on the simple slogan

3672592 everyone i know in england is convinced that arsenal will go through so there is no pressure on our players
3672593 we have to go into the match relaxed with the belief we can we win but also enjoy it because its arsenal its the champions league for the first time in the clubs history so it is a momentous occasion
3672594 i just dont know how many times you can do this
3672595 to be 10 runs down to come back to take the lead and then to lose its just too mentally and physically draining it gets old
3672596 the independence and effectiveness of external audits in new jersey cannot be trusted unless changes are made
3672597 auditors probably shouldnt be in the business of writing checks in campaign season
3672598 these are professionals and we feel they do a very very good job
3672599 you need to have an auditor who is independent and has the right incentives to scrutinize the units books and records and not an audit firm thats focused purely on maintaining the contractual relationship for as long a term as possible
3672600 it probably is a good idea to have a new set of eyes looking at your books
3672601 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
3672602 the best thing to do was get rid of them
3672603 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
3672604 if the definition of a puppy mill is putting profits over care of the dogs this is a stark example of doing that
3672605 there are others ways to take care of the situation like in a court
3672606 he could have treated the dogs with medication for 40 or 50
3672607 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs

3672610 apparently on the internet my baby has been named indiana rose i dont know where that came from but i guess that can be it for now until we decide on a name
3672611 at 115 a barrel we see the industry turning a profit in 2009
3672612 if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
3672613 this isnt the same industry that gave us pause last march
3672614 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines
3672615 significant fall in oil prices has given airlines substantial breathing room even if demand does weaken
3672616 we look at the companies ability to pay their obligations their creditworthiness we still think airlines are fragile and they are burning through cash
3672617 its not outrageous to suggest that whats already been done may be enough to get the industry profitable in 2009
3672618 shes managed to come up with a fragrance thats quite delightful
3672619 i used to love to watch my grandmother put on her perfume
3672620 shed blot a little dab behind her ears it was such a classy ritual
3672621 these fragrances are more than doubling in volume while the market is declining
3672622 they are doing a good job at attracting the trendsetter customer who is looking to try out different things
3672623 there is a real passionate person out there who buys a lot of fragrances and knows when everything is out before it actually comes out
3672624 i have an overly sensitive nose and i dont like most scents
3672625 but this i really like its light it smells fresh its like it belongs on me
3672626 she had a very precise idea about the notes in her perfume
3672627 the fragrance she asked me to make was in a completely different range of my usual creations
3672628 i always wanted to do something on my own but i didnt believe that this passion would become a business
3672629 a recent survey of people who had received big settlements in personal injury cases showed more than half who took the lump sum payment had already spent the entire amount at the time of the survey
3672630 do you need a lump sum of money this is the primary indicator that it is time to sell a structured settlement
3672631 that 35 percent of americans with no knowledge of structured settlements would take the lump sum but after learning the merits of structured settlements 73 percent of them preferred the lifetime payments
3672632 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
3672633 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
3672634 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3672635 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3672636 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3672637 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3672638 its ridiculous to talk about that number because there were so many changes made on that ship
3672639 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3672640 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3672641 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3672642 will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
3672643 because the circumstances around the sec emergency order were so unusual im not sure we can gather any real lessons from trading activity during this period
3672644 i think theres curiosity about whether there will be any changes in trading but i havent heard any specific concerns

3672648 in effect the brokerage company could have hired 100 convicted felons that committed fraud and that was ok
3672649 new jersey also requires lenders and brokers to register their loan officers and solicitors however the solicitors did not have to pass a test
3672650 mortgage referral agents think twice about having consumers accept or buy into predatory loans
3672651 even before the crisis occurred but harrisburg failed to act
3672652 there were some bad mortgage brokers just as there are some bad people in every industry
3672653 becoming a mortgage originator was too easy pay the fee fill out the paperwork and you could start originating loans
3672654 the law is a welcome change that will weed out many of the bad originators
3672655 i think it is about time that licensing has been addressed
3672656 every loan officer should need to comply with certain standards to conduct business
3672657 with the changes in the law the brokers association is changing membership levels
3672658 there will now be brokers and originators with originators paying a reduced fee but have the same services from the association as the broker
3672659 put your pride aside and get help a lot of people are not taking steps needed to avert foreclosure until it is too late its more difficult to overturn a foreclosure than avert one
3672660 the more severe their slowdown the greater the likelihood that it will begin to cool the boom in exports

3672667 we are looking into new areas and different projects in kerala we have already identified some projects which we will be developing in the future
3672668 currently we are talking to land owners to acquire land but nothing has been finalised yet
3672669 we are looking to develop about 15 projects in these five new cities with over 100 acres of land in total

3672671 is faring far better than the u s as a whole
3672672 of the 165 markets we track philadelphia performed better than 117 of them
3672673 because home values in the area arent dropping as significantly homeowners are holding on to more value and less are slipping into negative equity situations
3672674 while this may seem high on a national level almost one in three are in these situations
3672675 the longer this goes on the more homes that come on the market as people who have put off trying to sell because of the soft market finally decide to try their luck
3672676 als een vrouw mij verleidt is dat ook een vorm van seksuele intimidatie
3672677 door al die nieuwe media gaan de publieke zeden er alleen maar op achteruit
3672678 i think the u s women look healthy not decrepit like some gymnasts used to look because of eating disorders and those type of things
3672679 its nice to see gymnasts finally looking like young women not children
3672680 they are living training and breathing in the training camp and sure thats efficient but the world is moving forward
3672681 i wouldnt give it another olympic cycle i think this type of preparation will be eliminated forever even in a place like china
3672682 can you imagine if we plucked our girls out of their homes when they were 5 or 6 then kept them and trained them never let them go home
3672683 in america that just would not happen never wed have a hundred lawyers knocking on our door because it does not work that way for us this system works the best
3672684 its great because seeing the other girls kind of pushes you to work harder when you go home
3672685 for me its perfect because if youd have to live at a training center i kind of think youd end up one dimensional
3672686 gymnastics is a big part of my life but certainly not everything in my life

3672695 once again they want our country to be an arena for settling scores and battling for influence
3672696 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent

3672706 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3672707 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3672708 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3672709 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3672710 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3672711 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3672712 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3672713 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3672714 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3672715 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3672716 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3672717 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3672718 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3672719 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3672756 de manier waarop martin cahill zijn gestolen meesterwerken gebruikte om aan geld drugs en uiteindelijk wapens te geraken is een schoolvoorbeeld van hoe de georganiseerde misdaad kunstdiefstal in haar manier van werken integreert
3672757 cahill was van plan om de vermeer later opnieuw als onderpand voor een lening te gebruiken maar zover is het nooit gekomen want hij werd gearresteerd het schilderij van metsu werd in istanboel teruggevonden door de turkse politie op het moment dat het geruild zou worden voor een lading wapens
3672758 dat heb ik allemaal te danken aan mijn roman the art thief
3672759 ik wou een roman schrijven die zich afspeelt achter de schermen van de kunstwereld als academicus ben ik erg gehecht aan degelijk onderzoek toen ik voor de roman begon te researchen ontdekte ik dat er bedroevend weinig studiemateriaal over kunstcriminaliteit voorhanden is er is veel informatie over zwendel met antiek en over het inpikken van kunst tijdens oorlogen maar ik vond niets over vervalsing en diefstal tijdens periodes van vrede ik zag een gigantisch gat in de markt ben erin gesprongen en begon een paar jaar geleden als allereerste met een academische ingesteldheid kunstcriminaliteit te bestuderen vorig jaar heb ik de onafhankelijke organisatie arca association for research into crimes against art opgericht vanaf de start van mijn onderzoek verwachtte ik dat er elk moment een stokoude professor met een lange grijze baard zou opduiken om me terecht te wijzen hey noah snotneus wat ben je van plan ik bestudeer dit al vijftig jaar maar het is oorverdovend stil gebleven
3672760 na drugs en wapenhandel volgt de aan kunst gerelateerde criminaliteit de jaarlijkse opbrengst zou zes miljard dollar bedragen al vrees ik dat het werkelijke cijfer veel hoger ligt want die zes miljard is gebaseerd op bij de politie aangegeven diefstallen elk jaar zijn er honderdduizenden incidenten die gelinkt zijn aan kunstcriminaliteit de media focussen jaarlijks op een paar spectaculaire kunstroven uit musea terwijl er ondertussen duizenden andere grotere en minder grotere vormen van kunstzwendel plaatsvinden schilderkunst is populair bij misdaadsyndicaten omdat schilderijen gemakkelijk transporteerbare waardevolle objecten zijn sinds het begin van de zestiger jaren zijn bijna alle kunstmisdrijven toe te schrijven aan die misdaadsyndicaten als je als individuele crimineel een bekend werk steelt riskeer je om tegen de lamp te lopen op het moment dat je het probeert te verkopen als het je toch lukt zal je het werk nooit voor meer dan 10 van de geschatte waarde kunnen slijten maar de kans dat je een koper vindt is zo goed als nihil want wie een bekend gestolen werk koopt kan er nooit mee uitpakken en moet het in een ruimte hangen waar hij als enige toegang toe heeft misdaadorganisaties werken veeleer zoals martin cahill ze stelen bekende werken om ze dienst te laten doen als onderpand of als ruilmiddel om aan wapens of drugs te geraken minder bekende gestolen kunstwaar verkopen ze op de grijze markt in leegstaande panden op geheime adressen aan die kunstliefhebbers die in iets heel speciaal ge nteresseerd zijn
3672761 in deze misdaadtak heeft de fantasie de werkelijkheid zwaar be nvloed
3672762 wacht tot je hen leert kennen de meeste mensen uit het wereldje zijn larger than life je gelooft je eigen ogen en oren niet als je hen voor het eerst ontmoet het zijn fascinerende weirdos ik heb de karakters in mijn boek zelfs moeten afvlakken anders zouden ze veel te ongeloofwaardig overgekomen zijn de totaal geschifte kunstexpert uit mijn boek professor barrow is een combinatie van drie professoren kunstgeschiedenis die ik als student zelf in cambridge gehad heb
3672763 jammer genoeg zijn er zeer veel experts met zeer weinig scrupules actief in de kunstwereld ze staan heel sterk want het is bijna onmogelijk om hen te betrappen als een door hen gekeurd en voor echt verklaard schilderij later een vervalsing blijkt te zijn kunnen ze altijd beweren dat ze zich vergist hebben of dat ze verkeerd geciteerd zijn de kunstwereld is een bizarre economische sector waar het woord van n expert vaak miljoenen waard is ik denk niet dat er nog andere sectoren bestaan waarin uitspraken van een handvol experts het verschil maken tussen winst en verlies en waarin de waarde van de verhandelde goederen even amateuristisch en arbitrair wordt vastgelegd de scheidslijn tussen oplichting en legitimiteit is er flinterdun
3672764 no way van een kunstwerk uit de zestiende eeuw geschilderd door een groot artiest kunnen we aannemen dat het veel geld waard moet zijn maar van de prijs van sommige hedendaagse kunstwerken kunnen we ons dat al veel minder voorstellen de waarde van kunst of de schattingen door experts zijn nattevingerwerk er bestaat een specifieke formule om de waarde van een kunstwerk te bepalen de waarde is gelijk aan de aangenomen zeldzaamheid plus de aangenomen authenticiteit aangenomen is belangrijk want als jij als expert gelooft dat een schilderij origineel is en alle andere mensen geloven dat samen met jou dan zal het origineel zijn ook al is het dat in de realiteit niet in het frick museum in new york hangt de poolse ruiter van rembrandt als je aan tien kunsthistorici vraagt wat ze van het doek vinden zal de helft antwoorden dat het een van rembrandts grootste meesterwerken is de andere helft zal zeggen dat het waarschijnlijk niet door de meester zelf geschilderd is maar door een van zijn studenten die rembrandt is juist een van de redenen waarom mensen het frick bezoeken het museum heeft er dan ook alle belang bij om te blijven propageren dat het een echte rembrandt is anders wordt het doek misschien maar een tiende waard van wat het nu geschat wordt voor het frick is het van levensbelang dat ze experts blijven vinden die stellen dit is een echte rembrandt en het is een van zijn absolute meesterwerken daarom ook valt de kunstwereld zo vaak met haar ogen wijd open in vallen die gelegd zijn door slimme criminelen want iedereen in de kunstwereld wordt er alleen maar beter van als een werk als legitiem en authentiek bestempeld kan worden en ze verliezen allemaal als het gestolen of vervalst blijkt te zijn
3672765 ze houden zich op de vlakte als het eropaan komt om bij twijfel de authenticiteit of de criminele achtergrond van een werk na te trekken
3672766 ze doen er alles aan om vooral niets op het spoor te komen want bij kunstfraude zijn zij de eersten die verliezen ze vertrouwen de verkopers blindelings en schuiven de verantwoordelijkheid in de schoenen van hun cli nteel elke cli nt moet zelf maar uitzoeken of het werk dat hij wil kopen clean is je kan er dus vergif op innemen dat christies en sothebys veel kunst met een criminele geschiedenis verkopen de veilinghuizen checken alleen of de objecten die geveild worden op het art loss register voorkomen het register is wereldwijd de grootste databank van gestolen kunst er zitten 160 000 objecten in wat maar een minieme fractie is van alle diefstallen sothebys en christies gebruiken het art loss register om achteraf hun handen in onschuld te kunnen wassen gehaaide criminelen gebruiken de veilinghuizen dan weer om hun gestolen goed wit te wassen het enige wat je als dief moet doen is checken of het kunstwerk op het art loss register staat als dat niet zo is laat je het door christies of sothebys veilen en laat je het kopen door een van je stromannen na de verkoop schrijft het veilinghuis een attest uit waardoor jouw stroman jij dus de gelegitimeerde eigenaar wordt van het werk zo cre er je voor je gestolen schilderij een nieuwe plaats van herkomst die je kan gebruiken om het elders voor veel geld te verkopen
3672767 no one can be complacent in this competition at any time i think this years air new zealand cup will be the closest we have seen
3672768 its going to be pretty close who would have ever thought there would only two unbeaten teams wellington and bay of plenty after two rounds
3672769 maybe us beating manawatu will be the upset this week in some peoples minds
3672770 hes blocking me we went to the ground its football it happens off the field were friends on the field its a competition
3672771 i am extremely surprised because of the fact that i know the injury he had
3672772 sometimes you see him out there he looks like he is walking at 90 percent and all of a sudden hes in the game and playing at 100 percent great for j r
3672773 i kind of invented a brace it took me two years to get used to it but now i just play football i was determined to play it came down to hard work and believing in yourself when no one else did
3672774 eventually when im done playing im going to patent it
3672775 i finally landed back here which is a good place but its been a roller coaster
3672776 i made some mental errors here and there but everybody does you try to improve from there i want to start i know weve got a whole bunch of safeties but i want to start sometime i started three last year never know what could happen
3672777 i feel comfortable here its a very complicated defense but thats what i like about it youve got to be able to think a little bit you have to have smart safeties i think i can still play in this game
3672778 hes led this team to a super bowl went to the nfc championship a couple times so he definitely knows what hes doing and hes put a good program together
3672779 we feel like weve got a few guys who can get it done
3672780 we brought booker in we brought jamal jones in whos another good kick returner there of course weve got j r reed and weve got buck correll buckhalter desean is going to get some kick returns at some point
3672781 thats important having all five guys playing together with many reps because its critical that they play well together as a unit
3672782 ska man bli s d r r d i ansiktet
3672783 im not allowed to discuss the condition of my injuries
3672784 i think thats something that youve got to talk to coach childress about or the trainers
3672785 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3672786 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him
3672787 nah i dont think so sheppard said when asked yesterday if this would be a problem for him
3672788 well yeah samuel said yesterday in his long delayed first media session of training camp when asked if he understood what sheppard is going through
3672789 we talk about it being that i went through a situation last year so i can give him my pointers and my opinion on the whole situation we can relate to that definitely
3672790 we have a real good relationship samuel said of sheppard
3672791 my first year up here he kind of shows me the ropes sheldon does too were all pretty tight its a good relationship its no bad blood with anybody a situation is a situation and everybody goes through a situation but that doesnt affect us we go out there weve got a job to do
3672792 im a competitor at heart i love to compete samuel said
3672793 when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there
3672794 i think hes learning it and picking it up as expected sheppard said of samuel
3672795 but weve still got a couple weeks before the season gets started hes still got a lot to learn and a lot of time to improve
3672796 i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together brown said
3672797 all that will take care of itself when it needs to be taken care of
3672798 as much as possible he said he trusts the coaches to balance the healing of his hamstring against the need for familiarity
3672799 he said what he had to say brown said of sheppard who last week was critical of team owner luries contention that lito needs to improve his ypa or yards per pass attempt against him
3672800 a lot of unity out here a lot of unity a lot of love
3672801 i can feel the love and i can feel excitement he said
3672802 you know theyre talking mess and talking crud i definitely feel that they want to see me out there and see what i can do for the team
3672803 i dont want this year to be hampering me with injuries and stuff like that so that was the first thought that came into my head but i should be beyond that now
3672804 last year i missed all of training camp and came out and had a pretty good year
3672805 ive been dealing with adversity since ive been in the nfl
3672806 i give him some pointers and my opinion on the whole situation
3672807 we can relate to that definitely we have a good relationship my first year here he kind of has shown me the ropes sheldon brown too were all pretty tight
3672808 you dont know how many reps were going to get
3672809 im anxious to see us play a whole game i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together
3672810 like ive said this is not the time to be talking about whos on the field and whos not on the field were getting ready to go into the season and if were going to go into the season and try to win and seriously be committed to doing it youre going to have to push your ego aside for a year
3672811 i love to compete when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there if my brothers are out there and im not out there its kind of frustrating but im back and feeling good
3672812 definitely i should have made that interception hands down nine times out of 10 i never miss that play but one play doesnt make a game we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
3672813 people can say whatever they want like i said one play doesnt make a game whoever said things im sure they had a couple messed up plays that had an effect on the game

3672839 30 also in a farewell to arms the nurse dies instead of running off hemingway depicts his wartime love story in this fashion for reasons that are more internal than just attracting the reader by writing it off as just a fling he consoles himself about his lost love as for ms barkley dying in the novel this could show spite or resentment towards the real life nurse for breaking his heart hemingway also utilizes henry as a way to express his political views several times in a farewell to arms henry expresses his views on the war he says thing like

3672854 are you going to become that girl or that girl
3672855 we took a hard look at general motors and we wanted to show our confidence in general motors
3672856 we firmly believe in gm and that we have the best products to sell our fuel economy is the best story in the industry and the best way to do it was to buy an investment stock
3672857 there wasnt one person on that call that didnt agree it was a great idea to show gm the confidence we have in them and that it was a great opportunity to bolster our position with gm stock
3672858 we want them to know the confidence their dealer council as a group has in gm and to let them know that its a great investment for other dealers
3672859 we will have v 8s for those who want them and well have v 6s that get great fuel economy
3672860 it will be a third car for some and an everyday driver for others its going to be such a fashion statement and theres a lot of pent up demand for a car like this
3672861 its not just a mustang fighter well have a big price spread and camaro will have wide appeal outside that segment
3672862 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
3672863 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
3672864 at first blush these would be positive steps for liquidity but we would view them as absolute necessities given the current market conditions
3672865 overall we believe that the cost cutting is ahead of market expectations and relatively credible while the fundraising provides less up front cash than we and the market had been looking for
3672866 since the first of this year our progress has been threatened as u s economic conditions that have become increasingly more difficult
3672867 we are having a tough time getting clarity in our crystal ball
3672868 gm is certainly going to be looking to bring a higher number of fuel efficient vehicles to the u s
3672869 they have some good small car products in south korea and in south america that they could bring here sooner
3672870 gmac is taking steps to align its financing program to changing market conditions
3672871 these steps include suspending incentivized leasing in canada reducing the volume of new lease originations in the u s discontinuing the smartbuy balloon contract program and increasing our pricing on other lending activities such as wholesale dealer financing
3672872 difficult actions for both gmac and our dealer customers but they are necessary to help preserve the availability of competitive financing options offered by gmac now and in the future
3672873 its difficult to pass these costs on to your customer
3672874 gmac was the last one to do any adjustments to any program and when things improve theyll be the first ones to reduce the costs they always are my guess is theyll stay in leasing but itll be more expensive
3672875 we saved our money dont get me wrong but what happens if you cant get good care
3672876 we know that gm is going through hard times now common sense tells you that but by cutting us off like they did giving us just 300 a month its not nearly going to compensate what weve got to pay
3672877 our sole function is to provide world class information free of any noise and pressure
3672878 the untold story is that over time any group retiree plan becomes very large very expensive and very unwieldy and they passed costs on to retirees for many years

3672884 thats what the russians were trying to say forget the notion that georgia is a safe transit point
3672885 but whos going to invest 10 billion in the nabucco pipeline when the russians can shut it off whenever they want
3672886 but to say it had nothing at all to do with oil is ridiculous
3672887 i think it speaks to the economic climate that these teams are dealing with
3672888 what mightve made sense at 8 to 12 million becomes a difficult equation at 16 to 20 million because you arent necessarily selling more product just because the racing has gotten more expensive
3672889 we try to be very clear it is just promotional images that theyre receiving
3672890 starting faceted search 2 5 the solution relies on microsoft enterprise library to address common software requirements in caching logging exception handling policy injection etc etc more importantly the 2 5 is a ground breaking release that is setting new targets for the faceted search
3672891 the solution uses 2 mechanisms for manageable cache quick and long i built the caching logic on assumption that user knows what he she is looking for the search facets web part will cache original result set and use it for the search refinement paging and other postbacks if the initial result set doesnt provide full coverage of the search the smart 2nd thread will run against real time data providing adjustment to the cached match
3672892 at the present we are looking at ajax and silverlight and hopefully youll start seeing more and more power of facets in the near future

3672897 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and broadly flat but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through the adjustment
3672898 the sense is that with the chart showing inflation below the target in two years time it opens the door for a rate cut
3672899 the housing market is weaker and credit supply conditions are tightened by more than was assumed in may

3672905 van tevoren wisten we al dat het raceweekend in brno moeilijk zou worden want met mijn seat leon met benzinemotor ben ik daar in het nadeel ten opzichte van de achterwielaandrijvers en de diesels zoals in de afgelopen jaren al wel duidelijk werd
3672906 ik had van tevoren al gezegd dat er waarschijnlijk niet meer dan een vijftiende plek in zou zitten en zo was het dus ook
3672907 daarna zat ik een tijd vast achter rydell die een beetje begon te duwen
3672908 ik heb voorzichtig gereden wilde geen onnodige risicos nemen maar heb wel een paar plaatsen kunnen winnen het dieptepunt was echter dat nicola larini me er in de laatste ronde in de hairpin afzette geen idee waarom een volledig onnodige actie mijn auto was wel flink kapot zodat het team in ieder geval meer tijd nodig had dan de tijd die normaal gesproken wordt toegestaan dat betekende dat ik de volgende race achteraan moest starten
3672909 ik heb zo voorzichtig mogelijk geprobeerd plaatsen goed te maken maar heel veel kansen had ik niet meer dan de dertiende plaats zat er gewoon niet in
3672910 we hadden gepland dat ik tegen het einde van de training nog n keer binnen zou komen voor een verse set banden maar we waren net een paar seconden te laat waardoor ik geen vliegende ronde meer kon rijden jammer maar kan gebeuren
3672911 daarbij kon ik vooral profiteren van de gevechten van mensen voor me die flink met elkaar aan het bakkeleien waren en soms van de baan raakten
3672912 ik had onder andere een leuk duel met alain menu
3672913 op weg naar de grid merkte ik dat de koppeling het niet deed ik waarschuwde het team en in de startopstelling hebben de monteurs nog geprobeerd om de koppeling te ontluchten helaas zonder resultaat na een paar meter was het voor mij over
3672914 dat is alles wat erin zat sneller kon ik gewoon niet
3672915 de start achter de safety car was een volkomen terechte beslissing want je kon echt geen hand voor ogen zien het was voor mij een leuke race waarin ik een aantal mensen heb weten in te halen en zo wat plaatsen heb kunnen winnen
3672916 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3672917 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3672918 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3672919 to err is human but to really foul things up you need a computer
3672920 he had a badly broken nose there was blood coming from his nose and mouth the skin on one side of his face had been torn away to reveal the flesh beneath
3672921 there were severe patches of bruising over all of his body the skin on his wrists had been torn off and the skin on his forehead torn away and there was no skin under his eyes either

3672924 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3672925 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

3672939 when eyes meet across a crowded room looks obviously count first in determining who we find attractive but smell is an important sense for us we are animals after all smell kicks in more in maintaining a relationship it may not affect who you are attracted to in a crowded bar but it may determine how you feel about them next morning

3672965 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3672966 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3672967 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat

3672972 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3672973 the combination of outside ins new radar feature and fire eagles amazingly simple and powerful api means that our users can now see all the news and buzz within 1 000 feet of their current location updated from any number of applications and devices
3672974 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3672975 pownce users can now say where they are and geotag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
3672976 wouldnt that make a great soundtrack for a david lynch movie

3672987 were all getting together at my house on tuesday and everybody jumps on a train and is there in ten minutes there more to it than that
3672988 what suit did you buy today to wear to this interview
3672989 we conveyed our willingness to raise our offer to 33 00 per share reflecting again our belief in this collective opportunity this increase would have added approximately another 5 billion of value to your shareholders compared to the current value of our initial offer it also would have reflected a premium of over 70 percent compared to the price at which your stock closed on january 31 yet it has proven insufficient as your final position insisted on microsoft paying yet another 5 billion or more or at least another 4 per share above our 33 00 offer
3672990 from the beginning of this process our independent board and our management have been steadfast in our belief that microsofts offer undervalued the company and we are pleased that so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view yahoo is profitable growing and executing well on its strategic plan to capture the large opportunities in the relatively young online advertising market our solid results for the first quarter of 2008 and increased full year 2008 operating cash flow outlook reflect the progress the company is making
3672991 as you can imagine weve been on a very sharp learning curve
3672992 were getting the knack of building them it takes a lot less time not only to assemble the ships but to test them
3672993 the waterfront crew was able to fire 12 dummy torpedoes the same size shape and weight as the torpedoes that will be used
3672994 we fired 12 simulated torpedoes and we had 12 consecutive successful launches
3672995 this ship absolutely hit all the marks it was supposed to its the best one yet its firing on all cylinders
3672996 when you buy a new car you want to go on a test drive you want to make sure everything works from power steering to the engine to the radio you want to make sure all the knobs are where theyre supposed to be
3672997 the navy is taking the boat out with that same thought in mind

3673000 and i enjoy sharing and learning right along with the students
3673001 i teach with a lot of levity we have fun we have a good time
3673002 all too often innocent law abiding people suffer tragic consequences and the loss of loved ones due to this careless disregard for human life
3673003 well be especially vigilant during high risk nighttime hours when impaired drivers are most likely to be on the road
3673004 basically if you dont make 50 000 to 60 000 a year its going to be difficult for you to purchase a home under this ordinance
3673005 a teacher making 33 000 a year could start with a rental and then move into a townhouse and finally a home as her income increases
3673006 but currently deerfield place for instance is more dense than would be allowed under this ordinance
3673007 when i first saw the wet spot on the floor

3673009 we have been extremely pleased with every amenity and service that the very competent staff of the yha has provided us
3673010 before you include yorkshire commons in your praise you all need to have some facts
3673011 i fear that if york housing authority is in charge of this affordable work force housing if it ever comes to york yorkshire commons will become the slums of york can and could manager and management handle all of the complexes adequately
3673012 i thought it was something they could take care of
3673013 i do wish the housing authority were more attentive to the residents for which it is already responsible
3673014 we do an annual inspection we see every unit every spring
3673015 we inspect every year every year for the last several years it has been rated good
3673016 we pick random units and inspect for safety violations such as tripping hazards electrical outlets its a pretty comprehensive inspection
3673017 i called the maintenance man and he came to change the bulb he hands me a 100 watt bulb for a fixture rated for 60 watts
3673018 if i think there is something over there that needs attention well be all over it
3673019 we are very lucky to have this much senior housing in this size town

3673028 people want a change in the way the federal government works
3673029 this election is a chance to change the future of the state the country up and down the ballot
3673030 a surf contest does not necessarily warrant an expanded area
3673031 it doesnt affect them because they send the competitors out in heats of about six people at a time
3673032 i think its a great event the surfers have abided by what we want we gave them a recommendation that anytime they want to have a special event they have to go through the special event application process
3673033 as we said the last time we presented to you this is a plan that weve met with the neighborhood group and took their input and comments
3673034 i believe that at this time we have the support of the neighbors
3673035 this is the design we chose this is the one we like very much this now has a turning lane from old post to ridge so that the people turning do not get into the other lane and that outcropping will prevent speeders from going up the hill
3673036 i recommend that we sharpen our pencil as much as possible i dont know if you really need that high a number
3673037 it is important for us that we get together as a community to discuss ideas on how to weather the energy crisis

3673098 the police officers at the scene arrived to find the defendant slumped over his steering wheel
3673099 they could smell the alcohol on his breath so he was asked to go to the police vehicle with them
3673100 he was clearly drunk so the police officers removed the keys from the ignition
3673101 the defendant then started to urinate through open trousers he was arrested at that point
3673102 he could not recall which lay by he had stopped in or how he had got there
3673103 he could not recall being arrested or how he got into that situation
3673104 his wife and daughter had left him his marriage had broken down irretrievably he then hit the bottle
3673105 he is a sales manager with a good income but clearly that is all in jeopardy because of this decision he has made
3673106 our club enjoys a positive relationship with northumbria police and we work together with them to ensure the effective safety management of matches at the stadium of light
3673107 if we have to take officers away from them communities to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community

3673113 this year because of our increased workload we asked for additional funding
3673114 this has allowed us to increase the number of scheduled transplants from about 19 a year to 28

3673116 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3673117 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3673118 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3673119 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3673120 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3673121 pas should support anwar even though we are hardly similar in political ideology
3673122 whenever pas has been in a coalition with other parties it has fared well in elections
3673123 so pas needs anwar if it wants to do well outside of the malay heartland and that the party members cannot deny
3673124 the opposition offers more possibilities because it is very new if they win there could be opportunities for pas like getting ministerial posts for islamic affairs
3673125 political risk has become a major problem in malaysia and has the potential to destabilise the nation

3673133 to mattys credit he has really stepped up his game and people realize that hes not justin and hes actually a very talented musician with a great voice and if it werent for that we might have been done
3673134 for us its actually been a positive turning point i think our songs are stronger and to be honest as a band we get along better and i think its coming through in the music nothing was faked or forced with this album or in this band were stoked to play music for a living and were really proud of what weve done
3673135 were trying to find out who we can bribe to get on the radio here but its not working
3673136 overseas theyve picked up on this album and were hoping it works out for us in the states so i can stop looting you know how embarrassing it is when everyone knows its you and you still do it when your picture is hanging up in every best buy

3673141 up to now it has often been a challenge for check in personnel and passengers to keep current about what documents are needed for travelling abroad

3673157 till that the issue of tawang is settled whatever else we may do it is difficult to say we have crossed the rubicon
3673158 when they the chinese talk in terms of movement forward they keep arguing tawang has always been a part of tibet which is a matter of debate
3673159 tawang is an area with substantial settled populations not a small number it flies in the face of guiding principles and political parameters for china to demand it how we work out whether i have the ingenuity or mr dai bingguo the chinese special representative has the flexibility we will see

3673226 we unfortunately had a previously scheduled commitment on the date proposed
3673227 the study leads me to think we really havent done our job
3673228 our job was not to hand it off to the budget committee or to leave it for the legislature to decide our job was to make recommendations on these key items im feeling more like rather than deal with these issues and make helpful recommendations weve sort of thrown our hands up and said oh these are too complicated too controversial or worst of all they are too expensive so weve done little really
3673229 can we have one of our learned attorneys address that

3673235 i believe that the price drop is even greater than the median prices are showing
3673236 if your house is 3 percent larger and youre getting a 3 percent drop in price its a 6 percent drop in real prices
3673237 prices may fall a little bit more but i think were awfully close to the bottom
3673238 well bump along the bottom for a while but i dont think well see the decline we saw this year

3673248 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3673249 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3673250 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3673251 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3673252 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3673253 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3673254 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3673260 they are trying to replicate an amazon rain forest in their backyard
3673261 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3673262 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3673263 i finally realized if i dont have my health i have nothing
3673264 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
3673265 only about one fourth of all medical schools in the us require medical students to take even one nutrition course less than half of medical programs even provide an elective nutrition course students in such classes receive less than twenty total hours of nutrition education an amount they themselves consider inadequate
3673266 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
3673267 i believe someone should fall in love with it to spend that much money
3673268 things will turn around after the first of the year
3673269 mum why are they shooting dont they know that the olympics start tomorrow why doesnt anyone tell them that there should be no fighting during the olympics

3673271 how long will the bombing last let us raise our hands and surrender before they have killed us all it looks like russia has forgotten us
3673272 it will heal by the time you have your wedding
3673273 i wish they would strike gori and tbilisi i want nothing more
3673274 georgian tanks are already in town itll be hard without the russians
3673275 help me what shall i do i am georgian i worked here in tskhinval i am a worker where shall i go

3673277 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
3673278 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3673279 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3673280 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3673281 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3673282 this markets got good employment good interest rates and availability of product nobody has a crystal ball but when it turns it will turn on a dime
3673283 i wouldnt believe anything a realtor says unless they have data
3673284 you cant just say the market has hit bottom based on a feeling
3673285 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3673286 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3673287 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3673288 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3673289 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3673290 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3673291 i came expecting to watch phil play golf and i ended up getting his tickets to the super bowl
3673292 i thought it would be fun to give it to a father son
3673293 i cherish the time i have with each one of my kids and i thought it would be a cool experience for them
3673294 just under 4 miles to go thats not far just pace yourself and youll make it
3673295 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3673296 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3673297 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3673298 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3673299 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3673300 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3673301 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3673302 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3673303 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3673304 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3673305 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3673306 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3673307 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3673308 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3673309 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3673310 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3673311 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3673312 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3673313 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3673314 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3673315 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3673316 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3673317 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3673318 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3673319 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3673320 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3673321 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3673322 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3673323 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3673324 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3673325 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3673326 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3673327 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3673328 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3673329 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3673330 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3673331 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3673332 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3673333 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3673334 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3673335 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3673336 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3673337 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3673338 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3673339 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3673340 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3673341 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3673342 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3673343 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3673344 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3673345 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3673346 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3673347 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3673348 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3673349 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3673350 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3673351 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3673352 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3673353 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3673354 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3673355 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3673356 who are open to doing something on the production side
3673357 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3673358 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3673359 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3673360 life is a b movie its stupid and its strange its a directionless story the dialogue is lame but in the he said she said sometimes theres some poetry if you turn your back long enough and let it happen naturally

3673403 most of them we wont discuss in here i just think its the right thing to do for this game
3673404 ricky has played a lot of rugby his legs were getting heavier and heavier and its the right time now to make a change
3673405 he is a great player real quality and the best half back in the world
3673406 he knows the job is more important than the milestone but this is as huge as madibas 90th only 10 more i have been coaching him since 1979 much laughter 1997 and the player he is plus the experience he brings to the side are what make him so extraordinary he is prepared to share all his knowledge to everyone in the side and even if he is not playing he is the same person the same character
3673407 i dont want to talk too much about it our focus must be on a big three weeks ahead of us i am pretty relaxed about it but its about what goals you want to set
3673408 this is more about south africa beating the all blacks than about all these guys getting these milestones

3673410 raising the bar and then trying to match it next time out is always something you are aware of
3673411 predominantly in the past we have had a good performance but then havent quite backed it up the following week
3673412 we have had some discussions about how we are going to go about that we have to try and emulate what we did in auckland as best we can and hopefully get the result we want but its not just a mental thing there is a little bit more to it than that obviously you have got to do all your homework and then you have got to be on edge and that is probably the hardest thing
3673413 it is easier if you have got your backs against the wall to get up that extra little bit of excitement comes from being backed into a corner you know you have to deliver
3673414 but now we have had a good performance how do you lift yourselves up to that same level as the last time we have got to try and figure that and do our best to follow it through
3673415 hes a very good player they must have some terrific talents if he cant get into the squad

3673454 tutti questi peccati nessuno escluso sono stati commessi nella storia del mondo ma non solo sono stati commessi anche nella storia della chiesa da laici ma anche da preti da suore da religiosi da cardinali da vescovi e anche da papi tutti

3673460 anche nella curia romana ciascuno vuole essere di pi ne viene una certa inconscia censura nelle parole certe cose non si dicono perch si sa che bloccano la carriera questo un male gravissimo della chiesa soprattutto in quella ordinata secondo gerarchie perch ci impedisce di dire la verit si cerca di dire ci che piace ai superiori si cerca di agire secondo quello che si immagina sia il loro desiderio facendo cos un grande disservizio al papa stesso

3673484 the report from the fire marshal has not been completed
3673485 my concern is that there is a problem with that fire department
3673486 i was first on the scene and able to watch if it had not been for the departments from pease portsmouth and greenland that entire complex would have gone up in flames newington sent people who did not know what to do
3673487 when they got there they never set up a command center and couldnt get the truck to run so instead of a 2 500 property damage claim the house burned down
3673488 everyone knows what happened of course but i want to push it far enough so it never happens again
3673489 people came with over 40 years of experience between them i dont want them to come to my house and if the chief is in charge of training i dont want him as the chief
3673490 every year they ask for more equipment more men and when they get to the first serious fire in 10 years they cant put it out
3673491 its a little party house down there and no one does anything about it what if that fire had happened four hours later and people were sleeping there would have been a fatality

3673500 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3673501 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3673502 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3673503 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3673514 we want to discourage consumers from purchasing coral scientist andrew baker says
3673515 its like ivory its a product of a living animal and the harvest of this item is unsustainable
3673516 there has been a huge trend toward coral in the past five or six years says artist michael aram who sculpts faux coral household items out of enamel painted metal

3673525 happily ive always loved his stuff just about everything he painted had a story to it
3673526 im hoping that the public has as much fun at it as weve had creating it

3673529 were getting the knack of building them it takes a lot less time not only to assemble the ships but to test them
3673530 the waterfront crew was able to fire 12 dummy torpedoes the same size shape and weight as the torpedoes that will be used
3673531 we fired 12 simulated torpedoes and we had 12 consecutive successful launches
3673532 this ship absolutely hit all the marks it was supposed to its the best one yet its firing on all cylinders
3673533 when you buy a new car you want to go on a test drive you want to make sure everything works from power steering to the engine to the radio you want to make sure all the knobs are where theyre supposed to be
3673534 the navy is taking the boat out with that same thought in mind

3673540 last week my uncle caught a butterfish weighing over 10 kg

3673542 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3673543 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3673544 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3673545 this is a great place to work compassionate effective management and family style teamwork
3673546 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3673547 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3673553 he was transported to portsmouth regional hospital for treatment and released on personal recognizance bail while there

3673560 her role is to educate the public about early maritime trade and one of the ways she does that is to sail to other ports and with our onboard rangers tell the story

3673562 they made many many journeys back and forth and that was how we got our goods that was the basis for international commerce we experience today
3673563 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3673564 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3673565 the art of nancy cooper funk nature pets scenes of the kennebunks
3673566 we expect to review them in september and have someone on board in october
3673567 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3673572 it is important for us that we get together as a community to discuss ideas on how to weather the energy crisis
3673573 with the rising cost of energy affecting all of us we all need this open forum to learn how to be as energy efficient as possible
3673574 high gas prices and heating oil costs have the people of maine very concerned
3673575 i want to make sure the best information is available to members of our community so people will stay warm and safe throughout the winter i hope that this forum will allow york county residents to see the options they have to get assistance if they need it as well as tips to improve home heating efficiency

3673581 a surf contest does not necessarily warrant an expanded area
3673582 it doesnt affect them because they send the competitors out in heats of about six people at a time

3673584 as we said the last time we presented to you this is a plan that weve met with the neighborhood group and took their input and comments
3673585 i believe that at this time we have the support of the neighbors
3673586 this is the design we chose this is the one we like very much this now has a turning lane from old post to ridge so that the people turning do not get into the other lane and that outcropping will prevent speeders from going up the hill

3673588 our mission is promoting science literacy from pre k to the elderly
3673589 they park wherever they want to they just park right in my driveway and dont think a thing of it

3673596 basically if you dont make 50 000 to 60 000 a year its going to be difficult for you to purchase a home under this ordinance
3673597 a teacher making 33 000 a year could start with a rental and then move into a townhouse and finally a home as her income increases

3673606 i thought it was something they could take care of
3673607 i do wish the housing authority were more attentive to the residents for which it is already responsible
3673608 we do an annual inspection we see every unit every spring
3673609 we inspect every year every year for the last several years it has been rated good
3673610 we pick random units and inspect for safety violations such as tripping hazards electrical outlets its a pretty comprehensive inspection
3673611 i called the maintenance man and he came to change the bulb he hands me a 100 watt bulb for a fixture rated for 60 watts
3673612 if i think there is something over there that needs attention well be all over it
3673613 we are very lucky to have this much senior housing in this size town

3673673 overly burdensome in an economic climate where food stores bodegas and supermarkets are going out of business it is not the time to add regulatory burdens that make it more difficult for these neighborhood stores to survive and service their community

3673691 in particular it puts an end to the irritation of waiting 5 or 10 minutes for everyone to call in there are also no missing overseas participants who cant figure out the right time zone in which to call phone calls become scheduled meetings its phenomenal when everyones phone rings at once
3673692 the idea behind pstn connect is to provide users with a flexibility they dont have today for example the viper universal secure phone will appeal to those whose installations currently use the pstn network but who plan to migrate to voice over ip users who currently have voice over ip networks and others who plan to stay with traditional pstn

3673723 ma ritengo di avere ormai dimostrato che il clima culturale del diciottesimo secolo era impregnato di esoterismo e che questa moda aveva fatto proseliti anche sulle rive del baltico eppure proprio l nel 1781 immanuel kant d alle stampe la critica della ragion pura sembrerebbe lapice il trionfo dellilluminismo vero e invece no niente affatto
3673724 largomentazione da cui la critica prende le mosse molto semplice sette pi cinque fa dodici e questo lo sappiamo tutti eppure dice kant potete analizzare in lungo e in largo la nozione di 7 la nozione di 5 e il concetto di somma non ci troverete mai la nozione di 12
3673725 noi che non ci occupiamo di filosofia ma di musica possiamo concederci un altro tipo di curiosit come mai kant scelse per il suo esempio proprio 7 5 12 i filosofi gli storici della filosofia non si sono mai posta questa domanda e forse non una malignit supporre che labbiano evitata perch non saprebbero dare una risposta ebbene io sono qui per sottoporvi unipotesi affascinante 7 5 12 potrebbe essere un messaggio cifrato
3673726 a chi si rivolgeva kant chi era il suo pubblico una ristretta cerchia di gentiluomini in gran parte massoni che coltivavano studi esoterici e intendevano la musica con spirito pitagorico signore e signori non voglio tenervi in sospeso la mia ipotesi che 7 5 12 alluda occultamente allunione delle sette note e dei cinque semitoni in una parola alla dodecafonia
3673727 scientismo e positivismo hanno fatto strame di una antica sapienza che nella k nigsberg del 1781 non era ancora scomparsa kant intu lirrompere di un secolo materialista e indic nella musica la catacomba in cui conservare le dottrine pi occulte forse un caso se nei primi anni del secolo successivo beethoven spezz le scale armoniche e apr la strada verso la dissoluzione della tonalit e non significativo che sch nberg lalfiere della dodecafonia dopo aver composto unopera dedicata a mos il pi grande dei maghi si sia immerso egli stesso negli studi sapienziali dopo kant un filone esoterico ha seguitato a scorrere nella musica come un fiume carsico dal flauto magico al parsifal e oltre
3673728 ma si dir che cosa ci autorizza ad acchiappare il nostro massimo filosofo per le falde della redingote e a tirarlo gi dalle vette della ragione fino alla palude delle scienze occulte lo scettico pu facilmente obiettare che congetture se ne possono fare a quintali non costano niente

3673758 when we launched envy post we wanted to start off on the right foot with an advanced booking and scheduling management system and my previous experience with scheduall led me to recommend it strongly over any other solution
3673759 schedualls ability to provide a high level view of all projects and their associated resources data and billing information has made the system a critical element in our success
3673760 scheduall makes our lives a lot easier by saving time helping our producers to be more productive and giving us the intelligence we need to make informed decisions for future resource allocations
3673761 this has been especially important as weve expanded to two locations with a third opening soon
3673762 scheduall was specifically designed to meet the needs of companies like envy post that are dealing with rapid growth and an explosion of information that needs to be accessed and managed efficiently throughout the lifecycle of a video project

3673807 lupus can be a debilitating disease that damages organs causes pain and loss of function and reduces the quality of life in patients suffering from the disease who are often young women
3673808 the phase 1 trials with this antibody have demonstrated that it can inhibit activity of interferon alpha in patients with lupus and that its safety profile supports further clinical development in lupus
3673809 i believe that the comments of the fda on our proposed design of a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial with atpace are constructive and will allow us to move expeditiously forward in the development of this proposed drug for the acute treatment of psvt
3673810 data from an earlier reported placebo controlled phase 1 study suggested therapeutic activity with single doses in patients with lupus and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile
3673811 we are very excited about the role of the interferon alpha inflammatory pathway and look forward to exploring its potential in treating patients with lupus and other autoimmune diseases
3673812 we are very pleased to have reached the enrollment criteria to conduct the planned interim analysis
3673813 our independent data safety monitoring board dsmb will meet to review the efficacy data on an unblinded basis for the first time in addition the dsmb will evaluate the safety of viprinex as theyve been doing since the start of the studies
3673814 we believe that data from 500 patients is sufficient for the dsmb to conduct a thorough assessment of futility and have accordingly moved up the interim analysis from earlier plans to conduct it at 650 patients
3673815 this is a significant milestone for the program and we are all looking forward to learning the outcome of this review

3673873 maar uiteindelijk wil je de long tail in simpelweg omdat het niet nu online 29 bezoekers aantal artikelen hittery is een zoekmachine die alleen 4 000 vooraf geselecteerde websites doorzoekt alle sites zijn beoordeeld op basis van originaliteit relevantie en waarde op die manier proberen we gebruikers alleen waardevolle zoekresultaten te bieden naast de hoofdzoekmachine hebben we 60 zoekmachines ontwikkeld rondom specifieke onderwerpen zoals gezondheid wijn en reizen ook voor die zoekmachines geldt dat ze alleen vooraf geselecteerde sites doorzoeken
3673874 aanleiding voor hittery is het toenemende probleem van zoekmachine vervuiling van bekende zoekmachines voor sommige trefwoorden moet je lang zoeken voordat je een waardevol zoekresultaat krijgt door alleen vooraf goedgekeurde sites te doorzoeken wordt dit probleem voorkomen
3673875 hittery is dinsdag 12 augustus 2008 live gegaan tot nu toe zijn de reacties overwegend positief wel zijn er vragen over het aantal sites dat doorzocht wordt mensen geven aan dat 4 000 sites misschien te weinig is om voldoende omvang te hebben voor ons extra reden om door te gaan met het rubriceren en toevoegen van websites

3673928 i had a message from him on monday and we are looking for him to come back and start some batting practice next week
3673929 i said at the time that there is still a lot of cricket left in michael he has to score a lot of runs for yorkshire and then who knows what will happen in the future for him there are four games left for him to score heavily in
3673930 i think it is premature to be talking about that
3673931 i have yet to sit down with him and discuss things but the main thing is that he concentrates on scoring runs
3673932 this high priest of ours understands our weaknesses for he faced all of the same temptations we do yet he did not sin so let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious god there we will receive his mercy and we will find grace to help us when we need it
3673933 my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death stay here and watch
3673934 while jesus was here on earth he offered prayers and pleadings with a loud cry and tears to the one who could deliver him out of death and god heard his prayers because of his reverence for god
3673935 lord i am submitting my will to yours not my will but yours be done
3673936 how about his plan for jesus that didnt seem very good
3673937 thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you a future and a hope
3673938 we are always trying to produce the best possible pitches and when you have put so much hard work in it hurts when people say things like that
3673939 sometimes ive had my wife up in the middle of the night helping me to drag extra covers on when rain has arrived which hasnt been forecast
3673940 we thought we had a dry pitch for that match but with the moisture around it seemed to sit in the grass sometimes in the same sort of weather it can be okay but there are still times when a pitch can surprise me
3673941 we start work at 7am or even earlier depending on the weather and i think we have improved the pitches immensely they have much more even bounce and good pace
3673942 moisture content is critical and over the years we have learnt to manage it if the river falls it draws moisture out and we have to water constantly in a wet spell we get a high water table and we cant do anything about that all we can do is keep the surface water off
3673943 the pitches were slow and after a game the grass was dead
3673944 we struggled with uneven grass cover but we seem to have sorted it out
3673945 we always had pacy pitches but in the early years we had a lot of trouble with uneven bounce no matter what we tried we couldnt sort that out
3673946 people know what diouf is all about and we will have to look after him and help him to try to make sure he does not get himself into trouble because referees will be after him they target certain players
3673947 its part of my job and other players to make sure he doesnt react in a bad way you do get different reactions from certain players
3673948 diouf is a character every player brings different challenges and i will get on with my job as normal he is bubbly everyone knows what he is about sometimes he gets himself into trouble or others create it for him but im sure he will be fine
3673949 when you watch a game you are talking about a referee and it would be interesting if they came out and explained the situation cleared it up for everyone concerned
3673950 every referee is different referees have a tough job but if we can help it clean up its image then thats great
3673951 i am happy at sunderland i dont know if other clubs have made enquiries but like i said i am happy here
3673952 pet behaviour studies changed my life i never saw animals the same way again
3673953 there are so many things in this world that distract them children grow up to be people who have no depth and are later susceptible to stress and mental illness
3673954 animals can teach us how to de stress if we know how to cohabit with them properly pet behaviour studies cultivates a students sense of observation as we understand animals we also begin to understand ourselves
3673955 our experiments are like games which both the students and animals enjoy it stimulates the mind and at the same time teaches young people that animals are intelligent creatures students then learn to be sensitive to other human beings especially those who are not like them
3673956 being sensitive is a key factor in the making of a great psychologist
3673957 i carried out a project that investigated whether hamsters are able to distinguish more than one object through it i learnt how to train and understand my own pets
3673958 i spend long hours observing studying and interacting with animals in the wild when i learnt that drs teoh and cheong shared my love of animals we decided to pool our resources to work together for the benefit of the students says dr sagathevan
3673959 many commercial zoos dont bother about this and cause the animals great stress by allowing people to disturb them all day long these zoos also do not teach the public the proper way to hold animals indirectly they are sending a message that it is all right to manhandle them
3673960 i was quite shocked when i saw painted chicks being sold at a pasar malam ive seen shops selling fish injected with dye to make them luminous all these are done by ignorant people
3673961 we chose to champion the cause of tarantulas because they are seriously misunderstood by society
3673962 in a way we are speaking out against societys ignorance
3673963 in the past trees were just part of the landscape but now we see them as a vital part of the eco system for the survival of all forms of life including mankind
3673964 we want to create a stimulating environment for our students to open up a whole world of possibilities so that they will learn to face every challenge in life with ethics and a positive regard for others

3673976 museum mission to house all the surviving antiquities from the acropolis within a single museum of international stature
3673977 offers me the means of placing in a useful distinguished and agreeable way the various things that you may perhaps be able to procure for me
3673978 it tells the story of the presentation of the most important athenian feast to honour the goddess of the city athena for the first time all the groups of athenian society the common people and officials are presented in a democratic way on a similar level as the gods
3673979 i dont believe there is any real controversy at the heart of this project
3673980 true it raised many kinds of questions is it the right place in which to build for example but why should it be negative if it had been a private project a hotel a block of flats it would have been ok so why not a museum
3673981 how to make an architectural statement at the foot of one of the most influential buildings of all time how to design a building on a site already occupied by extensive archaeological excavations and in an earthquake prone region and how to design a museum to contain an important collection of classical greek sculptures and a singular masterpiece the parthenon frieze currently still housed in the british museum
3673982 the lower floor fits to the site and the upper floor fits to the broader environment
3673983 a visual dialogue a cultural platform to the parthenon and the acropolis
3673984 the openings you see now represent sculptures held in athens
3673985 while the door cavities represent the destruction by the venetian mercenary army under general morosini in 1687 the vacant walls represent objects in london
3673986 the parthenon hall makes clear the continuity between the various components the pieces we have of the frieze are of very high quality so you can clearly imagine how they would have been on the original building in a second we can tell the story of the parthenon marbles as it has never been told before i dont know of another museum in the world where you can get all the time the feeling of the original unit of an ancient artistic complex the opposite of the idea of a fragmentary culture
3673987 he will be more articulate because he will be shown in context with other athletic figures such as bronzes found on the acropolis now in the national museum
3673988 you will also be able to see the back of a kore so we will have opportunities to do things weve not been able to do before
3673989 it is a museum of an archaeological site the museum is about connecting pieces and it is interesting to show people the process by which we put things together it will be a museum in action
3673990 as a scholar and a member of the archaeological service it is a dream come true
3673991 i think its a universal museum in its own way you dont need to have the old type of universal museum to have a universal museum its the message that comes out of the museum that counts and if we follow what the british museum has been talking about recently in terms of a new enlightenment well enlightenment keeps on coming from the acropolis from the parthenon its a never ending procedure its the way each society of every century grasps the message uses it for the needs of its time the needs of each society so its a universal contribution
3673992 in just five years fashion rocks has become one of the most exciting multi media events of the year

3674097 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3674098 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3674099 it says yes our farmers can produce the second largest corn crop in history despite all the adverse weather thrown at them
3674100 an early frost is a concern and if that looks like it could happen then the markets might truck back up
3674101 you have to give the usda some margin for error because this is an august 1 estimate
3674102 the yield estimates were very large for a year when everyone thought the crop was stressed
3674103 to reach those estimated yield numbers we will need to continue to have good weather and probably a later than normal frost
3674104 although this is very good news for end users across the globe lets not forget about farmers in the midwest who are still recovering from the worst flooding in 15 years
3674105 despite the devastation they endured they rose to the task of generating a reliable supply of grains
3674106 clearly the ethanol industry is more satisfied that the supply of corn this year will be adequate
3674107 our crops are looking better than they did earlier in the year our corn has tasseled about two weeks behind normal so its a little bit early to be out in the fields doing some kernel counts to estimate yields our soybeans are coming on but theyre just starting to set pods august is the critical month for soybeans so we wont know about yields until later there is a lot of spraying going on for aphids yields it all depends on when the freeze comes there are still a lot of questions about this crop i drove through northwest iowa last week and it looks really good up there its hard not to be envious
3674108 our corn wont average 150 bushels an acre this year its three weeks to a month behind normal maturity in the past several years weve had some tremendous crops we had 185 to 215 bushel an acre corn last year this spring we had 20 inches of rain in three weeks and it drowned the crops out after i had them planted i got potholes i never got planted and i planted from april 20 to june 28 i kept having to replant i replanted 85 acres of beans and 13 acres of corn
3674109 july was a fantastic month for us we didnt have any extreme heat or moisture it brought the crops back from all the rain we had in may and june so its going to be a decent crop but i dont think it will be as good as last year when the countys corn averaged 185 bushels an acre
3674110 the soybeans are about half as tall as they should be and are still blooming but they havent set any pods yet ive had to spray for aphids too what should you pay for in home child care talk about it at dmmoms com place an ad
3674111 we have gas in the garage daddy ill go get it

3674126 we are here today to share our views on one of the critical success factors in the actualisation of my governments vision of a greater akwa ibom one of these happens to be the thrust of this public lecture the issue of unity
3674127 the second impetus to our resolve to pursue akwa ibom unity project is the noble history behind the creation of the state which we now commemorate
3674128 akup is beyond mere advocacy it is all about complete unity embedded further in the principle of equality of akwa ibom people
3674129 akwa ibom unity project is a philosophical issue of the current administration whereby every akwa ibom person irrespective of tribe age and sex will be evolved in the enterprise of akwa ibom
3674130 i almost fought with an ibibio man when he mimicked my dialect and later treated me disdainfully
3674131 during the last electioneering period i voted for an ibibio man for marriage i want to marry an ibibio man not annang or oron person
3674132 the principle of equality of akwa ibom person will bring about total unity where every akwa ibom man has access to the blessing and placement of akwa ibom interest
3674133 economic unity was not comprehended in the past and that is why governor akpabio is doing now by ensuring economic unity in order to sustain political unity
3674134 i therefore implore every akwa ibom man woman and child to take the unity issue seriously and be ready to shirk past orientation and uphold the new in which we must all see ourselves as akwa ibom people and not as ibibio annang and oron in all our dealings with one another

3674171 strong underwriting standards and the focused and specialist nature of our business model
3674172 we are confident our strong underwriting standards centralised structure and ownership culture will serve the bank well during this down cycle as virtually all lending is secured by tangible collateral our total provisions comfortably exceed our net exposure to impaired loans furthermore even allowing for a lending impairment charge in line with the 2009 market consensus of 0 7 some four to five times the anticipated current year level and above management expectations the bank would remain highly profitable and capital accretive in 2009 our assessment is that the market environment will remain significantly challenged accordingly we will restrict new lending activity our primary focus being the management of asset quality and organically building our capital base in addition we will invest further in our funding franchises these actions will serve to protect and enhance the banks strong balance sheet and position us well for when markets begin to recover notwithstanding the current market dislocation our performance in 2008 underscores the resilience and value of the business model we are confident that the bank will continue to demonstrate strong returns in 2009 and over the longer term
3674173 against the backdrop of difficult market conditions anglo irish bank will report another very good performance in 2008 we remain focused on carefully managing the banks balance sheet and continuing to generate recurring and sustainable profits we believe that this consistent and disciplined approach to business will continue to deliver for shareholders

3674207 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3674208 second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3674209 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers

3674256 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
3674257 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
3674258 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
3674259 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one

3674261 ive been very happy with the service google provide so i will be sticking with them

3674276 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3674277 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3674278 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3674279 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3674280 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3674281 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3674282 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3674286 oh yes on india independence day everyone flies kites from the rooftops
3674287 how are you going to fit them in your pack
3674288 not for me i want to buy some for the singing street boys
3674289 the book aka lonely planet says you are not supposed to give the street urchins anything or they will never leave you alone
3674290 these boys very dangerous they will try to trick you and take your money
3674291 well that is true of pretty much everyone in delhi
3674292 i just think they would like some kites they cost less then 5 cents
3674293 the boys want to know what they are supposed to do with your gifts
3674294 what do you mean they dont know how to fly kites
3674295 they do but you didnt get any string say the guide
3674296 oh well they are creative boys i guess they will figure something out
3674297 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
3674298 university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
3674299 the spelling of the word judgement for example is now widely accepted as a variant of judgment so why cant truely be accepted as a variant spelling of truly
3674300 all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
3674301 em vez de nos queixarmos do sistema de ensino como estamos ano ap s ano a corrigir os mesmos erros eu tenho uma ideia melhor

3674347 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing

3674358 unofficially we have heard of them but they are not in our accounting system we have given the entire case over to the police

3674388 it is interesting to see what business leaders focus on when recession is looming their workforce and diversification it is obvious that at times of economic slowdown getting organizational buy in as a whole is vital which is why taking a strong leadership approach is such a key part of thriving during these times leaders need to instill the ability to re energize re think and re focus the business using realistic targets a companys workforce is an essential tool in the business armory when the going gets tough making productivity a focal point and rewarding those who rise to the top accordingly will help reduce an organizations exposure to the risk of recession
3674389 these results clearly highlight a real understanding across the north american business community of the value of forward planning in limiting the damage of a potential recession as well as the tactical actions that need to be taken to achieve this however it is worrying that such a low number of business leaders and organizations have these advanced plans in place
3674390 any time whether a recession is imminent or not it is vital that businesses have their house in order by having a clear focus and strategy in place as well as ensuring resources are suitably allocated to provide the best return on investment that way when a recession does strike they will be able to stay lean and emerge stronger
3674391 the next generation network which will make extensive use of ip and web services is still years away from generating serious revenue and in the meantime carriers are not about to fork lift out the infrastructure that makes them money today
3674392 gateways form the link between todays revenue generating services and what the carriers will be building to generate their future revenue streams so we expect the telecommunications gateway market to continue growing for at least the next five years
3674393 free for people to do a short sale and in most instances it doesnt impact your credit
3674394 almost all other companies who offer the same service have a system where people have to click through several pages to complete the various online registrations

3674396 the eply tool made dealing with conference registration refunds and reporting a breeze
3674397 it was a great solution for the joys of event planning
3674398 we can virtually meet any requirements that special event and conference coordinators may have
3674399 corporate event planners and other decision makers who spend millions annually on corporate events meetings and business luncheons in the new york metro area have increasingly requested hotels for their events and meetings

3674411 i dont have much choice its a young one or a younger one it is always a bit tricky when you have players come back for pre season so late
3674412 you try to rush the fitness when you have champions league qualifiers and some of them get injuries thats what has happened with cesc who only returned on july 29 from the european championship its the most problematic start to a season numbers wise we are short of one player and i hope to do something this week or before the transfer deadline
3674413 the darjeeling hills will close for an indefinite period from tomorrow we will not heed to any authority nor wait for any permission from the state government we have made enough compromises and from now on all our efforts will be directed towards attaining gorkhaland
3674414 there will be a total closure of educational institutions offices shops transportation and tea plantations we all have to make this sacrifice for gorkhaland
3674415 it is sad that we have to leave so early it is better to leave than remain stranded here for an indefinite period

3674417 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3674418 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3674419 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3674420 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3674421 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3674422 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3674423 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3674424 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3674425 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3674426 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3674427 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3674428 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3674429 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3674430 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3674431 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3674432 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3674433 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3674434 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3674435 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3674436 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3674437 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3674438 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3674439 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3674440 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3674441 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3674442 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3674443 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3674444 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3674445 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3674446 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3674447 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3674448 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3674449 he who is not contented with what he has would not be contented with what he would like to have
3674450 arroyo is insincere in her proposals for a surgical amendment of the constitution to supposedly incorporate federalism and achieve peace in mindanao there is no precise surgical amendment in her proposed constituent assembly because once constituted this constituent assembly can overhaul the entire constitution at its discretion
3674451 once congress is convened as a constituent assembly there is no constitutional restriction for the constituent assembly to revise not merely amend one or two provisions in the constitution
3674452 while amendment pertains to changes of one or two provisions revision means the power to change many provisions and even overhaul the entire constitution
3674453 it is therefore clear that arroyo is merely riding on the issues of federalism and peace in mindanao to push for charter change which is ultimately aimed at prolonging her stay in power and eliminating the protectionist economic provisions in the constitution
3674454 a document as important as the moa ad memorandum of agreement ancestral domain that would define the process of achieving lasting peace in the affected areas of mindanao could only be drafted and agreed if the terms of the same are negotiated under the democratic requirements of absolute transparency and full consultation involving all key stakeholders
3674455 therefore be it resolved as it is hereby resolved that this house of representatives shall call for the evaluation review and revision of the memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain aspect of the grp milf tripoli agreement on peace of 2001
3674456 under absolute transparency to forge a better agreement for implementation to achieve lasting peace and development
3674457 this resolution is simply to impress the sentiments of the members of congress
3674458 siguro this is also to add pressure to the supreme court that theres a pending motion there questioning the constitutionality and on the grounds we have this resolution questioning the moa
3674459 this is an avenue we need to further the peace negotiations but we need to do it right with all transparency and with the inclusion of all stakeholders yun yung hinihingi naming
3674460 if indeed the sc declares the moa as unconstitutional we will still again persist in trying to find another agreement to forge another agreement that will hopefully encompass everyones sentiments

3674464 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
3674465 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
3674466 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
3674467 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3674468 is obama touched or tainted by this in any stretch of the imagination
3674469 i dont think he is at all lester you know if anything sure that they lose a good surrogate this was a guy who was very good on the stump
3674470 is there any stomach for john mccain perhaps using taking some political advantage of this or will he simply leave this alone as a third rail
3674471 not at all theyre probably going to leave this alone john mccain had to deal with a story that their campaign was very upset about that did theyre not going to touch this you know stuff like this usually ends up getting swept under the rug pretty quickly
3674472 can the right wing withstand yet another scandal involving one of its own

3674474 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3674475 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3674476 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3674477 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3674478 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3674479 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3674480 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3674503 leading indicators for an above normal season during 2008 include the continuing multi decadal signal atmospheric and oceanic conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 and the lingering effects of la ni a
3674504 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
3674505 it is critical that everyone know the risk for your area and have a plan to protect yourself your family and your property or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season
3674506 even people who live inland should be prepared for severe weather and flooding from a tropical storm or a hurricane
3674507 the failure of the plutonium fuel experiment is another major setback for the mox program and will further increase the already considerable cost overruns delays and risks

3674509 to go forward with mox now areva would have to redesign the mox fuel and duke would have to repeat the entire experiment delaying the testing program by at least eight years doe should instead dispose of the plutonium directly by mixing it with radioactive waste and encasing it in glass which would be safer and cheaper than continuing the mox program
3674510 a re design of the catawba unit 1 cycle 18 core design was required to remove mox fuel assemblies from the core due to excessive assembly growth

3674513 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3674514 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3674515 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3674516 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3674517 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3674518 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3674519 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3674520 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3674521 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3674522 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss

3674525 every time i look at phoebe i know i made the right decision i never wanted to end my babys life just because of how she came to be
3674526 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
3674527 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly
3674528 anyone my age would want to have a baby rather than an abortion
3674529 i did and i dont regret it for a moment
3674530 having her in my life is such a joy from the first time i held her in my arms i have had this fierce bond with her a connection which started even before she was born she looks like me when i was her age and i feel strongly that she was meant to be a part of our family
3674531 while it was terrifying knowing that i was going to be a mum made me look forward and focus on something else i suppose i have tried to look beyond what happened to the life that was created
3674532 pro life 101 a step by step guide to making your case persuasively
3674533 how should a civil society treat innocent human beings that remind us of a painful event may we kill them so that we can feel better put differently can you think of any other case where having been victimized yourself you can justly turn around and victimize another completely innocent person
3674534 if the unborn is a human being she should not be killed to benefit her mother hardship does not justify homicide hence we are back to the one question that trumps all others in the abortion debate what is the unborn
3674535 it was as if i could hear the echoes of all those people who with the most sympathetic of tones would say well except in cases of rape or who would rather fervently exclaim in disgust especially is cases of rape all these people are out there who dont even know me but are standing in judgment of my life so quick to dismiss it just because of how i was conceived i felt like i was now going to have to justify my own existence

3674547 the break in the first season really allowed me to get out of the weeds of the show and look at where we were going with the stories we were just going to continue telling a lot of these episodic tales and we werent able to weave in as much of the serialized storyline as i wanted to in the first season

3674582 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3674583 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3674584 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3674585 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski

3674598 where is your most frequent and least controllable market contact
3674599 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3674600 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3674601 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3674602 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3674603 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3674604 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3674605 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3674606 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3674607 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3674608 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3674609 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3674610 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3674611 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3674612 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3674613 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3674614 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3674615 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3674616 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3674617 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3674618 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3674619 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3674620 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3674621 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3674622 well be back in two years with a longer one
3674623 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3674624 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3674625 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3674626 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3674627 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3674628 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3674629 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3674630 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3674631 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3674632 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3674633 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3674634 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3674635 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3674636 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3674637 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3674638 the only rapper that could still get money in the drought
3674639 and i chill with the thugs and the gangsters too i aint a blood but im warring with the boys in blue crooked officer crooked officer why you wanna see me in a coffin sir
3674640 seen you jockin j c cause he got a mercedes and you know about his ladies
3674641 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3674642 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3674643 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3674644 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3674645 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3674646 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3674647 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3674648 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3674649 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3674650 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3674651 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3674652 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3674653 for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3674654 im ok with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3674655 it adds yet another depressing layer to the pathetic existence that is jon
3674656 mere abstention from food has no effect on the spirit
3674657 great ill just stop eating sit back and let the spiritual bounties come over me
3674658 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3674659 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3674660 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3674661 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3674662 reflect gloomily on the present state of the language make dire prophecies about its future and wish things were like the earlier golden age they remember so well
3674663 they said they had to shut down the program because of no interpreter but we think its a lie and its about money
3674664 i dont want to go to rochester because ive been through it all in the system and its not good this is my sixth school i want to stay here until i graduate
3674665 i grew up here and i know a lot of people they are my classmates and i want to graduate with them
3674666 im really upset we dont have a lot of choices its really messed up
3674667 its not personal at all we adored the kids we felt very bad about it but theres not much we can do
3674668 we did an exhaustive search for interpreters and i feel very confident we did all we can do
3674669 nothing bad happened we certainly wouldve taken them right to the end theyre lovely kids popular and good students
3674670 weve tried everything shes written the governor commissioners the legislature and they all say theres nothing that can be done
3674671 err sorry to interrupt but id like to buy an 80gb silver ipod classic please
3674672 but can you tell me where i can find one please
3674673 hi there id like to buy an 80gb silver ipod classic please
3674674 im on my way to lunch that guy over there can help you out
3674675 i want an 80gb silver ipod classic im in a hurry
3674676 i need the laptop back as soon as possible not only was there a copy of my doctoral thesis on it but there was also more recent research work and book proposal documents
3674677 i need that laptop back im having problems functioning professionally without it and people should note that it does look distinctive as theres not many of them around
3674678 we are extremely proud of ryan because he wanted so much to raise money for the charity that had supported him since the age of four when he was diagnosed as deaf
3674679 he is very conscious that he is not the only person who is deaf and that with more funding deafconnect can go on to help more deaf children
3674680 deafconnect suppported me when ryan was young and helped me to learn sign language so it is nice to be able to give something back
3674681 i thought it would be a good idea to pay deafconnect back and to say thank you
3674682 i was shocked by how much we raised it was fantastic
3674683 we are very proud to have such active members of our community what ryan did for us was very special
3674684 he involved his whole community in the sale and did a great job
3674685 deafconnect runs summer trips to places such as wicksteed park and hamerton zoo which gives children who are being educated in mainstream schools the chance to be with other deaf children for the day
3674686 this is the sort of thing we might spend the money on but we want to make sure ryan is involved in the decision
3674687 the only person the medical team could find who knew sign language was my brother
3674688 i didnt want him to know i really didnt want anyone in my family to know i was physically hurt ashamed and embarrassed
3674689 its important that all people who are abused have someone to talk to someone impartial and knowledgeable who can offer advice without judgment
3674690 i would say that it is even more important for victims who have a disability to have that
3674691 i honestly didnt expect to see such a thing in my lifetime
3674692 one of the goals of the project will be to establish a national data collection process so we can get solid numbers to back up the need we know is there
3674693 what i can tell you is that statistically persons with disabilities are at least twice as likely to be victims of domestic or sexual assault when you consider that the statistics for the general population are already incredibly high one in three women is the accepted statistic although it varies this is a mind boggling problem
3674694 victim advocacy programs are not equipped to provide culturally appropriate and linguistically accessible services to deaf survivors
3674695 at best most programs will make a half hearted effort to find an interpreter for support groups or make sure their shelters are physically accessible this is not enough thus deaf victims and survivors rarely get the services they need to help them heal and move on with their lives
3674696 because my abuse was at the hands of a family member that had nearly constant access to me i moved into a facility for battered and abused women
3674697 it was nice enough rather like living in a dormitory but no one there spoke my language and i had a very limited ability at that time to read lips it was isolating although i logically understood that i was there to be helped and out of concern for my safety the day to day reality is that i felt as if i was being punished for what happened
3674698 the broad focus of this three year process will be building a strong foundation for jdvnc at the federal level focusing on sustainability
3674699 all of us involved in the project have a goal of making sure this organization is around for the long haul we have a lot of dreams to accomplish
3674700 the grant is for a continuation of the program that the iowa coalition has been doing since 2003
3674701 its a national technical assistance project that provides training support on site visits skill building conference calls and many other resources to the staff at all 54 state and territorial sexual assault coalitions which in turn hopefully means that there is a trickle down affect to the 1 350 rape crisis centers that are across the nation and serve all victims of sexual violence its a way for us to provide up to date information resource sharing and training to those coalition staff who then go back and share that information and those resources
3674702 there has been an understanding and a shift in the last few years that services from within culturally and linguistically specific communities are more effective than an outreach model of a mainstream rape crisis center providing services as an outreach effort to that community
3674703 services developed within that community are more apt to better meet the needs of survivors
3674704 i was thinking i had made a mistake coming here
3674705 we tried most of the schools in hamilton and leniker was just stuck at home all day
3674706 someone at the pathways course who had a compassionate ear met with us and accepted leniker to study there
3674707 warnings could be delivered to tty of disasters such as hazardous accidents or spills weather related events hostage situations fires and other public safety threats such messages would help save the lives of people who are deaf deaf blind hard of hearing or have a speech disability in addition these individuals could help and save other people who may not have a disability if they are aware of the disasters time delay in receiving messages increases stress and problems with evacuation and or threatens their well being each second counts
3674708 it reduces liability risk for non compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 stating that state county and city must assure that their programs and services are accessible to individuals with disabilities once again it would reduce injuries and deaths as well as danger in evacuation if notified ahead of time
3674709 these monsters had started to eat me up on the inside
3674710 ill never let them ill never let them ill never let them hurt you not tonight ill never let them i cant forget them ill never let them hurt you i promise struck down before our prime before you got off the floor can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
3674711 in washington d c all calls were dropped after a second or two

3674715 they can come in here and do the job search on their own
3674716 the richland county commissioners our director sharlene neumann and the local area 10 workforce investment board wib are extremely supportive of the onestops efforts to make services accessible to all residents of richland county
3674717 they just need high speed internet for the videophone to work

3674719 the hospital should provide patients with details of community organisations that provide
3674720 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3674721 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3674722 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3674723 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex
3674724 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3674725 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3674726 the key to moving beyond theory to success and survival in real patients has been finding the right medicine to combine with lovastatin when we have administered a precisely timed regimen of low dose interferon with lovastatin tumors have begun regressing sometimes within just a few weeks
3674727 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
3674728 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
3674729 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
3674730 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning
3674731 when a cell settles on a piece of bare thin glass
3674732 the membrane of the cell by definition is snuggled up against the glass and available to the radiation field
3674733 it was like using cameras to watch individual bank robbers move around as a holdup progressed
3674734 delaying medical treatment and regular physicals puts consumers at risk for potential health issues and increases overall health insurance costs
3674735 its critical that consumers continue to take responsibility for their health so that we can all benefit from healthier lives and more affordable healthcare
3674736 insurance is an important and oftentimes mandated purchase for most americans
3674737 that is why the naic and state insurance regulators are committed to helping every american be a smarter insurance consumer
3674738 insurance is one of the easiest ways that consumers can protect themselves against significant financial loss especially during difficult economic times
3674739 its also important that consumers understand their insurance needs and options we urge them to visit insure u to learn more

3674745 programs such as the go red for women founded by the american heart association aha have made great strides in raising awareness of heart diseases impact on women but the message apparently has not made its way into hispanic communities
3674746 our research suggests that there is a real opportunity to target this key ethnic group with educational efforts that raise awareness and promote prevention strategies
3674747 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3674748 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3674749 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
3674750 research in recent years has demonstrated that even very little babies know a lot about the outside world this has led many to suggest that we are born with a great deal of the knowledge we need but these new findings urge us to think differently about early development despite having a good grasp of what goes on in the outside world young babies may have more difficulties in understanding how they themselves and their bodies fit into that world
3674751 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3674752 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3674753 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3674754 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3674755 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3674756 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3674757 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3674758 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3674759 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3674760 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3674761 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3674762 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3674763 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population
3674764 only by understanding how this devastating disease develops will be able to begin taking steps to prevent it
3674765 persistence of pre diabetes in overweight and obese hispanic children association with progressive insulin resistance poor beta cell function and increasing visceral fat
3674766 i think that these sorts of discussions which bring together philosophers neuroscientists biologists and ecologists that try to analyse the fundamental issues in these areas using philosophical tools are very important if we are going to understand what the science is telling us
3674767 i think the conclusions of the papers that have been presented here are much more nuanced than just the broad claim that conscious will is an illusion some of the papers were trying to make room for a concept of free will that is larger than something measured in milliseconds even if it is just a sense that we have some control over the way we are doing something or acting
3674768 despite certain interpretations of the neuroscience this is something at a very pragmatic and personal level which we need to think about and for which we need to find some kind of explanation
3674769 i think one of the overarching things going on here is we are trying to work out what it is we should be talking about when we try to talk about conscious experience
3674770 the kinds of conversations we have had here have been very unusual because people from very different disciplines kind of felt that they understood what the others cared about and if we can get that it might not be a common territory but it is a pretty big condition for it
3674771 you should always try to camp with at least one partner so if someone gets hurt the other person can help
3674772 also before you leave for the camping trip be sure to notify someone at home where you are going and when you expect to return
3674773 in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities

3674832 hes taken the decision to move on because of family reasons and everyone knows family always comes first so good luck to him
3674833 believe it or not it was actually better toward the end
3674834 initially he was a little hard on me i was always fine with that as long as it was respectful
3674835 at times it was a little disrespectful and that bothered me but i think he figured out that as long as he treated me respectfully he could say things to me and i would get on with it so i would characterise it as good at the end
3674836 from ruuds standpoint i think its been difficult for him

3674883 this will be the first national medical cannabis protest since patients and activists gathered in washington dc in april 2000
3674884 patients are angry that the federal government continues to harass and prosecute medical cannabis patients and providers while blocking research into the drugs medicinal benefits we are tired of seeing friends arrested and harassed for using the medicine that helps hundreds of thousands of patients stay alive
3674885 it is time for the federal government to change its policy and the new president needs to recognize how important this issue is
3674886 inflation is likely to rise further this year and to peak at around 5 per cent in the coming months
3674887 it points to only limited scope for rate cuts nonetheless the tone is clearly dovish
3674888 i think with broadly flat output its bound to be the case that there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3674889 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
3674890 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3674891 i expect consumers to demand lower payments or even ask for a refund in the same way as bank charge customers
3674892 the big six are on average overcharging pre payment customers by 59 a year and those on standard credit by 69

3674903 i think the never events are a wake up call to everyone about the safety of california hospitals
3674904 we dont want people to be afraid when they come into hospitals because they are becoming safer and safer all the time
3674905 we would like to think we can prevent all of them but we cant
3674906 it will always be true that the vast majority of incidents are never reported
3674907 were still the only country required to remove our shoes to get through security
3674908 quivers down my kneebone i got the shakes in my thighbone

3674910 its not that im all that great of a guitar player you know
3674911 life rocks when you re cut the jigsaw of your personality
3674912 it was pretty shocking to us we didnt know what to do or say we called my mom saying they are taking our baby away
3674913 we started calling friends but no one we know has gone through something like this we were crying we thought oh my god they took our baby
3674914 the system sounds problematic because they are doing urine only screens and if they are not doing confirmation tests they are going to have a lot of false positives
3674915 so we have been asking the department of children and family services a lot more questions about substance abuse issues
3674916 how do they test are they randomly testing what kind of tests are they doing we certainly would support whenever possible to do confirmatory tests
3674917 nobody is following the law the judges seem to be handling these positive toxicology screens like a drug war on women
3674918 they are telling moms you tested positive for drugs you are a bad mom and we are going to take your kids away but under the law the mom has to be abusive or negligent in the care of the baby
3674919 some hospitals are not submitting these protocol forms at all
3674920 hospitals dont like being put in this position and so many hospitals will consider the positive toxicology test all the screening they have to do
3674921 and that will be can be and often is the sole determinant in regard to referrals to dcfs and then they let the child welfare investigators sort the rest of it out
3674922 the hospitals are erring on the side of safety for the child and they could be faulted for the screening process the only objective fact based criteria the hospital has is the toxicology test screening can be determined to be subjective
3674923 the law does not say you cannot make a referral without having done the screening
3674924 it says you should do the screening if you are going to make a referral
3674925 i know that sounds twisted but anyone can make a referral without a screening and its up to the investigators to decide whether to detain the baby
3674926 i think oftentimes hospitals want to err on the side of caution and as mandated reporters they call us immediately
3674927 and somewhere in the process either the confirmation doesnt get done or they never get to the next step of assessing the risk of child mistreatment
3674928 but the more awareness we can raise the better off we are in terms of keeping families together
3674929 we can suggest they do a confirmatory test but they dont always do it
3674930 we dont want to inappropriately take children from their families the disruption is not worth it so we try to confirm as much as we can
3674931 im concerned there are false positives sometimes but usually there are more false negatives because of the games people play
3674932 unless the test is actually witnessed at the hospital certain games can be played to alter the tests there are all kinds of ways people can change the results
3674933 thousands if not hundreds of thousands of families have been undermined by unnecessary child welfare investigations based on nothing more than a single unconfirmed drug test
3674934 while it may be harmful for a pregnant mother to use marijuana or other drugs it is far more harmful to that child to have to endure the trauma of foster care
3674935 this doesnt mean you simply leave a baby with an addict but it does mean that drug treatment for the mother should be the first choice instead of foster care for the child and those are cases where there really is a problem
3674936 about 40 to 60 percent of them end up back as intact families
3674937 we work really hard to get these parents connected to services because we want to reunify them
3674938 it can have an influence on fetal growth birth weight and neurological function
3674939 but we are saying there are other influences on fetal growth that may be more costly in terms of their damaging effects than drug use
3674940 i think a lot of people would agree with lester
3674941 is she thinking of when she was in the dcfs car and the door closed and she was driven away from us to be placed in a home with a whole bunch of strangers

3674964 there was a lot of humidity in the airport area the plane circled twice over the landing zone eventually hit a telephone line two kilometres away and crashed
3674965 we rushed to the scene but unfortunately we couldnt find anybody alive we collected the burnt remains of three people
3674966 we discovered the bodies of three men and they seem to be the crew of the plane
3674967 this is the first time a study has compared the real cardiovascular effects of exercise intensity in individuals with metabolic syndrome
3674968 individuals who took part in the study exercised with different intensities but used the same amount of energy in each training session
3674969 prescription of exercise training physical activity should be different for individuals with metabolic syndrome and in inactive individuals
3674970 look at the effects of todays recommendations they do not work or we do not get people to exercise as much as recommended instead more and more people get fat and get metabolic syndrome
3674971 a lot of people find it hard to train most days of the week and todays recommendations may therefore be a hindrance instead of a motivator for these persons
3674972 our take home message is that these people should try to perform the interval regimen described in the paper two times per week over 10 to 14 weeks we normally see that these people get fit fast and the only side effects of this medicine observed so far is that they start to be more physically active on the other days of the week we have clearly demonstrated that it is not possible to substitute exercise intensity with exercise duration shorter and harder training sessions may be good medicine for improved fitness and reversal and prevention of established cardiovascular risk factors
3674973 however these added benefits must be weighed against the potential for increased musculoskeletal and cardiovascular complications as well as reduced compliance
3674974 accordingly when previously sedentary individuals can comfortably exercise at a moderate intensity they should consider the goal of more vigorous exercise provided that it is sustainable and can be achieved without adverse signs or symptoms
3674975 combined with the present study in individuals with metabolic syndrome where the majority will certainly get cardiovascular disease and die prematurely from cardiovascular causes we are quite confident that this is an effective treatment strategy that now needs to be taken seriously by medical doctors
3674976 hopefully this will give us valuable information two to four years from now
3674977 goes back to the 1990s when the senate of berlin in an administrative reform combined the two neighborhoods into one township voting district most likely to block the left wing pds party from getting a broader representation in government
3674978 the agreement gives ener1 sole ownership of crucial assets at an important time in this rapidly growing industry
3674979 it gives us more freedom and greater opportunity to bring innovations to market faster and at lower cost the transition also paves the way for new strategic partnerships something we have long said is a key competitive objective
3674980 the market demands new technology from suppliers particularly now when the need to transition away from fossil fuels is great this is an opportunity for us to unlock important resources and bring them into play quickly and competitively
3674981 help government and company decision makers ensure climate change vulnerability is included in planning and strategy as well as to assist in mitigating the impacts of climate change
3674982 it was setup to examine legal and legislative responses to allegations of misconduct and expansions of executive powers by the bush administration
3674983 and all those who have lost their homes lifes work pensions or possibility to get looked after when their ill unfortunately history is telling us a rather crude and sad reality
3674984 but we say at least some of those who should say something about it did at least speak up for some hours
3674985 for these disastrous ways of handling of even the basic situations happening throughout that administration
3674986 at times the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal well meaning but without understanding
3674987 and his initial purchase of about 670 mw wind turbines from ge earlier this year regulators have now preliminary approved a plan to invest about usd 5 billion into the electrical grid infrastructure connecting new alternative wind energy projects in the wind rich west and the panhandle to the urban areas of texas
3674988 will allow the transmission of up to 18 500 mw of power from the sparsely populated areas where wind power plants are already being build to the cities where the consumers are enough to power about 3 7 million homes on a hot summer day companies organizations general electric
3674989 well well well if your memory in that branch of it goes back long enough 10 years then you will say together with us nice words but we have heard them before and when we acted within the scheme we got heavily burned and a bunch of gov

3675058 the big question for me was did i want to be part of a network which had developed a mortgage club or a mortgage club that had developed a network i wanted to broker the best deals i could for my clients so i opted for mortgage intelligence at a mortgage exhibition one year i asked the staff on the lenders stands which network they would join if they were brokers and the consensus was mortgage intelligence as soon as i met a number of mortgage intelligence staff i knew it was the right decision to join the network the technology that mi uses to work with brokers is currently unrivalled there are cheaper networks out there but the hassle and ultimate cost to a brokers business if the network fails led me to look for a strong player mortgage intelligence is growing reassuringly steadily the team at mi have been a joy to deal with and the compliance back up couldnt be better

3675072 can the right wing withstand yet another scandal involving one of its own
3675073 a strong message to ukraine that its insistence on nato membership may lead to war and or its dismemberment
3675074 the mass protest actions against the exercise reflects the attitude of ukraines public opinion towards the course of the current administration toward joining the alliance
3675075 the two arguments against admitting ukraine and georgia to nato political instability in ukraine and georgias military conflict with russia have become stronger since they were raised by germany and france at the april bucharest nato summit
3675076 it is therefore unlikely that the review meeting will send a positive signal to ukraine and georgia about being granted nato maps
3675077 if georgia falls lithuania latvia and estonia will have problems
3675078 have claims to crimea in ukraine they have claims to some parts of the baltic countries they have claims to some parts of eastern europe

3675106 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3675107 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3675108 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3675109 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3675110 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3675111 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3675112 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3675113 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3675114 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3675115 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

3675133 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3675134 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3675135 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3675136 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3675137 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3675138 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3675139 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3675140 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues

3675142 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3675143 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3675144 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3675145 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3675146 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3675147 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3675148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3675149 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3675155 president george w bushs supporters have been crowing over the hamdan verdict as if it were some kind of a triumph
3675156 in truth it is a hollow victory in the war on terror a blow to americas standards of justice and image in the world
3675157 the prior political narrative was that the commissions amounted to a new inquisition if anything hamdans sentence again validates the fairness and due process safeguards embedded in the system

3675169 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3675170 lindsay refused to comment on the relationship adding in an email to the publication

3675172 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3675173 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3675174 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants
3675175 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3675176 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
3675177 schiphol is discriminating by charging passengers thatdepart from the netherlands twice as much as transferpassengers

3675197 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3675198 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3675199 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3675200 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3675201 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3675202 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3675203 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3675204 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3675205 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3675206 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3675207 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3675208 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3675209 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3675210 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3675211 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3675212 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3675213 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3675214 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3675246 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3675247 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3675248 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3675249 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3675250 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3675251 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3675252 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3675253 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3675254 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3675255 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3675256 completely reusing an old bit here but its fun so suck it
3675257 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3675258 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3675282 finally nico will perform a selection of his compositions with help from sam thomas and violist extraordinaire nadia sirota culminating in the only tune a piece nico wrote for sam and that he sam thomas and nadia premiered last year at carnegie hall

3675287 theres a huge gulf between the money a company makes and what under the tax code is deemed to be the actual amount of income subject to taxes
3675288 as a u s based company we comply with regulation and we do indeed pay corporate taxes
3675289 we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3675290 in describing 2005 a year in which corporate income tax collections rose dramatically at the state and federal levels the gao report is completely consistent with what youd expect almost all firms that were profitable reported paying taxes

3675311 i wasnt paying attention to the no hitter until the end
3675312 in the seventh inning i kind of got the feeling of what was going on i saw the scoreboard
3675313 when lovie stole that base in the fifth inning we finally capitalized
3675314 what you saw today how we put ourselves position to score a run was a function of team speed
3675315 the one thing were developing with this team is overall speed
3675316 im assuming were gonna be in some close games and base running really make a big difference when you get into a close game and all youre looking at is getting yourself into position to score and getting a key hit
3675317 its always there and you use it to do a lot of things to put pressure on a defense when youre aggressive when youre dragging the defense laterally youre opening up holes for the hitters

3675371 usavano gli acidi per trasformare il saccarosio in glucosio e fruttosio
3675372 i due acidi assieme alle altre sostanze cancerogene non uccidono subito ma lo fanno progressivamente in modo subdolo

3675406 we believe all the players involved in the incident have been identified
3675407 we have conflicting statements from witnesses and we are still investigating whether this is an issue of self defense
3675408 i think well see in the short term a lot more cases made
3675409 in the longer term hopefully it will lead to a reduction because it will be less convenient for the thieves to off load materials quickly
3675410 nothing is final until the board approves it we want to let the board of pharmacy know that we dont think they investigated what should have been investigated
3675411 to you this administrative case is about a first time disciplinary action against a young pharmacist who misfilled a prescription
3675412 this is kind of shocking because he seemed like he was indestructible i remember that he trained for a long time to ride his bike across the country

3675417 from the average persons perspective they would say that state farm mutual is doing well in the non hurricane years
3675418 its reasonable for state farm mutual to earn a profit
3675419 they are assuming a great deal of risk and they should be compensated for that risk
3675420 nobody can say where the greater frequency of hurricanes is going to go
3675421 it is extremely unlikely that the 2004 and 2005 storm sequence will reoccur
3675422 and state farms recent experience should not be cited as a reason for raising rates

3675428 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3675429 those new fans and old alike will return to the original film to enjoy and participate with the exceptional and timeless performances of tim curry richard obrien susan sarandon and the entire cast so here we go again with a new cast believing that the sky and mtv remake will add to the rocky horror phenomenon
3675430 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
3675431 our work with strategicfusion revealed that we perceive ourselves to be a leading uk charity with a world view in terms of our insight outlook and authority
3675432 however the studies also uncovered that our profile no longer fitted the direction we were taking and the organisation we want to become as we build on our successes to date and develop our roadmap
3675433 through its extensive research and strategy development strategicfusion has informed our decision making and therefore been instrumental in moving us towards meeting those goals
3675434 the ilph had staff and supporters that cared passionately about the organisation and it was critical that these stakeholders were not alienated by a change in name and logo
3675435 equally it was clear that to survive in the competitive and crowded environment in which it now operates the charity had to evolve
3675436 the trend for posting self made videos is driving the number of performances on the websites we license
3675437 hairbrush divas are not only helping to generate royalties for the writers of their favourite music but could also prove to have the x factor themselves and be our stars of tomorrow
3675438 lots more performances of music are needed online to generate meaningful royalties since each download or stream is individual in comparison to the wider audience numbers achieved by broadcasts on traditional media channels such as radio or tv
3675439 as more and more music is consumed online we need to continually develop increasingly sophisticated tracking systems in order to ensure that the songwriter and creator community is sustained enabling a continued future for music
3675440 the fact that more consumers seem to be prepared to buy prescription drugs online than simple diy items like wallpaper and garden sheds is a worrying finding and pharmaceutical organisations must use the internet to advise consumers on the dangers of this
3675441 for companies dealing in products like books and clothes it is crucial that they capitalise on the consumers willingness to purchase online by making their site as visible and usable as possible to maximise sales ahead of their competitors

3675471 there were too many bmws in the car park and i can say that because i drive one myself i had originally intended the company to become site specific but never managed it because touring used to be the big god if you toured you got funding but in order to tour you have to have a product to sell that wasnt what i wanted
3675472 the appeal was listened to and we got the funding back so all fairness to the arts council for that
3675473 i dont want to create an opera company in that sense
3675474 it offers a conduit which is the opposite of what you get across an orchestra pit with an all white cast and chorus
3675475 yes with great care i consciously set out more or less to match the demographic of the city
3675476 is that to do it well costs a lot of money
3675477 without subsidy it wont exist anyone in this show will tell you what opera can do for them that nothing else can its a luxury but so are most things these events become very important to these peoples lives they buy the cds they listen they go to see other shows

3675481 with the infinite amount of social sites and connections on the web you need to create your own short list with the highest priority items at the top that generate the most high value traffic to your content the idea is to generate as many effective touch points around the web as possible so that it will be hard not to spot your marketing activity
3675482 myspace serves as an industry leader on internet safety and we take proactive measure to protect our members
3675483 we provide users with a range of tools to enable a safer online experience
3675484 in our view myspace waited entirely too long to attempt to institute meaningful security measures that effectively increase the safety of their underage users
3675485 to oversee safety education and privacy programs and law enforcement affairs for myspace
3675486 12 among other things the myspace tos required prospective members members and users of the website to a provide truthful and accurate registration information b refrain from using any information obtained from myspace services to harass abuse or harm other people
3675487 to further a tortuous act namely intentional infliction of emotional distress
3675488 myspace has zero tolerance for those who attempt to act illegally on our site
3675489 perhaps thousands more sexual predators not registered or using fictitious names are lurking on your website
3675490 we remain concerned about the design of your site the failure to require parental permission and the lack of safeguards necessary to protect our children
3675491 we agree with the attorneys general that keeping bad people out of good places on the internet is a challenge and a priority
3675492 it requires a commitment to develop new technologies and build tight collaborations between companies law enforcement and policy makers
3675493 90 of child victims know their offender with almost half of the offenders being a family member of sexual assaults against people age 12 and up approximately 80 of the victims know the offender
3675494 from a divorced family frequented sex oriented chatrooms had the screenname evilgirl there she met a guy who after a number of conversations admitted he was 45 he flattered her sent her gifts jewelry they talked about intimate things and eventually he drove across several states to meet her for sex on several occasions in motel rooms when he was arrested in her company she was reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities
3675495 we are gravely concerned that sexual predators are using myspace to lure children into face to face encounters

3675500 my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior
3675501 lord do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone tell her then to help me
3675502 martha martha you are anxious and troubled about many things one thing is needful
3675503 you are the christ the son of the living god
3675504 he who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things
3675505 lord let me see what it is that you love about each person i meet
3675506 hey im not proud it may not be stylish but its warm for the cool fall evenings
3675507 we need to relate to people less according to what they do or omit to do and more according to what they have suffered
3675508 im glad to see you in the land of the living but sorry you are in need of our service
3675509 take this away from here this is not these peoples fight
3675510 i am all out of peanut butter what am i going to do for next week
3675511 we dont need peanut butter for another six days be anxious for nothing god will provide
3675512 it is acceptable according to what a man has not what he has not
3675513 i had to call you last night as i was on my way to serve the people i was worried because i had used the last of the peanut butter i knew i was wrong to worry so i asked god to please supply more well when i got home i couldnt get into my apartment because the entire front step was covered with jars and cans of peanut butter o me of little faith
3675514 if we only did thus and such we could solve the problem
3675515 one of the most noticeable features of eastern christianity is that it is this word mystery rather than the word sacrament which describes those actions of god which have a specific decisive and eternal significance in the lives of those who take part in them everyday substances oil water bread wine together with simple actions offering blessing washing anointing become the means by which god intervenes in our lives these interventions in which god does all the work and our only contribution is to be prepared and present color and shape our lives beyond the extent that would be possible through any human encounter however unlike most human interactions they do not take us from a place of ignorance to a place of knowledge rather the mysteries lead us deeper and deeper into the mystery the mystery which is the presence of god himself
3675516 in the east on the other hand a mystery is an area where the human mind cannot go and where the heart alone makes sense not by knowing but by being the greek word mysterion leads you into a sense of not knowing or not understanding and leaves you there all a person can do is gaze and wonder there is nothing to solve
3675517 there are two worlds for the christian and two lives in them one of these lives belongs to this world of sorrow and suffering while the other is lived in a hidden manner in the kingdom of god in the joyful city of heaven all of the events both of the gospel and of the church which are celebrated at different times of the church year are not only remembered but are also accomplished in us insofar as our souls touch this heavenly world these events become for us a higher reality a source of unceasing celebration of perfect joy
3675518 the lord reveals that upon which salvation or perdition depends and this is for all men or all nations not only for those illumined by faith in christ the principle his power of life is love the works of love and the way of love feeding those who hunger giving drink to those who thirst giving refuge to the wanderer clothing the naked visiting the sick and imprisoned not only in a bodily but in a spiritual sense these questions of the lord encompass the entire domain of relations between human beings all the possibilities of love however the question involuntarily arises is christian life reducible to charity alone does this mean that right faith christian hope the fulfillment of church decrees adherence to doctrine and prayer have no significance for salvation does this mean that heresies schisms and absence of faith do not matter if ones works are good no all these things are required of the christian and will be taken into account by the just judge but separated from love these things are the empty virtue of the arrogant pharisee or the older son in the parable of the prodigal son
3675519 is to be an icon of the holy trinity the only real structure the only real way in which the church can be formed so as to fulfil its vocation is by expressing in all its being these relationships within the holy trinity relationships of love relationships of freedom relationships of holiness
3675520 for we are not contending against flesh and blood but against the principalities against the powers against the world rulers of this present darkness against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places
3675521 i am a soldier of christ to kill is not permissible for me
3675522 our warfare is to make the dead to live not to make the living dead
3675523 christ is risen from the dead trampling down death by death
3675524 we share the grief and sufferings of serbian people who are deprived of a historic part of their country connected with the history of their spiritual cultural and national life
3675525 in 1914 russia radically reacted to the balkans events and then we lost our own country
3675526 we speak of our national guilt in the destruction of russia at least the russian orthodox church is not ashamed to speak of this serbs likewise bear guilt for what happened
3675527 but we are in sympathy with the serbian people and their church we must find the way and funds to express our solidarity
3675528 if under some circumstances the principle which underlies all international relations can be reviewed and dismantled in one case then there will certainly be a temptation to review and dismantle it in another case
3675529 just like uncountable times before the church is announcing once more today that kosovo and metohija was and must remain an integral part of serbia in accordance with un security council resolution 1244
3675530 any solution other than that represents a violation of gods justice and of human justice it represents an act of violence with long term repercussions both for the balkans and the whole of europe
3675531 the bonds of friendship between divided churches and the bridges to overcome our divisions are indispensable more now than ever love is essential so that dialogue between our churches can take place in all freedom and trust
3675532 we shall then acknowledge that the divergences that originate from the different ways in which churches respond to moral problems are not insurmountable churches witness to the gospel in different contexts
3675533 we recognize that dialogue on ethical and moral questions proceeds on the assumption that the churches are not content to agree to disagree on their respective moral teaching but that they are prepared to confront their divergences honestly and examine them in the light of doctrine worship life and holy scripture
3675534 platform at the service of its member churches and dedicated to increasing the spirit of the gospel seeking christian unity and encouraging cooperation by the churches in their social and diaconal work as they confront the acute pressing problems of humankind
3675535 are we today prepared as member churches to reaffirm the role of the council as a privileged ecumenical space where the churches will freely create networks for diakonia and for defending and promoting certain values and where by dialogue the churches will continue to break down the barriers that prevent them from recognizing one another as churches confessing a common faith administering the same baptism and celebrating the eucharist together
3675536 the love of god destroys the barriers among the peoples
3675537 and the christian confessions are making a greater effort on the path of dialogue and collaboration
3675538 the ministry of defense assured us that the conscription of clergymen will raise morality in the armed forces but these are absolutely empty words
3675539 the truth is that a priest dressed in a soldiers uniform can like any ordinary person try to exert a share of his moral resources yet fail to enrich the army with morality or guidance
3675540 you can even justify the practice of female genital mutilation
3675541 the best of women are those who are like sheep
3675542 if a woman doesnt satisfy her husbands desires she should choose herself a place in hell
3675543 your prayer will be invalid if a donkey black dog or a woman passes in front of you
3675544 some women are killed when they marry the wrong person or run away with someone they love theres also violence against women within families including sexual harassment by uncles and others this has no place in islam we have to explain that to them
3675545 we face the question of whether we are part of this community or not
3675546 one problem is one that affects all a state of lawlessness that lets extremism raise its head
3675547 there are many orthodox in the port cities in south china
3675548 greeks are working on the ships and they want a place of worship the pastoral activities are first for the orthodox greeks then for the chinese there are only a few orthodox chinese there
3675549 i want to work very closely and with more collaboration with some other christian churches here we must be together
3675550 it is a big mistake for orthodox to call themselves greek orthodox or russian orthodox we are all orthodox i come here not to change a chinese to a greek or to a russian but to let the chinese know about christ
3675551 is a sign that the teachings of jesus christ have reached the very ends of the earth we chanted the prokimen and a psalm dedicated to the apostles their sound is gone out into all lands and their words unto the ends of the earth
3675552 in whichever position the church appoints us no matter how high we must know that our leader is christ
3675553 we tend to be a country in which incarceration is an easy response to crime
3675554 being tough on crime is an easy position to take particularly if you have the money to pay the cost of having so many people in prison we did have the money in the 80s and 90s but now prison costs are blowing a hole in state budgets
3675555 armies and wars are part of this fallen world and though an undesirable inevitability and even an evil necessity a necessity none the less
3675556 adultery is part of this fallen world and though undesirable in certain circumstances a lesser evil
3675557 that have stood in my way one is uncertainty as to what type of activities would be presented to the parish i do not believe that most parish members are comfortable with peace marches and demonstrations also advocacy of peace activities in the current climate may appear to be political and this prove to be divisive not everyone shares my concerns about the growing militarization of our nation and its heavy handed activities toward other nations i would appreciate your thoughts and ideas

3675572 hr bukhari di dalam al adab al mufrad dan disahihkan oleh al albani dimakruhkan memberi salam kepada orang yang sedang di wc buang hajat karena hadits ibnu umar radhiallaahu anhuma yang menyebutkan
3675573 bahwasanya ada seseorang yang lewat sedangkan rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam sedang buang air kecil dan orang itu memberi salam maka nabi tidak menjawabnya
3675574 janganlah kalian terlebih dahulu memberi salam kepada orang orang yahudi dan nasrani
3675575 apabila ahlu kitab memberi salam kepada kamu maka jawablah wa alaikum
3675576 islam yang manakah yang paling baik jawab nabi engkau memberikan makanan dan memberi salam kepada orang yang telah kamu kenal dan yang belum kamu kenal
3675577 janganlah kalian memberi salam seperti orang orang yahudi dan nasrani karena sesungguhnya pemberian salam mereka memakai isyarat dengan tangan
3675578 tiada dua orang muslim yang saling berjumpa lalu berjabat tangan melainkan diampuni dosa keduanya sebelum mereka berpisah

3675588 people are more than happy with the regeneration work that is happening
3675589 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3675590 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3675591 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3675592 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3675593 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes

3675711 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3675712 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3675713 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3675714 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3675715 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3675716 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3675717 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change

3675729 we intend to use helicopter models as the platform for the new technology we need a vehicle that can carry cameras and various sensors as well as the control mechanisms a helicopter type unmanned vehicle would be able to hover and would be more stable than an aeroplane for specific operations
3675730 ultimately the intention would be to send several of these unmanned vehicles a swarm out at one time to enable them to cover a very large area in the shortest possible time
3675731 they would be controlled from a command base which could be a jeep roving about the area or possibly airborne but they would also be able to act autonomously for example if one uav detected a signal such as a heat source or a radio pulse from clothing or a mobile phone call it could leave the other vehicles to investigate and then return and relay its information back to base

3675803 dont go to armenia this year its dangerous people got killed
3675804 the first municipal elections in the east took place in beirut in 1875 now the armenian who has nothing in armenia wants a third of beirut how i dont understand anything of what is being said and i do not believe hizballah wants to become a protector of ethnic and religious minorities
3675805 support for using the native windows start menu where appropriate
3675806 today it was good to get close to the teams and we managed to sprint at the end and win just as we did in poznan at the final olympic qualification regatta
3675807 we usually have a very good second half of a race so when we were second at 1000m we were confident we could win
3675808 its great to be in the final it really only hit me on the pontoon im in the final i got a bit distracted at 1500m became rattled and had to sprint i think its because i saw where i was heard the crowd roar and got caught off guard then i heaved it a bit it wasnt smooth you cant just hear the crowd you can feel it its like thunder its thrilling
3675809 that race didnt feel good the final will be better i dont know what to say about getting to the final im very happy i dont want to think about my preparation now im very tired and think im going to sleep
3675810 everyone wants to be first in the semifinal but the standard is very high if i perform exceptionally in the final ill have a chance my technique is to stay in touch for the first 1500m then sprint this is down to experience when i got to 1500m i heard the first shouts of chinese team add oil and was excited then at the main grandstand i heard the crowd roar and reckoned i should go for it the crowd makes a big difference
3675811 im ecstatic over the moon to be in the final the important thing now is recovery if i hadnt got through now i would have been honest and not blamed it on my knee injury the race was brilliant it got mahe cut up from both sides christou ioannis what a guy he only jumped into the single this year but unfortunately hes on the other side of things today i came here with the intention of producing an olympic performance weve all got a chance in this final i think ive got an underdogs chance thats a good place to be
3675812 there was a break in in our greenville s c office and a number of employee laptops were taken
3675813 in the process of identifying the information contained on the laptops we discovered the personal information of about 9 000 current and former employees
3675814 typically when the theft is from a non employee or someone that is stealing it because they see a laptop and they see the value in that as something they can sell it doesnt appear in most cases that theyre aware of the information it contains
3675815 taken immediate steps to fortify the security measures that were already in place
3675816 the board of selectmen and the council on aging were very lucky to have her in the position for the time she was there
3675817 it was so rewarding to help the seniors and as the outreach worker i would go to their homes and they were so happy to see me sometimes i was the only person they would see that day
3675818 its so rewarding to help the seniors and see people being happy the seniors are so appreciative it makes me feel good to help people
3675819 the job grew with me and i learned as i went
3675820 its hard for me to leave i feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to serve people here
3675821 i cant say enough about what shes done for the seniors and for the town of rutland
3675822 we completed two full sessions before the summer with nine people in each session and there are other people who want to sign up in the fall
3675823 she has a personality that the seniors just love she gave them the individual attention and really listened to them
3675824 the real problem is youve done nothing youve done this smoke and mirrors flex route system which does not work
3675825 the sensible thing to do is have the fare go down to 50 cents for every route
3675826 you shouldnt even have put that on the table you cant take care of your weakest residents
3675827 you guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves you really should
3675828 this is putting the majority of the burden on those least able to afford it
3675829 i am the first monaco rower ever to participate in an olympic games its a great experience and im very lucky to be here it was my goal to make the final c but im still young and inexperienced and have some work to do last year i was 6th in the world rowing under 23 championships but this year only 8th because the wind conditions didnt suit me i dont get much recognition as an athlete at home but prince albert follows my progress and helps me out he gave me the great honour to carry our flag at the opening ceremony i train in lyons in france and at the french training centre monaco has five athletes here and there is a good atmosphere in the olympic village
3675830 its a serious honor to be recognized by your peers in the music community
3675831 they are both prime examples of what this industry can do to someone
3675832 i dont know im not them but i sure as hell wouldnt let it happen to me
3675833 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3675834 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3675835 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3675836 the question is where will the number level off at for china in the next few months
3675837 china is an enormous driver for the price of oil along with india brazil and the middle east
3675838 look we are not going to agree on this lets drop it and go on to something else
3675839 thanks for the apology but dont worry i figure that friends are going to step on each others toes from time to time
3675840 a proportionate response to an unprovoked assault on it citizens
3675841 no intention of annexing or occupying any part of georgia and has again affirmed its respect for its sovereignty
3675842 over the next few days on the condition that georgia refrains from military activity and keeps its forces out of the region russia will continue to take the diplomatic steps required to consolidate this temporary cessation to hostilities
3675843 the plucky republic of georgia with just a few million citizens was attacked by its giant eastern neighbour
3675844 this is not a conflict of russias making this is not a conflict of russias choosing there are no winners from this conflict
3675845 honey would you like for me to fix your breakfast
3675846 a feeling of indignant displeasure or persistent ill will at something regarded as a wrong insult or injury
3675847 what can i learn from this situation how can i grow from this
3675848 you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives
3675849 my husband and have made a covenant with each other to speak to each other in kind tones it is not always easy and sometimes we have to walk away from each other and say i cant talk with you right now until i can calm down
3675850 there are always going to be conflicts in a relationship but when you can commit to speaking to each other in kindness it is so much easier to take what the other has to say sometimes we think just because we are married to someone that we can treat them however we want we forget that when god tells us to love him first and then be loving to others he means our spouse and family as well every year we do something proactive to pour into our marriage we go to a marriage seminar or read a marriage book a good marriage doesnt just happen it takes work but i would say that decision to speak to each other in kind tones has been one of the most significant decisions we have made
3675851 therefore as gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion
3675852 be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven you
3675853 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3675854 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3675855 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3675856 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3675857 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3675858 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3675859 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps he is not from another planet he is from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now he is an average swimmer but he has come back here to mop up
3675860 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3675861 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3675862 the last few weeks this ballclub has really been playing hard
3675863 and then the addition of manny has certainly picked up the personality of this club we feel this is an important week for us
3675864 it seems like its been a long time since ive been out there
3675865 it was good to be able to throw strikes again
3675866 i think a combination of not getting some wins over there in oakland and then coming over here in a trade and trying to justify the trade i think he put too much pressure on himself
3675867 and i think finally he just kicked back and relaxed a bit
3675868 that is so special that you can share this as mother and daughter
3675869 three years ago i couldnt stand to be around my mother
3675870 i harbored a lot of anger and bitterness toward my mom for some things she did during my growing up years
3675871 my mom apologized and it helped me to forgive her
3675872 i cried when i realized what i had done to my kids because of the circumstances of my divorce i went to each of them and asked for forgiveness not to make excuses but to ask for forgiveness
3675873 before there was tension in our relationship now we look for time to be together and enjoy doing things together she even called me the other day instead of calling a friend that was so special to me
3675874 allah melaknat orang orang yahudi allah mengharamkan mereka makan lemak babi tetapi mereka mengumpulkannya lalu menjualnya dan makan harganya
3675875 they s hard when im in the middle of something that i need to focus on because i run my business out of my home
3675876 learn healthy ways to resolve the conflicts because conflicts are an integral part of every relationship
3675877 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3675878 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3675879 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3675880 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3675881 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3675882 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3675883 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3675884 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3675885 im sorry i thought id already dealt with all of this
3675886 its okay let yourself cry i know its sad for you
3675887 thank you for thinking of me and your concern i didnt realize there was still a tender spot there
3675888 i have about 10 20 or 30 minutes to talk or however long her drive is
3675889 i just want to let you know i have five minutes left
3675890 i love talking to you and would love to talk longer and a friend is coming over in about 10 min so when she comes ill have to go
3675891 but the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure then peace loving
3675892 im sorry i am a little distracted were on our way home from the hospital where their mother just died i dont suppose they quite know how to deal with it
3675893 be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other
3675894 this last option becomes the first in order not to let the situation go out of hand
3675895 kashmiris will continue to agitate peacefully and we should not give indian oppressors any chance to use brute force
3675896 the central government must give the land to the amarnath shrine board otherwise our protest will continue
3675897 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3675898 owing to a belief that there was a potential threat to life the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident police negotiators are also at the scene in a bid to bring the incident to a safe conclusion
3675899 the police intention remains to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved these efforts are still ongoing
3675900 the history was begun in the midst of challenges to smiths authority primarily initiated by bishop edward partridge in missouri which evoked smiths introduction of the office of president of the high priesthood it is therefore not simply an autobiographical sketch but an apology setting forth smiths credentials as leader of the church the history therefore contains the earliest account of what is known as his first vision and earliest mention of angelic priesthood ordinations
3675901 our whole strength rests on the validity of that vision it either occurred or it did not if it did not then this work is a fraud salt lake tribune october 7 2002
3675902 which led me to searching the scriptures believing as i was taught that they contained the word of god thus applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly for i discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and godly conversation agreeable to what i found contained in that sacred depository thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen i pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world of mankind my mind become exceedingly distressed for i become convicted of my sins and by searching the scriptures i found that mankind did not come unto the lord but that they had apostatised from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of jesus christ as recorded in the new testament
3675903 to know which of all the sects was right that i might know which to join for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong
3675904 and when i considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth therefore i cried unto the lord for mercy for there was none else to whom i could go and obtain mercy and the lord heard my cry in the wilderness and while in the attitude of calling upon the lord in the 16th year of my age a piller of light above the brightness of the sun at noon day come down from above and rested upon me and i was filled with the spirit of god and the lord opened the heavens upon me and i saw the lord and he spake unto me saying joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee
3675905 i have read and believed his testimony of his great first vision in which he conversed with the father and the son i have pondered the wonder of that as i have stood in the grove where he prayed and in that environment by the power of the spirit i have received a witness that it happened as he said it happened
3675906 my mind become exceedingly distressed for i become convicted of my sins and by searching the scriptures i found that mankind did not come unto the lord but that they had apostatised from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination
3675907 for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong
3675908 joseph smith claimed that while experiencing his first vision he was told that the creeds of christendom were an abomination in gods sight

3675912 el amor aut ntico es ciertamente bueno cuando amamos somos plenamente humanos pero a menudo se cree amar cuando en realidad se tiende a poseer o a manipular a la otra persona a veces los dem s son tratados como objetos para satisfacer las propias necesidades qu f cil es ser enga ado por las tantas voces que en nuestra sociedad sostienen un enfoque permisivo de la sexualidad sin prestar atenci n a la modestia al respeto propio y a los valores morales que confieren calidad a las relaciones humanas
3675913 i believe the bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers ignorant translators careless transcribers or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors
3675914 many versions of the bible are available today unfortunately no original manuscripts of any portion of the bible are available for comparison to determine the most accurate version however the lord has revealed clearly the doctrines of the gospel in these latter days the most reliable way to measure the accuracy of any biblical passage is not by comparing different texts but by comparison with the book of mormon and modern day revelations
3675915 the words contained in this bible are merely a history of what is gone by it was never given to guide the servant of god in the course he should pursue any more than the words and commandments of god given to a generation under one set of circumstances would serve for another generation under another set of circumstances there must be something to suggest or to draw forth the command to answer the circumstance under which we are placed at the time
3675916 who in his right mind could for one moment believe the bible in its present form to be a perfect guide who knows that even one verse has escaped pollution so as to convey the same sense now that it did in the original
3675917 as all informed persons know the various versions of the bible do not accurately record or perfectly preserve the words thoughts and intents of the original inspired authors
3675918 the book of mormon has been is now and will forever remain secure in the hands of the servants of the lord for which we are immeasurably grateful but with the bible it was not and is not so it is now in the hands of intellectuals and unbelievers and ministers whose delight it is to twist and pervert its doctrines and to spiritualize away the plain meanings of all its important parts and it once was in the sole and exclusive care and custody of an abominable organization founded by the devil himself likened prophetically unto a great whore whose great aim and purpose was to destroy the souls of men in the name of religion
3675919 the latter day saint use of the bible differs from the judeo christian norm because it is not the sole lds source of authority see scripture authority of scripture the bible is interpreted and understood by latter day saints through four important means 1 other lds scriptures which enrich and give perspective to an understanding of biblical teachings 2 statements of modern prophets and apostles on the meaning of some biblical passages 3 the joseph smith translation of the bible and 4 personal revelation through the gift of the holy ghost enhancing the comprehension of the scriptures consequently latter day saints are not left without information about the meaning of many difficult passages that have divided the entire christian world for two millennia
3675920 during the dark ages during the black millennium if you will even the bible that now is was kept from the people many is the martyr who suffered death by fire for reading or possessing biblical manuscripts the translation and publication of the scriptural word was opposed with satanic fury in that day for the present the devil has lost that round today he centers his powers on denying the authenticity of the scriptures and using them to prove such false doctrines as that god is a spirit or that we are saved by grace alone without works
3675921 the final contribution of the prophet to our understanding of the apocalypse is in the actual work he did on the text of revelation as part of his inspired translation of the bible as was noted above he deleted from added to or changed a total of ninety verses obviously not every one of those changes are of equal significance the committee that worked on the lds edition of the king james version included changes for only forty seven of the ninety verses or just slightly better than half of the total changes
3675922 why is it if the jst is not really complete have any of the so called
3675923 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
3675924 it is clear the bible has a different weight to mormons than it does us it is viewed entirely differently and seems important but not important at the same time it is as if they give it lip service but behind the scenes dismiss it
3675925 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was divine
3675926 if we look at a different verse 2 corinthians 4 4 we find the exact same word ho theos that was used in john 1 1 to describe god almighty is now used to describe the devil however now the system of translation has been changed
3675927 the god of this world the devil hath blinded the minds of them which believe not
3675928 so what theyre saying is that wicked men took out the parts that promoted a lifestyle of sex with young girls
3675929 here is a quote from a website about john 1 1 written by someone who knows the language
3675930 he fact that so many on this site are former mormons is a witness to me that god is saving the mormons he saved me from mormonism and he will save more
3675931 we believe teach and confess that the sole rule and standard according to which all dogmas together with all teachers should be estimated and judged are the prophetic and apostolic scriptures of the old and of the new testament alone as it is written ps 119 105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and st paul though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you let him be accursed gal 1 8
3675932 some questions ive puzzled out on my own for instance when nephi begins the small plates which would replace the lost 116 he says the things which are pleasing unto the world i do not write but the things which are pleasing unto god
3675933 im guessing that means the 116 were filled with things pleasing unto the world stories about battles war heroes kings and betrayals if so the book of mormon may be a more spiritual book because those pages were lost
3675934 account engraven upon the plates of nephi is more particular
3675935 still the one question that troubles many people never troubles me joseph smith pleaded with god several times to let martin take the 116 pages and was told no but joseph went back one more time and god reversed himself he let martin take the pages and he lost them
3675936 why would god give his consent to such a debacle
3675937 it is i who tempted the wrath of god i should have been satisfied with the first answer
3675938 well you need to keep praying keep asking until he tells you it is true
3675939 if im right and the book of mormon is more spiritual without those lost 116 pages maybe having martin misplace the things was simply gods way of editing the book
3675940 by way of commandment and also by the spirit of prophesy and revelation written and sealed up and hid up unto the lord that they might not be destroyed
3675941 maybe having martin misplace the things was simply gods way of editing the book
3675942 id bet most mormons do not know about this because of its obvious problems
3675943 it is obvious to me that joseph knew he messed up and could not duplicate the same story with the exactness needed so he came up with this way of re telling it while allowing for the same basic story but different words
3675944 while peter was still speaking these words the holy spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the messaage
3675945 believe in the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved
3675946 on the topic of the 116 pages why has no one engaged the js argument up front
3675947 on what basis does the holy spirit testify that joseph smith is a true prophet of god
3675948 of course you believe the holy ghost is all over everything lds what else is a true believing mormon to say
3675949 but also some of the jewish exorcist who went from place to place attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying i adjure you by jesus whom paul preaches and seven sons of one sceva a jeewish chief priest were doing this and the evil spirit answered and said to them i recognize jesus and i know about paul but who are you and the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them and subdued both of them and overpowered them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
3675950 you avoid the question how would we know that it is indeed the hs that testified to js other than he js told us he the spirit did
3675951 just because we existed in the mind or purpose or plan of god eternally before the foundation of the world etc does not mean that we were pre existent spiritual entities
3675952 skipped over your adoption topic it doesnt make much sense to me i dont need to be adopted by god because he is the real father of my spirit no adoption necessary
3675953 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name bear witness about me but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock john 10 25 26
3675954 you are merely comfortable in your testimony culture and experience
3675955 quit praying about the bom and open the bible you dont need new revelation
3675956 back you up on what after all you guys cannot agree on much
3675957 because it doesnt conform to my interpretation of the scriptures
3675958 i cant think of any statement that could be more offensive i am mormon by conviction not by tradition thank you very much
3675959 i dont need new revelation on the bom for sure because my answer in years past has been complete and unquestionable
3675960 i would say the adoption verses you reference should apply to adoption into the family of abraham since they were delivered to gentiles you dont find christ metioning adoption to the jews who were already part of that family
3675961 know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of abraham
3675962 you totally missed the point you dont need new revelation at all not just about the bom everything you need to know about god and about yourself to be saved is in the bible
3675963 yes rex speaks for you guys by saying this is what we believe
3675964 the only real difference in this respect between the bible and the bom is that the bom is free from human translation errors and loss of material
3675965 oh yeah if it isnt written in the bible it cant be truth im getting pretty tired of that dogmatic dull and stale point of view
3675966 so if we go by the meaning of father as
3675967 in that they received the word with all readiness of mind
3675968 acts 17 11 the reason they accepted the new revelation was not only based on the holy spirits power and personal drawing but the truths proclaimed by peter paul etc were in alignment with the rest of scripture and the ot prophecies
3675969 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
3675970 all i am saying is that on the day of pentecost these believers did accept peter and the apostles based on being pricked in the heart
3675971 the saints had been despised unwanted and hunted down orders had been issued to shoot them on sight and their prophet joseph smith had been murdered by an illinois mob in june 1844 the saints knew if they stayed in illinois their days were numbered
3675972 one of my great grandmothers several times removed was forced to flee missouri after governor lilburn boggs issued an extermination order basically making it legal to shoot mormons on sight
3675973 fact up until the 1970s it was legal in the state of ohio to shoot a mormon on sight
3675974 at one point the governor of missouri even issued an extermination order which mandated that any mormons who refused to leave the state were to be shot on sight
3675975 an extermination order is issued by a person in governnmental control when gov milburn boggs did that it made it legal to shoot a mormon on sight man woman or child not sure if there was a bounty or not but it was legal to mass murder it was open season on mormons
3675976 this action was a concerted effort on the part of state officials to cause them church members to be driven from the state
3675977 and that mob that comes on us to disturb us it shall be between them and us a war of extermination for we will follow them till the last drop of their blood be spilled or else they will have to exterminate us for we will carry the seat of war to their own houses and their own families and one party or the other shall be utterly destroyed remember it then all men
3675978 mobs against the mormons menacingly rode through the mormon communities determined to wage a war of extermination
3675979 boggs acting in his capacity as commander in chief of the missouri militia ordered general john b
3675980 hundreds of mormons were beaten lynched murdered looted tarred and raped under color of executive order number 44 the so called
3675981 at that point in time js had not entertained any ideas on pologamy
3675982 i do not believe that the people of the north have any more right to say that the south shall not hold slaves than the south have to say the north shall the first mention we have of slavery is found in the holy bible and so far from that prediction being averse to the mind of god it slavery remains as a lasting monument of the decree of jehovah to the shame and confusion of all who have cried out against the south in consequence of their holding the sons of ham in servitude
3675983 are the mormons abolitionists no unless delivering the people from priestcraft and the priests from the power of satan should be considered abolition
3675984 a collection of authoritative mormon utterances on the being and nature of god
3675985 the task before me on this occasion is to take this subject and present to you what in reality the church of jesus christ of latter day saints teaches with reference to the godhead
3675986 the one eternal living god is triune one god in three persons the god who meets us in the testimony of israel is the same god who meets us in jesus christ and who indwells creation as the holy spirit god is the eternal creator the source of love life and truth all things that exist owe their being to god who alone is worthy of our worship
3675987 behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have
3675988 missionary discussion have changed to a nonstructured format but in my day first lesson first principle was god the father distinct being of flesh and bone by the way most of my christian friends believe this wholeheartedly and insist their minister would agree maybe you should enlighten them
3675989 they will also continue to organize people redeem and perfect other systems which are now in the womb of chaos and thus go on increasing their several dominions till the weakest child of god which now exists upon the earth will possess
3675990 while at the same time jesus christ and his father will have
3675991 they say young is teaching a doctrine that makes no sense with the rest of his lifes teachings
3675992 consider if jesus atonement has made one perfect and god remembers those sins no more then when resurrection and judgment comes is that man sinful or perfect if god remembers the sins no more than that man cannot be sinful which means that he must be perfect as he is without sin
3675993 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
3675994 i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high
3675995 forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans device
3675996 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together
3675997 the instruction that we are to worship god in spirit does that mean we must leave our bodies to worship him
3675998 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are
3675999 that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us

3676003 i prefer to store the memories that still linger of open spaces fields and watermelons olive and almond trees

3676005 there has been much discussion about where mahmoud should be laid to rest
3676006 before settling on ramallah the palestinian leadership suggested a request should be made to israel to let him be buried here in judeidi but mahmoud was never a son of judeidi his soul belonged to birwa
3676007 i would like my son to be buried here but he isnt just my son hes the entire arab worlds son
3676008 mahmoud and his poetry belonged to the whole palestinian people and it is better that his final resting place is where all palestinians can visit him

3676022 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3676023 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3676024 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3676025 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3676026 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3676027 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3676028 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly

3676052 we know whisky makes cars go the question now is will we be allowed to distil our own and instead of drinking it just pour it into our vehicles
3676053 its all about cost but with the way things are going whisky may end up being cheaper than petrol

3676057 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image

3676113 non c dubbio che dobbiamo puntare a questo risultato avverte ma dato che si tratta di un obiettivo molto ambizioso e non sappiamo nel dettaglio in che modo raggiungerlo dovremmo essere pronti ad adattarci a quattro gradi in pi
3676114 anche se riusciamo a mettere insieme il miglior accordo possibile per ridurre i gas serra dichiara al guardian da un punto di vista razionale dobbiamo comunque prepararci a un 20 per cento di eventualit di rischio e quindi penso che watson abbia ragione quando indica il dato dei 4 gradi non c da scegliere tra mitigazione e adattamento bisogna perseguire entrambi

3676140 i thought he was oddly old time looking charming in a scraggly way his jeans were as rumpled as his shirt and even in the hot weather he had on the black corduroy cap he always wore he made me think of harpo marx impish and approachable but there was something about him that broadcast an intensity that was not to be taken lightly
3676141 bobby had an impish charm that older women found endearing he had a touch of arrogance a good dose of paranoia and a wonderful sense of the absurd but bobby was also tough and focused and he had a healthy ego the additional ingredients protected the intensive sensitivity as an artist he had what it took to become a success

3676144 bob wanted a shearling jacket to wear for his picture on the cover of the first album but there was no way he could afford a real one we finally found a synthetic shearling in a shop in the village that looked pretty good almost like the real thing bob carefully adjusted the collar just so he was ready for his self titled close up
3676145 accusations of plagiarism would always be a ball and chain on dylans career as a songwriter but especially in the early years now and then he acknowledged possible crossovers one night he burst into the kettle of fish club waving a piece of paper and announcing to sylvia tyson hey you gotta listen to this song i just wrote i just wrote it or at least i think i wrote it but maybe i heard it somewhere
3676146 quietly bob said this is the beginning of what i have always known i am going to be big he said it calmly and knowingly and it was true no bragging no look at me no aint i grand that was not his way he spoke only what he knew to be true
3676147 bob always did as he saw fit he was rarely swayed by outside demands or requests he went where he wanted to go even if it meant alienating his public fans friends and lovers he did not make anything easy for anyone or for himself
3676148 after the freewheelin bob dylan had been out awhile at parties i noticed that people would approach him with reverence and tell him involved stories about their lives and then wait for him to speak they wanted him to suggest solutions for them to enlighten them in some way it made him uneasy he wanted to make music not address a congregation
3676149 joan baez was a big star in the folk music world bob was the new fast rising star their convergence was predictable baez and dylans professional appearances were exciting and provoked gossip about an affair at first it was just gossip then of course it wasnt

3676156 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3676157 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3676158 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3676159 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3676160 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3676161 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3676181 i am looking for a way out because nobody likes this situation it is evident that the club does not count on me because in pre season i have not trained with the team
3676182 if you are made to train on your own it is because the coach does not want you
3676183 i have never had the chance for a regular run because new signings always came in and the front positions are always very competitive
3676184 last season i played 30 games for c diz but it was not an easy season because the club had two presidents and four coaches and the team was relegated
3676185 to score ten goals in a team that went down is not bad though

3676194 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3676195 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3676196 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3676197 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3676198 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value

3676201 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3676202 im really happy at liverpool and i want to stay here for as long as the club wants me
3676203 i am really settled here and i like the city the most important thing is i like the club and ive really enjoyed the two seasons ive been here the only thing i am missing is some trophies and hopefully that will come in the next year
3676204 ive never had any intentions of leaving this club sometimes things are said in the press but the boss said to me that is not relevant and he wants me here with liverpool
3676205 the team has been working really hard and the new players have adapted well
3676206 the last three games we have had some good results against rangers valerenga and lazio but lets see where we are after this week if we start well on wednesday and then against sunderland in the premier league on saturday then we will have had a good pre season
3676207 we know that we are a good team we have a lot of confidence and weve just got to show that in the first games of the season
3676208 i know a bit about liege belgium is close to holland and i know their league maybe it isnt as good as a couple of years ago but they are still a good team with a few talented young players
3676209 it will definitely be tough for us and hopefully we can get a good result
3676210 this is a really important game for us so early in the season because we know if we were to lose we would be out of the champions league thats not what we want because we have had some really good results in that competition over the past few years
3676211 i have always played as a striker in my career but in the national team i have played on the right
3676212 i played there during euro 2008 for holland im not really a right winger but i can play it my own way and i like it so far the last 15 games of last season went really well we were playing well as a team and i was scoring goals and giving assists
3676213 as long as i can be important for the team im happy to play on the right side for me the most important thing is winning games and picking up trophies that is more important to me than being a striker and scoring goals
3676214 i dont care if i play as a striker a second striker or a right winger i just want to play as many games as i can and be important for the team
3676215 everyone knows him because he has played at a really good level for many years in the premier league

3676237 we thank the swiss government not only for the values of freedom and civil rights that are enshrined in its culture but also for its willingness to share in its experience of federalism through the institute of federalism located in fribourg in switzerland which has been helping us do our studies on this form of government we advocate federalism as a way to ensure long lasting peace in mindanao
3676238 we have made progress but we will need your support to get the job done for the fundamental change in our political system
3676239 our present form of government has many gridlocks which have become a hindrance to our socio economic growth
3676240 i said the search for peace must be constitutional but the constitution must serve the quest for peace and i believe that we have a better chance for lasting peace and development in mindanao if indeed we have a federal form of government
3676241 federalism is not merely a political form it will have substantive implications on the political economy of the nation therefore we must address the issue of economic viability and the preparedness of component states from our present situation as an archipelago the next transition is now to gear towards a wider distribution of economic zones such as those pioneered successfully right here in china then towards autonomy and then to statehood as for the shift to the parliamentary form of government it must be spearheaded i believe and again it must be spearheaded by meaningful political reforms particularly a law on political parties that would spur the rehabilitation of our societal organizations and mass movements and cleaning up of our electoral processes
3676242 ours is a country divided the story of our nation is a tale of two philippines almost as it were two countries under the same name
3676243 perhaps we politicians have done our best but maybe our best is not enough given the present system perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit it is time to turn to the people bring them into government and change the way that government is done
3676244 the economic progress and social stability of the provinces along with the increasing self reliance and efficiency of political developments and public services there make a compelling case for federalism perhaps its time to take the power from the center to the countryside that feeds it

3676295 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3676296 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3676297 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3676298 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3676300 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3676301 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3676302 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3676303 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3676304 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3676305 but in this case these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry
3676306 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3676307 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3676308 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds

3676401 so i think every coach has always been through a team that does something that you try different things and thought you had it covered and it just didnt work that day
3676402 it happens it just happens if you play things like that are going to happen
3676403 some days youre going to be that way some days the other teams going to be that way and thats why theyre emphasizing defense because a lot of those teams shoot the ball well
3676404 villanova shot the ball extremely well against a very good defensive team that may have been my best defensive team so its hard to say theres nothing you can do but try to make adjustments try to put in wrinkles and try to see what you can do
3676405 any time you beat a team such as the u s who was favored youve got to make plays youve got to have things like that happen and they did
3676406 its no different than trying to beat the boston celtics for the championship for us youre not going to beat them unless you make plays and then some things have got to go your way and they made plays
3676407 when you run it to perfection its not easy to stop it and thats what they did

3676417 transnational kidnappings are a new way of operating for these criminal groups mainly in california and so we are seeking collaboration with the united states
3676418 we have seen an increase in the number of kidnappings of u s citizens in tijuana including cross border abductions
3676419 the break up of the arellano felix organization has not been as complete as we would have wished they have moved into other activities such as kidnapping
3676420 rising food prices and some real concerns about our ability to supply food to countries such as india and china as their wealth increases raise the question of how nz and its food growing should be positioned to do the best that we can

3676465 the idea i had for the role was very different from the other actors
3676466 what i believe in my personal life is definitely my personal life and what i do as a career is definitely different but at the same time its a battle because youre dealing with the church and people there that you knew and you grew up with but you have a responsibility as an actor to play a role you have a responsibility to do what youre paid to do
3676467 ive never seen people at mcdonalds saying im a christian burger flipper
3676468 i look over and i see them and theyre proud of what i do but theres still that line

3676470 kind of like the temptations and all the singers that started singing in church
3676471 that was the platform i started in church i would do some comedy or i would have people laughing in church all the time then i would do little shows in detroit and then when i was 17 i flew out here on my spring break my senior year and did my three minutes at the laugh factory and got discovered that was my humble beginning
3676472 at first the role was just a rapper but i brought in my props i come from a sketch comedy too i just brought more layers to the role the other guy wasnt going to that level
3676473 i feel like some people are just right for certain roles and it was just meant to happen
3676474 the challenge was really going toe to toe with all these big stars the challenge was knowing that these guys are veterans
3676475 but it really did start to flow you start learning

3676491 if i stripped down and fingered my pussy for you do you think youd want to keep me after class and do me
3676492 not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3676493 its really fun when you get your hands into it and you get dirty and being a woman and learning how to shingle a roof thats an amazing experience all on its own
3676494 we used to build about 6 a year and now were building about 30 to 50 and so we dont have the pool of volunteers like we used to have
3676495 because of the heat and because people are on vacation and so theyre out of town
3676496 ik ben er tamelijk zeker van dat we zullen komen tot een internationale oplossing waarin ook europa betrokken is
3676497 it was really good work by birgit to get by two defenders
3676498 its typical birgit to go like that and win it but as a forward i have to expect and anticipate that the goalkeeper will not be able to hold that shot
3676499 i dont think the result is because japans was a fantastic performance
3676500 after 3 1 down we got the message that the united states was three or four goals up and we needed a get a point in order to win the group
3676501 we gambled and put more players up front and a few less in defense and japan was very good at counter attack
3676502 the most important thing for us is to forget the game and start thinking about the quarterfinal against brazil
3676503 going up that early in the game was just an awesome start for us
3676504 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3676505 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3676506 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3676507 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3676508 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3676509 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behaviour that looks like its from another time
3676510 could be swept under the rug by a casual onlooker
3676511 it looks great plays great and despite its few moments of inaccuracies is still one of the best sports games in memory
3676512 treat my wife with the same respect you would have for me she speaks for me

3676559 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these
3676560 i have been hearing accusation that this was georgian bombing and this is not true
3676561 the russian have behaved without question in an atrocious way with utterly disproprtionate force they have caused civilian deaths and destroyed civilan property
3676562 but there needs to be some accounting at some point for what the georgians have done in all this effectively starting the war in the first place with the monumental barrage of tskhinvali the south ossetian capital
3676563 i stood there for eight hours on friday there was nothing but brief cessations in the enormous artillery barrage pounding a town no bigger that a large suburb of london the destruction and damage caused there which we believe could have accounted for 2 000 lives was not done by the russians

3676571 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment due to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing

3676591 he played in the arena league and they dont have any tight ends there

3676713 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3676714 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3676715 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3676716 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3676717 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3676718 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3676719 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3676720 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3676721 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
3676722 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
3676723 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
3676724 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine
3676725 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
3676726 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
3676727 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
3676728 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
3676729 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
3676730 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
3676731 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3676732 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3676733 we can breathe in space they just dont want us to escape
3676734 its a proven fact that dark colors are more depressing
3676735 at first i agreed with the sentiment here but then i remembered that this isnt an lts release so itll be here for 6 months and then onto 9 04 if they cant try a dark theme for 6 months when can they try you shouldnt be giving granma a non lts release anyway should you
3676736 i would give give ubuntu kudos however because i find its default theme more pleasing than the blue or green themes you see on other distros
3676737 i dislike the blue myself because of windows and the green of other distros makes me want to vomit

3676740 cloud seeding a form of weather modification is the attempt to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud the usual intent is to increase precipitation rain or snow but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports

3676748 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3676749 the starters success will let you play a long time
3676750 keep playing well now and then get an opportunity to play into the late fall
3676751 any time your starters are pitching that well and getting outs quickly you have more time to hit
3676752 if they hit those balls in milwaukee theyre not coming back
3676753 there were some plays where the ballpark helped me cam did a great job out there running the ball down but im not pitching to the ballpark
3676754 he made his pitches but it was a tough game for us
3676755 we hit a lot of balls well that were outs he had luck on his side
3676756 that thing looked like it was shot out of a cannon
3676757 those are fun home runs to watch because it was smoked
3676758 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3676759 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3676760 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3676761 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3676762 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3676763 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours

3676767 i am a cow and i will get fat eating this
3676768 if you find it filling up that fast you might like to think about getting a 64 page passport
3676769 we say that it will take ten working days but it never really takes that long
3676770 ok but i will be away when it comes back in any case i am leaving tomorrow for a few weeks
3676771 give us everything you have and we will let you use it too
3676772 demands the u s administration to deal firmly with this desecration to make the soldier an example for others in the future
3676773 such offenses have occurred frequently during the past few years and apology is no more enough and the u s military has to take stronger measures to honor values of muslims

3676775 the cctv images recovered clearly show the intent of the offenders who tried to force their way behind the counter of the post office
3676776 thankfully no one was injured however the type of weapons used and the level of force shown in the attempted robbery demonstrates how dangerous these individuals are i would ask anyone who may recognise the offenders from their clothing or who perhaps knows who is responsible to come forward and speak to police
3676777 the size of the reward would depend on the nature of the information received but if it did lead to a conviction it would be substantial nobody was hurt in the incident although the staff involved were understandably shaken we are working closely with the police investigation
3676778 these closures will affect vulnerable individuals the most as they will be unable to access vital local services the post office network acts as a focal point for many local communities in stockport and yet this government seems content to let it crumble
3676779 local businesses already under long term pressure and now faced by the more acute problems of an economic down turn will also suffer
3676780 post offices provide an important social and economic benefit to individuals and local communities closing down local offices undermines those benefits and reduces social cohesion and inclusion
3676781 we believe the plan offers customers in this area the best prospects for a sustainable network in future bearing in mind the governments minimum access criteria and other factors the government has asked us to consider
3676782 i want to know why lend lease have let down stockport after years of negotiation and investment
3676783 lend lease have invested millions of pounds in consulting and preparing plans but on friday afternoon they told us they could no longer proceed we all understand the credit crunch is having an effect but their action is bitterly disappointing
3676784 this is a prestige site which offers major opportunities to the right developer this is obviously a setback but we are big enough to deal with it and we are determined enough to move forward positively
3676785 nobody could have foreseen the level of the economic problem its no criticism of the council and i dont think its any criticism of us
3676786 if you are asking me if we have let the council down then no absolutely not and its not a debate i would like to get into in public we have been working with the council for over two years now and have spent millions on this process the next stage would have been the planning application and we have told the council we are not in the position to commit further capital sums to the project
3676787 i have no doubt at some point there will be a development on the bridgefield site and it will prove to be viable at some point but i have no idea what time frame we are talking about
3676788 there has to be some investment i wouldnt be happy to bring a shopper from abroad to stockport but i think this project was badly conceived badly pitched and they didnt do their homework from the start
3676789 we have been told absolutely nothing so i am very peeved we were in limbo though so now we can start out as new i know if we ended up moving to underbank i wouldnt have been able to afford the rent so it is great news but its just unfortunate nobody came and told us themselves i think shop owners should be the first to know
3676790 actually its good for us its difficult to find somewhere else as good as this and find new customers i am a bit surprised because of what they have done to regenerate nearby towns like ashton it does need some modernisation
3676791 we are finding that the sales which are going through are all top end properties there is still interest in houses costing 500 0000 upwards because people with money can still afford to buy
3676792 but we are not selling anything at the lower end at all and first time buyers have completely dried up
3676793 i think you can see the quality of bramhall coming through there
3676794 but i would speculate that there is a time delay on these figures and that eventually areas like bramhall will experience the same fall in prices
3676795 we are still selling houses but nothing like as many as we were this time last year we have actually started to do a lot more part exchanges and house swaps house prices in poynton were high last year which is probably why prices began to fall here before anywhere else
3676796 nobody seems to know where the housing market is going to level out prices can not keep falling and they will have to bottom out eventually in fact the quicker prices fall the quicker they will bounce back and recover
3676797 it is disappointing that i lost naomi and i shoot together all the time and we know each others strengths and weakness and i dont think my strengths were very strong during that match
3676798 i shot really well against the chinese archer in my first match shooting against a home favourite in that stadium and winning was a highlight for me
3676799 i dont know why i started badly against naomi i think my sight mark was slightly off but i adjusted it and started hitting the middle it wasnt a technical problem so i cant moan about that
3676800 i approached the match in the same way i had approached the team event which went really well for me
3676801 it is a bit harder in the individual event as i am under the spotlight by myself and my nerves were really going
3676802 but that is usually when i shine through in the big high pressure matches it is all a good experience and i will build on it
3676803 beijing has been amazing it has given me invaluable experience in the team and individual events
3676804 the olympic village competing the transport and the preparation are all things i will take forward to london 2012
3676805 i will build on it for four years time but now i will take some time off go on a holiday and go skiing and hopefully not break my arm
3676806 then i will go back to training and work with all the team and people behind the scenes it will be good to go back and work on all aspects of my game
3676807 i will work as hard as i can to give myself the best chance in 2012 and we will see what happens in four years time
3676808 i can still improve massively but i know i will have to put the hours in
3676809 it has been a fantastic experience and actually one of the best experiences of my life so far it is amazing to be in the athletes village especially when the two girls got medals there was such a buzz
3676810 the boys will have to step up to the plate but we have got some very talented swimmers both male and female
3676811 just being in this environment has been such a learning curve for me and that experience will be invaluable in four years
3676812 it was a hard race a lot harder than the heats i gave it everything and i was a little bit disappointed not to make the final
3676813 i have gone past my personal best time twice here so i performed really well
3676814 i was separated from phelps by one swimmer so fortunately i was not getting all his big waves
3676815 i didnt notice him and i just concentrated on my lane and that gave me the best chance of doing a good job
3676816 it was the first time i have swum against him i got my parents to video the race and i will look back on it and i will always have that memory
3676817 i am disappointed that we didnt manage to make eighth place and reach the team final
3676818 there was more in the tank and they never released it they produced maybe 10 per cent less than in training i think nerves got to them
3676819 but i am delighted that beth has achieved the first part of her dream and reached the bar final
3676820 today the job was to go out and win that race
3676821 we were all just so happy and excited when we were singing the national anthem
3676822 we were all out of tune it was quite funny listening to us all trying to sing god save the queen
3676823 theres a feeling in the team that we can get lots more medals
3676824 it was phenomenal when they got their medals and then i was really excited and pumped up to come and do my races
3676825 it is looking good for next week we have got the momentum we have already matched what we did in athens
3676826 it is going to build up as the week goes on and hopefully carry over into the open water with metro club mate cassie patten myself and david davies
3676827 i did actually think i would hurt that much after 200m because i am going to hurt way more than this after 10k
3676828 it would not be possible for us to invite the next chair if it is from the government of zimbabwe or to have contacts with the chair

3676830 mit blick auf die zukunft eine wirkliche rolle bei der weiteren stabilisierung bernehmen
3676831 wenn wir ber friedenserhaltung sprechen dann sollte die europ ische union eine zentrale rolle spielen
3676832 wir brauchen dort eine internationale pr senz die osze ist bereit ihre schon vorhandene infrastruktur zur verf gung zu stellen
3676833 ein internationales system der friedenssicherung geben wird an dem die eu entweder im zivilen krisenmanagement oder milit risch mit friedenstruppen beteiligt ist
3676834 einer sehr harten diskussion ber die eu russland beziehungen in der zukunft
3676835 derzeit ben die russen die v llige kontrolle aus und es gibt keine anzeichen daf r dass die russen irgendjemand anderen nach s dossetien hineinlassen ob die osze da wieder hineinkommt und ob die vereinten nationen in abchasien berleben k nnen das ist alles sehr sehr unklar

3676840 star bulk denies liability and would vigorously contest any claims that might be brought by tmt
3676841 we believe it is important to focus on opportunities for further fleet expansion thereby creating long term shareholder value
3676842 our strong balance sheet which is approximately 27 of our debt to fleet value provides us with the ability to look for further fleet growth
3676843 it is always nice to come back from two nil down it feels like a victory sometimes even though it is not
3676844 even when we were two goals down i still thought that we had a real chance its a big positive for us to prove that we can fight back like that we knew we could get a result and that will fill us with confidence
3676845 they outplayed us in the first half but i thought our superior fitness would see us through in the end although it was a very tough battle
3676846 we just need to keep our foot on the accelerator now and try to cut out the basic mistakes weve drawn against the second best side in the world and really worn them down in the end weve got a day to recover and then we need to up our levels again
3676847 they were missing quite a few of their main players and the results of pre olympic friendlies can be pretty meaningless
3676848 matches with new zealand are usually decided by one goal and im sure its going to be another humdinger
3676849 we are a bit disappointed we didnt get the win
3676850 we pushed on in the second half and put huddersfield under a lot of pressure
3676851 were happy enough with one point but i think we could have got all three
3676852 they are a big physical side but the gaffer tried to counter that by bringing on matty mcneil to try and hold things up
3676853 we changed the shape in the second half and i think that worked
3676854 this result will give us all confidence now though we can push on from here and go and get that first win of the season soon thats most important
3676855 its a good start but maybe we should have won the game
3676856 we should have created more with all the possession we had in the second half but we cant grumble at coming here and getting a point
3676857 we like to play it from the back and move forward utilising the space
3676858 its a good start for us but it could have been even better
3676859 the atmosphere was brilliant this is what its all about playing in front of big crowds
3676860 it just makes you hungrier to go on and play at an even higher level
3676861 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3676862 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee
3676863 everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3676864 the thing i miss the most about not competing is the fight
3676865 ive gone through this experience before so i knew what i was in for i know im in no condition to beat anybody right now so i dont have a problem with not being able to compete
3676866 i will definitely watch some of the ryder cup matches and will be pulling hard for the american team
3676867 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3676868 i think were on home soil but i think the europeans are pretty strong right now stronger than i thought they were going to be
3676869 i still think the u s is going to win at valhalla
3676870 the men s 400m relay was insane we were down by almost a half body length going into the final turn and then next thing you knew it was closer closer closer until we touched the wall first cash and i went crazy
3676871 leadership and scale are vital to win especially in a market that is consolidating

3676887 the speed and severity of the dollars run higher has resulted in some long liquidation
3676888 at the moment it is hard to see an end to it but we still have some supportive factors such as inflation geopolitical tensions and falling mine supply
3676889 it looks like sentiment towards gold has turned negative were seeing long liquidation on the back of both dollar movement and the oil price movement

3676906 this is a good example of symantecs policy of taking robust action against people who deal in counterfeit software
3676907 i think we have been diabolically treated we feel totally ignored and brushed aside the only consultation has been a token effort and some of the furniture was already being moved before it was over a lot of people feel very strongly about this i have watched my children playing sport from that area as have many others it also makes for a fantastic place to meet and relax with a coffee or drink after sport we very much want it to stay
3676908 it is still only a proposal to replace the bar and viewing area with a childrens fitness and education theatre we have held three consultations on site with senior management which have been heated debates and extended the period three times
3676909 the only target ive set this season is for us to win the league title im not thinking about finishing comfortably half way up the table my policy is and always will be to go for the top spot
3676910 realistically reaching the play offs would be a bonus i suppose but thats the very least im after this season the lads are confident and theres a good buzz in the dressing room so im looking forward to the new season now
3676911 its true that the only way is up for us this season
3676912 but things have really come together during pre season i am still looking for a couple of further new additions but so far ive managed to bring some real quality into the club
3676913 the attitudes of all the players has been good theyre all enthusiastic and have worked hard in pre season
3676914 well be going for the three points on saturday and then on tuesday going for draws is just not an option
3676915 we will continue to do everything we can to support schools to ensure that these results continue to improve even further to have continued to show improvement and build on progress made in previous years is a tremendous effort and clearly shows that strategies put in place to improve performance in schools are working well i would like to congratulate all the staff governors parents and children at stockport primary schools for their fantastic achievements

3676917 we slept outside in the mountains and did biking running canoeing and canyoning it was very good for team spirit
3676918 it was tough physically and mentally and you had to help each other out
3676919 i joined in everything it would have been difficult to ask the players to do it if i hadnt but all the players were pleased to do it and proud about what they had achieved
3676920 it helped with team spirit and team bonding because if you are climbing 70 metres up and you get stuck you have to communicate and get help from your friend
3676921 that communication and team spirit is important in rugby when you have a difficult game or have to defend close to the line hopefully this experience will help
3676922 rory and eifion were the two best players on the pitch against perpignan
3676923 rory looks fitter and better than ever he hurt his shoulder a bit at the end of the game but he has been with the physio and will probably be fit to play next friday
3676924 eifion has lost more than two stone in weight he looks very fit and fast near the end of the game against perpignan he came back to tackle their wing and saved a try that would not have been possible last year
3676925 the game is going to be quicker and faster this season so players need to be slimmer quicker and run more than before
3676926 we had 18 senior players missing from the side a lot of them are still in fitness training so it has been good for younger players development

3677070 our long term plan will cut city governments annual output of greenhouse gases by nearly 1 7 million metric tons which also will greatly improve air quality and take a 220 megawatt bite out of peak demand for electricity
3677071 we can achieve these results by using cost effective existing technologies the city is doing its part i hope the private sector follows our example and finds conservation savings of their own
3677072 this plan is the most in depth and comprehensive ever look at the energy used by the city which is the largest property manager in the city as well as the operator of the largest municipal vehicle fleet in the nation
3677073 we have identified a number of ways to make real energy savings and the investments we make today will start paying for themselves immediately and be fully recouped in just a few years
3677074 todays announcement confirms that significant reductions in energy usage to achieve the 30 percent reduction requirement in global warming pollution by 2017 is not only achievable but it will also save taxpayers money
3677075 especially during this period of high energy costs deploying energy efficient lighting air conditioning motors and office equipment along with improved operations and maintenance makes economic sense and it is to the citys credit and mayor bloombergs leadership that existing public buildings will be showing the way the public is watching and counting on the city to now deliver on the promise
3677076 the new york power authority has a long history of working with the city of new york our largest electricity customer on projects to advance energy efficiency and clean new energy technologies at public facilities in the city

3677102 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3677103 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3677104 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3677105 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3677130 hqs sales rebounded in the second quarter of 2008 from our traditionally slow first quarter but while we did not directly suffer from the severe winter storms that hit mainland china beginning of 2008 we were subsequently impacted by dramatic cost increases due to decreased tilapia supplies and increased cost of feed fuel and labor although through the avoidance of long term fixed price contracts we are usually able to pass along price increases to our customers the rapid rate and scope of cost increases outpaced our price increases the situation has since stabilized and current prices reflect expected profitability
3677131 hqs sales were below our expectations as many buyers delayed or reduced purchases due to expected substantial price corrections at the end of the summer
3677132 however our direct sales increased markedly during the quarter the benefits of these sales is being felt now as costs stabilize and new higher margin products are introduced to more buyers directly in touch with new consumer preferences this relationship led to the declaration of our tilapia bill of rights which allowed our more direct buyers to address consumers food safety environmental and health concerns building further the relationship and the reliance on hqs quality health product sales were also affected by increased costs as some raw material costs experienced substantial increases a new price structure reflecting these increases and continuing historic profitability has been announced for september 1 of this year

3677223 as i approached the postroom i heard carole robinson saying hurry up golliwog she had her back to me and i said i heard that

3677231 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3677232 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3677233 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3677234 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3677235 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3677236 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3677244 absolutely nothing to do with the conduct of the elections
3677245 it is a total misconception and misrepresentation of the facts and it was very unfair to dr anthony who did an excellent job for the press to be treating him like this
3677246 last year when we launched the 8th edition of the clubs magazine our late assistant secretary ceo was here acting in the capacity of chairperson for the proceedings today he is no longer with us but his vision for the launching of another youth magazine and the formation of a female cricket team has been realized and we are proud to do this here today in his memory
3677247 we are pleased to be making this contribution towards the clubs drive to promote discipline and i would like to take this opportunity to urge the youths of not only the club but the community at large to be ambassadors of the organization they represent
3677248 rose hall town youth and sports club rhtysc give account for what they spend and as a corporate entity in guyana we have had a lot of problems with other clubs in the past with regards to accountability we have no problems giving sponsorship but as a company we do expect accountability and rhtysc is a club with an exceptional difference on this issue with such in mind we have no problem partnering with them and would like to urge other companies to come forward and offer their support towards the development of sports here in guyana
3677249 because gt amp t is a corporate citizen with an active conscience we have supported a number of initiatives in conjunction with the rhtysc a perusal of our catalogue of sponsorship will show we supported their anti drugs and pro education campaign the senior citizens launch on the clubs annual award ceremony their ms region 6 pageant their annual hiv aids programme and many more
3677250 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years

3677256 at issue here is not whether the law was allegedly broken but whether indeed there was an outright and unambiguous admission by dr ramsammy in the body of the story rather than an editorialized interpretation of guilt
3677257 if after a careful analysis kaieteur news agrees that it is wrong the only logical expectation will be that of an unqualified apology and retraction
3677258 given the fact that the gpas purpose is to essentially develop the profession of journalism and promote media freedoms we believe the time has come for the print and electronic media to consider the value of the establishment of a media com plaints committee mcc
3677259 an mcc can for instance address concern s by anyone about the use of names videos and photographs of minors allegedly involved or convicted of crimes or the deceptive use of breaking news in advertisements
3677260 at the end of the day we must be fair balanced objective and responsible if we are to be recognised by the public as credible media workers and media houses
3677261 its a major inconvenience for us particularly for those passengers coming in from miami that already have to wait a long time in piarco before they come across so i am hoping that something is done
3677262 when it is alleged that he managed to pick the handcuffs and open the prison van door and escaped in the vicinity of croal street
3677263 mr ramkarran made a mistake when he appeared in his speech to have opposed moses nagamootoo for condemning mugabe as a dictator and for choosing barack obama as us president mr ramkarrans timing was bad this was before voting and also nagamootoos contribution was warmly welcomed by the entire floor this faux pas by mr ramkarran may have caused him to lose votes but he definitely could not have placed 22 on the list for the central committee this could not have been it is just not possible when you look at the names that were chosen above mr ramkarran
3677264 every time this matter comes up there is a problem
3677265 nothing stopping individuals from contacting the secretariat and communicating an interest in coming for the event
3677266 you must put this school in the news so that somebody the prime minister could do something about it
3677267 myself and other guyanese artistes have not been invited to carifesta

3677277 it bothers me that somebody can vote no on a taxing item without even marking a ballot
3677278 i think this change gives more latitude to agencies that go out for bond measures
3677279 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3677280 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3677281 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3677282 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3677283 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3677284 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3677285 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3677286 i said hows that festival going because i really want to go again this year
3677287 and he said unless somebody steps up there probably wont be one
3677288 i had never been involved with any of that stuff so i asked well what do you mean
3677289 for new events we have the x treme dog jumping which is called the northwest challenge
3677290 thats where they run along the platform and jump as far and as high as they can into a swimming pool a 27 000 gallon swimming pool
3677291 its got a tower with music blaring and all of that so it should be pretty exciting well see how it goes
3677292 and if youve got kids weve got a jumpy castle
3677293 in my opinion and again just because im doing this doesnt mean im an expert on duck hunting but the idea of the festival to me was always centered around the duck and goose calling championships
3677294 thats kind of i still feel that way thats oregons effort to become national and be a recognized state in world class duck calling
3677295 we are the largest waterfowl festival on the west coast
3677296 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3677297 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3677298 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3677299 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3677300 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3677301 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3677302 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3677303 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3677304 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3677305 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3677306 mehr als eine empirische wirklichkeit interessiert mich eine poetische wahrheit
3677307 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3677308 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3677309 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3677310 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3677311 i dont suggest revealing dress is the only reason for rape
3677312 we thought it is better for shiv to stay in england and play for his county durham who is enjoying a good run in the english county championships at the moment and besides he is playing cricket and keeping himself active so there is no need for us to be concerned
3677313 dwayne bravo is nursing an ankle injury that requires surgery and would keep him out of action for a period of time whilst it was decided to walk with baugh on the tour to pakistan for the icc trophy tournament with two ideas in mind
3677314 whilst we all acknowledge that ramdin is the best wicketkeeper batsman in the region at the moment he is a little short on runs thus we decided to go with baugh barbados patrick browne was also considered for the tournament in pakistan but knowing his vulnerability to spin bowling and with the view of them encountering spinners in pakistan baugh was our first choice seeing also that he is coming off a successful season not only for jamaica but also in the warm up matches against the australians
3677315 theyre doing it out of a love of their community
3677316 you got to be a big burly guy to do the job
3677317 i always wanted to be a firefighter but i didnt want to give up my day job
3677318 if theres something going on i like to be a part of it
3677319 things did not go as well as they should have that should not be surprising its that complicated i think there were unrealistic cost expectations and too much focus on cost savings that were not achievable but it was not a failure
3677320 you should never invite an auditor to dinner because we have a tendency to criticize the cook
3677321 the ability to have consistent online service 24 hours a day seven days a week is new to many agencies
3677322 departments can focus on their core business the state is able to fully leverage its buying power to negotiate lower maintenance fees on software and hardware
3677323 it will give us a leg up to determine if were moving in the right direction
3677324 we need to look closer at these projects early on
3677325 i believe the state data center while it has not met early stated objectives as well as possible has given us a great opportunity to go forward
3677326 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race

3677340 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3677341 the stars in a way seem to be lining up for the cape as it relates to wastewater
3677342 in spite of these strict orders there were at least three other children in the cannon household
3677343 raped molested sexually and physically assaulted intimidated and otherwise abused dakota
3677344 terrible he had a lot of emotional issues before this because his mom was in prison for drug and alcohol related offenses and apparently there was sexual abuse early in his life he wasnt exactly in the best of shape emotionally before this and the events surrounding what happened have exacerbated it he has a hard time communicating verbally
3677345 prone to lashing out exposing himself and otherwise instigating instances in which he may create an environment that would invite sexual abuse and assault by other male children this was a primary reason why dakota was to be placed in a foster care environment without other children
3677346 that was the key element that was supposed to be met in addition to the treatment he needed in a temporary foster situation
3677347 unfortunately for whatever reason catholic community services or dhs or somebody dropped the ball and he was placed in a home with another foster child and the background he had was not suitable for that
3677348 i dont believe based on what i can tell that the cannons had a clue that that single child in the home was supposed to be the situation i think they still needed to maintain supervision and make sure the kid didnt get hurt and so forth those are different issues and responsibilities but in regards to the communication that was between the state and the agent they contracted with catholic community services
3677349 were unaware of such a case and in any event we are bound by customer confidentiality so we would be completely unavailable to comment

3677359 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3677360 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3677361 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3677362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3677363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3677364 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3677365 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3677366 scopul este acela de a face publicul sa inteleaga ca aici se petrece ceva este vorba despre secretele pe care majoritatea oamenilor le ignora
3677367 oamenii care vin sa viziteze los angeles nu vor sa mearga sa vada cele mai afectate zone
3677368 che sta facendo e far sicuramente rumore e romper il paludoso silenzio un misto tra ipocrisia conformismo disdegno assoluto della verit e scarso rispetto dei consumatori che regna ora a montalcino
3677369 ma in realt le cose vanno ben diversamente e temo che i produttori seri quelli al di sopra di ogni sospetto puliti al 100 siano una minoranza virtuosa attiva determinata tenace ma sempre minoranza
3677370 i first arrived in montalcino in 2004 to write a tuscan wine guide
3677371 all vineyard soils contain around 20 to 30 trace metals like selenium or molybdenum for example
3677372 the patterns change according to which region you are in first youd establish what the pattern of trace metals was in wines made only from grapes grown in montalcino then youd analyse wines from any regions outside montalcino which you think have been used as blending material wines labelled as brunello falling outside the statistical pattern of the soils from which they are supposed to have been grown on can thus be identified and matched to where they might really have been sourced from
3677373 if i was a wine producer i would confidently challenge its accuracy if asked to appear in court
3677374 its harder to check if different grapes from exactly the same site have been blended together
3677375 i blend in a bit of colorino from my uncle
3677376 i just dont want to know what goes on in there the winery
3677377 research by the school of psychology at the university of plymouth in 2003 demonstrated that goldfish have a memory span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes colors and sounds they were trained to push a lever to earn a food reward when the lever was fixed to work only for an hour a day the fish soon learned to activate it at the correct time the mythbusters tested the myth that goldfish only had a memory span of 3 seconds the mythbusters were also able to prove that goldfish had a longer memory span than commonly believed this was done by making goldfish go through a maze over a period of time it was evident that they were able to remember the way and that they therefore had a memory span of over three seconds
3677378 the bbc has always been a strong advocate and driver of open industry standards without these standards tv and radio broadcasting would simply not function
3677379 i believe that the time has come for the bbc to start adopting open standards such as h 264 and aac for our audio and video services on the web these technologies have matured enough to make them viable alternatives to other solutions
3677380 the advantage for the audience will be a noticeable improvement in audio and video quality furthermore it should become easier for the media to simply work across a broader range of devices
3677381 hal rooney deputy chief for santa clara county fire said the fire may have started under an air conditioning unit on the second floor
3677382 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3677383 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3677384 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3677385 in conclusion this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3677386 what happens in california will next happen in the rest of the country
3677387 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3677388 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3677389 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3677390 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3677391 we will fiercely protect the goodwill in the london dungeon brand particularly from such blatantly parasitic behaviour

3677482 the bottom 60 percent will get about 150 the top 0 1 percent thats approaching 3 million a year get almost 270 000 how do you sell that as a plan that targets sams club more than the country club

3677497 but securing the border could take years what if it never happens when will you get to comprehensive immigration reform

3677935 arroyos deception is further exposed by the fact that federalism cannot be achieved by the mere amendment of one or two provisions
3677936 congress as a constituent assembly assumes a different constitutional entity and function and cannot therefore be bound by a legislative act such as a joint resolution since it is empowered by the constitution to amend not a mere law but the constitution itself
3677937 it is therefore clear that arroyo is merely riding on the issues of federalism and peace in mindanao to push for charter change which is ultimately aimed at prolonging her stay in power and eliminating the protectionist economic provisions in the constitution in fact she can stay beyond 2010 via the surgical amendment of deleting the term limit on the presidency in article vii sec 4

3678292 we intend to use helicopter models as the platform for the new technology we need a vehicle that can carry cameras and various sensors as well as the control mechanisms a helicopter type unmanned vehicle would be able to hover and would be more stable than an aeroplane for specific operations

3678294 they would be controlled from a command base which could be a jeep roving about the area or possibly airborne but they would also be able to act autonomously for example if one uav detected a signal such as a heat source or a radio pulse from clothing or a mobile phone call it could leave the other vehicles to investigate and then return and relay its information back to base

3678325 we are trying to find the best 11 on defense and the best 11 on offense so if walker finds himself there he will absolutely start there is no preconceived notion on where guys will end up as we go through things

3678344 the one thing you wonder about is the durability hes got to understand that 20 plays into 2004 ricky santos had to take somebodys place thats why backup kevin deckers got to feel like hes the starter and theres going to be competition
3678345 me and r j played together freshman year so im used to him
3678346 hes a very good quarterback so its easy for the receivers to adjust and its easy for r j to adjust were a tight team
3678347 it has all the makings of a real good line

3678373 a surf contest does not necessarily warrant an expanded area
3678374 it doesnt affect them because they send the competitors out in heats of about six people at a time

3678401 many of the firefighters serve with no pay they need some kind of reward
3678402 it is important for us that we get together as a community to discuss ideas on how to weather the energy crisis
3678403 with the rising cost of energy affecting all of us we all need this open forum to learn how to be as energy efficient as possible

3678446 there is understandable concern that toll road privatization might lead to private companies acquiring the power to condemn land for right of way to the best of my knowledge none of the nearly two dozen state public private partnership enabling acts has delegated any such power to private partner companies the eminent domain power is always reserved by the state in its traditional role of acquiring rights of way for public use infrastructure

3678480 you see minor injuries and you kind of expect that but to see such a horrific injury theres no way id take my family back there
3678481 my 13 year old is upset about it he totally understood what was going on unlike my three year old
3678482 the drivers are the main ones because they are the ones who experience being in the pit
3678483 theyre the ones with the most expertise on what happens down there
3678484 it comes from each year of the drivers experience a lot of it might just be on their own some of them might want to take even more precautions than whats required and then word kind of gets around
3678485 its not in place that there has to be majority vote
3678486 its not as formal as that but we take every concern seriously and we do discuss it
3678487 it doesnt come down to a vote but naturally if youre getting a majority opinion on something you kind of get the idea that well go with that
3678488 with my car i always make sure i get it ready with the help of friends
3678489 i want everything to be safe for myself im the one in the car driving
3678490 i want to protect myself im sure other people must feel the same way they dont want anything to happen to themselves either it depends on experience too how many years theyve been driving sometimes you get the new drivers and they dont know
3678491 maybe its better not to have a survivor series or if were going to have a survivor series to look at it and maybe have each car inspected again and checked to see if its really safe
3678492 this is something that would make me think if it was able to go would i feel safe in going in with a car thats pretty smashed in
3678493 if cars are inspected at the beginning of the derby theyre considered safe to go in there
3678494 after that we have no idea if theyre doing any alterations to their vehicles that topic did come up that it would be a per heat inspection

3678502 we are really preparing for the inevitability of an economy in which is greenhouse gases are regulated and taxed
3678503 we tax people for putting garbage out at the sidewalk
3678504 why because theres a cost to picking it up you have to work to minimize the cost you can put smoke into the air for free so you got to put a price on carbon
3678505 airlines are looking very seriously at carbon reduction programs and the customers that we cater to are looking very seriously at it many of them are european and everybodys aware that the europeans are well ahead of the north americans with this type of initiative we need to demonstrate leadership and to do our part our customers want the confidence of doing business with a partner that shares their environmental values

3678532 i firmly believe robert gates the current secretary of defense and bush sr s right hand man in the covert world used computer cryptography and software security assets to get bush jr elected both times i do not have direct knowledge of the operation but research robert gates bill owens electronic voting security hava votehere and scientific applications international corp the operation went so well that gates was going to be made the first ever director of national intelligence he turned down the job but then took the secretary of defense position when rumsfeld was removed from his public position i dont think there will ever be solid evidence linking directly to members of the administration its all a tangled web of plausible deniability but i do think it will eventually be proven that the elections were manipulated to deliver bush the victory many people in the covert world take this for granted as common sense
3678533 in the seventeen years ive been an election administrator my experience is that the american electoral system is rotten and we need to deal with that we are hostage to the desires of private interests to conduct the most public of our procedures public elections you could steal the election and no one would ever know
3678534 the machines four sources of vote totals did not agree with one another the current election system appears to provide some of its promised benefits at potentially great cost namely that the election system in its entirety exhibits shortcomings with extremely serious consequences these shortcomings merit urgent attention relying on this system in its present state should be viewed as a heightened risk of unacceptable cost

3678568 es urgente que la uni n europea legisle para que todos los productos de origen forestal presentes en el mercado europeo provengan de fuentes legales y de un buena gesti n forestal

3678605 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3678606 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies

3678612 if youre going to try to help go get eznik dammit
3678613 go down the hall to the room next to the medical wing it will say eznik on it now go boy
3678614 well look what we got here a little nosey faerie why dont you go run after your boyfriend
3678615 if it wasnt for link i doubt you would have made it down the hall to get eznik
3678616 theres a man here and hes injured hes down the hall next to the room you let me rest in
3678617 by the sweet goddess what did you get yourself into this time
3678618 tell your little friends to go back to their room
3678619 damit eznik i dont want your new found friends gawking over me the last thing i need is for him and that nosey faerie to know what i look like
3678620 alright then tell me who did this to you describe the being that did this because if im right im afraid you may have some serious complications
3678621 it was some man dressed in blue medieval armor he had green eyes and brown hair tied back nothing that unusual that really stood out about him he somehow found me and challenged me to a sword fight theres your description happy so you can tell the boy to leave
3678622 youve been poisoned the blade that man uses is coated with a poison that im not even sure there is an antidote for at least im not sure what its cure is
3678623 wait a minute if youre suggesting this man was wounded by the same man that fought me then youve forgotten that i was in a different timeframe at the time so i dont think it could have been the same person
3678624 different timeframe that makes no difference to a warrior like that dimension travel is one of his specialties and as for the poison i see this young one came out of it ok so im sure ill do fine so doc fix my wound and boy why dont you and your little sweetheart go back to your room and give the wounded their peace
3678625 come on you get to help me carry him to the medical wing
3678626 alright now the blondie and his faerie are out of here
3678627 link theres some bandages there i need you to get them for me
3678628 by the sound of it this man doesnt want me or link in here
3678629 well i am the one treating the wound so what i say goes the extra help will make this go faster
3678630 im not doing it with these two here got it
3678631 either you take it off or i drug you and take it off myself but either way your armor is coming off besides i doubt those two even know what the dimensional government is by the looks of it they havent been through the merge no ones identity is going to be compromised here so just take it off
3678632 link whatever you do dont touch the blood on it it will be acidic to you
3678633 what do you mean acidic arent you going to get burned by the blood
3678634 her blood will harm you and link as for me ill be fine
3678635 im someone who wants you or your little boyfriend to leave the room to give the wounded their privacy but this ass is keeping you in here to piss me off
3678636 this is my sister autum im sorry she tends to be rather a bitch at times
3678637 why do you always bring strangers on your ship and then purposely do crap like this to piss me off
3678638 what about your sword how can you wield such a huge sword with only one hand
3678639 its enchanted thats all you better watch it your girlfriend is getting jealous
3678640 you stay here with autum trust me youll be fine youre way too young for her lad
3678641 ill talk to navi if autums condition changes at all please come and find me
3678642 my guess is youre not much of a lover boy
3678643 that faerie likes you more than you think thats what got her upset but by the looks of it you never noticed which means either youre too dense to see it or youre more of a fighter than you show my guess is the second because your eyes show you been through a lot of battles
3678644 how can you tell that when you havent even fought me
3678645 you cant read your opponent reading your opponent is an important part of fighting when you can it gives you the advantage reading people will give you a little insight of their style my guess is you wield a one handed sword possibly with a shield and that youre not around lot of women so fighting one would make you very nervous and off balance
3678646 i dont have feelings for link like that hes not my boyfriend she just does that to get his attention so hell like her more shes jealous because im with him yeah thats right
3678647 first off theres no need for you to get jealous over my sister your friend is way too young for her
3678648 but then why was link asking her things why was he so interested he usually barely speaks to strangers
3678649 theyre both fighters so they connect a lot easier another thing is they both realize they have a common enemy that will be one thing that will bring them closer just to find that enemys weak points second point link is about 16 or 17 is my guess and thats way too young for my sister i mean im 27 so that makes my sister even older you see no worries

3678696 no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier
3678697 how come modern sports especially womens sports involve the exposure of private parts it is well known that the olympics both in the past and the upcoming games the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
3678698 yes it is an enormous satanic issue many people nowadays watch sports rather than participate in them

3678712 por qu fue correcta la respuesta de rusia a georgia
3678713 el enfrentamiento con los catalanes hacen que peligren los presupuestos de 2009
3678714 en qu fuerza complementaria podr n apoyarse los socialistas espa oles a quienes les faltan siete esca os en el congreso de los diputados para alcanzar la mayor a absoluta a la hora de lograr la aprobaci n del presupuesto del a o 2009 la tarea de prev francamente dif cil ahora que el gobierno de madrid ha resultado incapaz de conseguir dentro de los plazos legales es decir antes del pasado s bado llegar a un acuerdo con las autoridades auton micas de catalu a sobre su nuevo modelo de financiaci n
3678715 en las actuales circunstancias el apoyo de los diez diputados de ciu formaci n que acusa a madrid de haber violado gravemente sus compromisos parece estar descartado y lo que es a n m s grave el de los 25 diputados de la secci n catalana del partido socialista el psc parece ser tambi n incierto el psc dispone de una baza en gran medida fue gracias a la fuerte ventaja registrada en catalu a como jos luis rodr guez zapatero consigui las legislativas del pasado mes de marzo pero en estos tiempos de crisis galopante el margen de maniobra del ministro de econom a pedro solbes para satisfacer las reivindicaciones catalanas es especialmente estrecho
3678716 si la situaci n no se desbloquea antes de la votaci n del presupuesto en el mes de octubre ser obligatorio prorrogar para el a o que viene el presupuesto de 2008 pero de un a o a otro el ciclo econ mico ha cambiado completamente y las perspectivas optimistas de crecimiento que presidieron la elaboraci n de las cuentas p blicas actuales sin duda alguna ahora est n fuera de lugar
3678717 las reivindicaciones de catalu a complican la reanudaci n de las tareas pol ticas de zapatero
3678718 la iniciaci n del curso pol tico en t rminos econ micos ser compleja para jos luis rodr guez zapatero la crisis inmobiliaria y financiera ya tiene repercusiones en la vuelta a las actividades pol ticas y las preocupaciones del gobierno socialista no proceder n necesariamente de la oposici n de derechas el presidente del gobierno tiene muchos problemas este verano con sus aliados del partido socialista catal n que dirigen la regi n de catalu a junto con los verdes y los independentistas de esquerra republicana los socialistas catalanes amenazan con no votar a favor de los presupuestos del estado si no obtienen concesiones en la financiaci n de su autonom a y teniendo veinticinco diputados son un peso pesado en el congreso de diputados de madrid
3678719 de confirmarse esta amenaza ser a una de las m s inc modas para jos luis rodr guez zapatero el punto de discordia reside en la financiaci n del estatuto de catalu a en vigor desde el 9 de agosto de 2006 que rechazado por la oposici n de derechas pero apoyado activamente por zapatero aumenta las competencias y la autonom a de la regi n la tarea del gobierno de jos luis rodr guez zapatero es tanto m s delicada en cuanto que se encuentra en medio de negociaciones del modelo fiscal con el conjunto de las autonom as espa olas que en su totalidad no quieren verse perjudicadas
3678720 espa a estudia nuevas medidas para relanzar la econom a en crisis
3678721 el gobierno espa ol est estudiando medidas adicionales para combatir el freno de la econom a en un consejo de ministros extraordinario que transcurrir ma ana se har un an lisis de la situaci n econ mica del pa s ya con los datos definitivos de la inflaci n en julio que ronda los 5 3 y los n meros preliminares del pib del segundo trimestre para garantizar que por lo menos los gastos de los consumidores continuar n siendo un motor de crecimiento para espa a el ministro de econom a pedro solbes ya anunci que los funcionarios p blicos tendr n un aumento superior al 3 en 2009 por encima de los 3 1 que los analistas esperan para la inflaci n de esta forma el gobierno quiere asegurar que los funcionarios p blicos ganan poder de compra
3678722 irlanda y espa a dos visiones distintas de la crisis inmobiliaria
3678723 espa a e irlanda son dos pa ses que en otros tiempos fueron faros de la econom a europea pero la crisis inmobiliaria les pas factura las dos econom as hacen ahora balance y los resultados son diferentes sin embargo todo parec a unir a espa a e irlanda los precios de las viviendas se triplicaron y cuadruplicado respectivamente en diez a os el sector inmobiliario y las constructoras propiciaron por s solas el 60 de los cr ditos facilitados por los bancos la construcci n gener el 18 del crecimiento de las dos econom as
3678724 no obstante espa a podr a tardar m s tiempo que irlanda en terminar de pagar los platos rotos los analistas consideran que espa a podr a necesitar 4 a os para deshacerse de las 1 5 millones de viviendas nuevas que permanecen sin vender esta cifra supera con creces las 50 000 unidades registradas en irlanda esta ltima utiliz los a os de euforia inmobiliaria para desarrollar sectores como el farmac utico e inform tico mientras que espa a sigui invirtiendo en el inmobiliario y la construcci n entretanto las exportaciones espa olas se resienten por falta de competitividad y su productividad se sit a entre las m s bajas de la zona euro
3678725 anta o los dos pa ses podr an haber recurrido a una devaluaci n de sus monedas o a una baja de los tipos de inter s pero ahora han dejado de manejar esas herramientas los bancos podr an ser los primeros en sufrir las consecuencias del contexto actual en este caso toda apunta a que los bancos irlandeses podr an recuperarse antes que los espa oles

3678728 hubo adem s razones de estado no s lo fue para velar por el xito de las celebraciones independentistas sino porque est n en juego los intereses econ micos y los negocios de espa a y de sus empresas en cuya defensa es notoria la activa intervenci n del gobierno y del rey por otro lado en poca de crisis aunque rodr guez zapatero lo ignore no est mal un poco de petr leo barato a cambio de asistencia y asesor as a fidel le ha ido b rbaro

3678731 el presidente de georgia confiaba en el apoyo incondicional de occidente y ste le dio pie para pensar as es importante se alar que durante todos estos a os la posici n de rusia defend a la integridad territorial de georgia pero s lo era posible resolver este problema por la v a pac fica lo ocurrido en la noche del 7 al 8 de agosto en tsijinvali no es de raz n rusia no pod a dejar de reaccionar culpar a rusia de agredir a la peque a e indefensa georgia es sencillamente hip crita e inhumano en su tiempo yo habl de que la resoluci n de los problemas en osetia del sur y abjasia era posible con la creaci n en georgia de una federaci n con amplia autonom a para estas rep blicas es un error que ee uu considere al c ucaso zona de sus intereses nacionales los juegos geopol ticos no s lo en el c ucaso son peligrosos y esa es otra lecci n que debemos aprender de los ltimos acontecimientos
3678732 lleg a mosc cuando la guerra hab a acabado el presidente de francia intenta reconciliar a rusia con georgia
3678733 estamos dispuestos a hablar de la regulaci n pac fica en osetia del sur si se garantizan dos condiciones la firma en tbilisi de un acuerdo de no aplicaci n de fuerza y la salida del ej rcito georgiano de la regi n coment dmitri medvedev a nicol s sarkozy quien lleg a mosc con su propio plan de regularizaci n pac fica medvedev declar en osetia del sur se ha alcanzado el principal objetivo los soldados de paz y los ciudadanos han sido defendidos es una buena noticia trabajemos ahora sobre un documento para la regulaci n contest sarkozy el plan sarkozy prev el cese del fuego y la salida de todas las tropas georgianas y rusas de osetia del sur
3678734 mosc ha demostrado que est lista para responder a la presi n exterior
3678735 la guerra georgiano osetia ha acabado al menos el presidente dmitri medvedev anunci la conclusi n de las operaciones para imponer a georgia la paz desde las zonas del conflicto llegaban ayer noticias de que la resistencia militar a n contin a pero no reviste gran envergadura dmitri medvedev se entrevist con el mediador internacional el presidente de francia nicol s sarkozy el conflicto ha elevado de facto a rusia a un nuevo nivel que entra a muchos m s esfuerzos diplom ticos y pol ticos para afinar relaciones con la ue ee uu antiguas rep blicas sovi ticas y sat lites los cuales han resultado los principales enemigos de rusia en esta situaci n
3678736 el presidente de rusia dmitri medvedev el agresor ha sido castigado y ha sufrido grandes p rdidas
3678737 el kremlin propone a tbilisi la paz pero no la amistad este es el balance que arroj el d a de ayer y que posiblemente resultar en un punto de inflexi n para osetia del sur y abjasia por la ma ana el presidente dmitri medvedev anunci que la operaci n para imponer la paz hab a concluido es decir la guerra ha terminado por la tarde ya junto con el presidente de francia nicol s sarkozy quien ha asumido las funciones de mediador anunci seis principios sin los cuales no ser posible regular el conflicto el asunto depende ahora de tbilisi resumi medvedev
3678738 georgia se sale de la comunidad de estados independientes y exhorta a todos a seguirla menos a rusia
3678739 el fin de la guerra en osetia del sur anunciado ayer por el presidente de rusia ha coincidido con otro final en la cei mijail saakashvili ha anunciado a sus ciudadanos que georgia se sale de la cei seg n saakashvili georgia se despide as definitivamente de la uni n sovi tica el presidente georgiano ha exhortado a ucrania y otras ex rep blicas sovi ticas a unirse a la decisi n de georgia
3678740 por qu fue correcta la respuesta de rusia a georgia
3678741 para quienes estos ltimos d as hayan seguido el conflicto del c ucaso el relato est claro la valiente rep blica de georgia con s lo unos pocos millones de habitantes ha sido atacada por rusia su gigante vecino del este si sumamos a esto todos los estereotipos de la guerra fr a nos encontraremos ante la aut ntica interpretaci n de david y goliat con todas sus connotaciones del bien y del mal mientras que en occidente muchos medios de comunicaci n est n difundiendo esta versi n los hechos muestran un panorama bien diferente
3678742 el viernes pasado despu s de que los l deres mundiales llegasen a los juegos ol mpicos las tropas georgianas lanzaron un asalto a la regi n de osetia del sur que ha disfrutado de una independencia de facto desde hace m s de 16 a os nadie puede sorprenderse por tanto de que rusia respondiera a este asalto injustificado lanzando una incursi n militar en osetia del sur ning n pa s del mundo se quedar a de brazos cruzados mientras asesinan y echan de sus hogares a sus ciudadanos la respuesta de rusia ha sido completamente proporcional al ataque de georgia contra los ciudadanos rusos y sus tropas de mantenimiento de la paz el presidente georgiano mikheil saakashvili ha afirmado que salvo que el mundo entero la detenga rusia podr a enviar sus tanques a cualquier capital europea ma ana mismo est claro que georgia quiere que esta disputa se convierta en algo m s que en un corto y sangriento conflicto en la regi n
3678743 la uni n europea y estados unidos han de emplear toda su limitada influencia
3678744 rusia por el momento ha detenido m s o menos su asalto contra georgia la diplomacia encabezada por nicolas sarkozy presidente franc s y en estos momentos tambi n de la ue ha saltado al terreno para tratar de separar y reconciliar a los combatientes pero vladimir putin que resurgi como el verdadero l der ruso la semana pasada ha alcanzado casi todos los objetivos rusos de guerra ante la d bil respuesta occidental rusia parece no tener nimos de negociar nada va ser una complicada gesti n de la crisis
3678745 la ue y ee uu tienen una limitada influencia sobre rusia y dado el err tico liderazgo de georgia el iou sobre su ingreso en la otan no la han aumentado ahora bien occidente debe relacionarse con mosc y comprobar a fondo cu les son sus intenciones hay que condicionar la pertenencia de rusia al g 8 su deseo de una asociaci n estrat gica con la otan y la ue y su entrada en la organizaci n mundial del comercio todo ello parte de su imagen como potencia mundial a que se comporte como una potencia responsable eso es lo m nimo que los nerviosos antiguos vasallos de la uni n sovi tica pueden esperar
3678746 los l deres del ca caso deben dejar de enfrentarse y desarrollar las bases de una paz duradera
3678747 la paz en el c ucaso interesa a todo el mundo pero es de sentido com n reconocer que rusia est all compartiendo una geograf a com n y siglos de historia rusia no est buscando la expansi n territorial sino sus intereses leg timos en la regi n la intenci n de la comunidad internacional a largo plazo podr a ser crear un sistema sub regional de seguridad y cooperaci n que har a imposible cualquier tipo de provocaci n construir este tipo de sistema ser a un reto que s lo se podr a conseguir con la cooperaci n de los pa ses de la regi n
3678748 lo m s dif cil es la respuesta a la pregunta sobre el futuro de georgia tanto militar como pol tico para el n cleo georgiano a n es relativamente f cil rusia tiene que abandonarlo pero el plan de paz presentado por el presidente franc s sarkozy en el kremlin tambi n prev la retirada de los militares rusos y georgianos en osetia del sur y abjasia a sus posiciones previas a la guerra sobre todo rusia no retirar a sus militares ni de abjasia ni de osetia del sur mosc se encuentra ante decisiones dif ciles debe anexionar las regiones e irritar a n m s a occidente o debe reconocer la independencia de los estados peque os y alentar as a los separatistas en su propio imperio
3678749 cuando comiencen las negociaciones habr que trazar una l nea roja rusia tiene que retirar a sus tropas de los territorios separatistas y no tiene derecho a exigir la dimisi n de saakaschwili un presidente democr ticamente electo pero tambi n tiene que estar claro que georgia sigue teniendo una perspectiva de adherirse a la otan en resumen tiene que quedar claro que georgia es ahora m s peque a pero que sigue disfrutando de todos los derechos de un estado independiente por extra o que suene la p rdida definitiva de abjasia y osetia del sur podr a terminar siendo una ventaja para georgia en los ltimos a os estas dos regiones han sido ante todo una pesada carga para el pa s
3678750 el viaje del presidente sarkozy entre mosc y tbilissi es un ejercicio de alto riesgo la debilidad del presidente bush en triste final de mandato coloca a la uni n europea en primera l nea para que la diplomacia gane a las armas en georgia una gran responsabilidad que constituye un doble desaf o para europa el del futuro de sus relaciones con rusia y el de su credibilidad en la escena internacional los veintisiete disponen de verdaderas ventajas para hacerse o r por los maestros del kremlin queda por saber si los europeos sabr n utilizar estas ventajas lo que implica hablar con una sola voz ser dif cil
3678751 tras cinco d as de combate cien mil desplazados y centenas de muertos mosc y tbilisi comunicaron ayer que aceptan el plan de paz propuesto por nicolas sarkozy en nombre de la ue para poner un punto final a las hostilidades entre las fuerzas rusas y las georgianas no obstante estados unidos y la otan permanecen esc pticos al inicio del d a el jefe de estado ruso dmitri medvedev comunic el fin de las operaciones militares en georgia y acept el plan de sarkozy que podr a servir de base para una resoluci n del consejo de seguridad de la onu
3678752 rusia propuso ayer al presidente franc s nicol s sarkozy un acuerdo de alto el fuego con condiciones para georgia horas despu s de anunciar el fin de las hostilidades mosc quiere que georgia retire sus tropas a las posiciones anteriores al ataque a osetia del sur y que prometa no volver a usar la fuerza dice la agencia reuters las fuerzas rusas de mantenimiento de la paz podr n tomar medidas adicionales de seguridad seg n la propuesta rusa el acuerdo prev adem s el inicio de las discusiones internacionales sobre el fututo de osetia del sur y de abjasia
3678753 si estados unidos y europa han hecho sonar notas diferentes respecto al conflicto entre rusia y georgia una divisi n igual de sorprendente ha surgido entre algunos l deres de europa occidental y oriental sobre las causas y consecuencias de la violencia francia que ocupa la presidencia de la ue y alemania que tiene v nculos estrechos tanto con rusia como con georgia son los que lideran el esfuerzo diplom tico
3678754 la historia hablar de los responsables de la acci n emprendida el pasado 8 de agosto por georgia en osetia del sur mientras tanto el mundo asiste a un enfrentamiento indirecto pero muy real entre rusia y los ee uu en todo caso washington se arriesga a aparecer como el gran perdedor de una partida aparentemente mal gestionada ya se encargar el futuro presidente de ee uu de reparar los da os y de restaurar la confianza entre los dos campos por otro lado rusia ha demostrado tres cosas se ha mostrado capaz de llevar a cabo con xito una operaci n militar de lo que dud bamos ha derrotado a un ej rcito instruido por ee uu y ha demostrado que ee uu y la otan no estaban a la altura de intervenir militarmente en la regi n mosc despu s de haber marcado ante todo el mundo los l mites que no hay que sobrepasar retoma su posici n en primera fila en la escena internacional no ser necesariamente un drama el mundo necesita equilibrio
3678755 georgia acepta la propuesta de alto el fuego mediada por sarkozy
3678756 los presidente de francia nicolas sarkozy y georgia mikhail saakashvili anunciaron en la madrugada de hoy en tbilisi que hab an llegado a un acuerdo para poner fin al conflicto entre rusia y georgia el acuerdo consiste en una versi n modificada de un plan negociado por sarkozy con el presidente de russia dmitri medvedev en una reuni n celebrada horas antes en mosc por exigencia de saakashvili medvedev tuvo que aprobar el texto final que incluye la supresi n de un punto que trataba las negociaciones sobre el futuro estatus de la provincia separatista georgiana de osetia del sur
3678757 medvedev y sarkozy acordaron seis principios para terminar conflicto en osetia del sur
3678758 el presidente ruso dmitry medvedev y el de francia nicolas sarkozy acordaron este martes seis principios para terminar con la hostilidades en la regi n separatista georgiana de osetia del sur de los seis principios el primero es no recurrir al uso de la fuerza el segundo es detener todas las acciones militares el tercero es el libre acceso de la ayuda humanitaria y el cuarto es que las fuerzas armadas de georgia regresen a sus bases el ej rcito ruso tambi n debe replegarse a sus posiciones previas al combate e iniciar las discusiones internacionales sobre el estado futuro de osetia del sur y abjasia y la forma de garantizar su seguridad
3678759 en el actual clima econ mico de morosidad aunque el gobierno asegure que ya se alcanzado el nivel r cord de inflaci n los resultados y los beneficios de los seis ltimos meses anunciados por los grupos franceses desde hace algunas semanas pueden ser tranquilizadores incluso en sectores fragilizados como el inmobiliario la espectacular ca da del euro frente al d lar alimentada por las malas cifras sobre la salud de la zona y por la decisi n del banco central europeo de mantener el status quo sobre los tipos de inter s suavizar la opresi n que pesaba sobre los exportadores y las firmas fuertemente internacionalizadas
3678760 el gobierno debe mantener su estructura monetaria cueste lo que cueste
3678761 debido a la subida del precio de los y el combustible la tasa anual de la inflaci n de precios al consumo subi un 4 en julio la inflaci n es ahora dos veces m s alta que la anunciada por el gobierno de un 2 el banco de inglaterra tiene la responsabilidad de conseguir ese objetivo sin embargo hay pocas perspectivas de una reducci n de los tipos de inter s a corto plazo a pesar de la desaceleraci n de la econom a y el colapso inmobiliario en estas circunstancias hay urgentes llamadas a cambiar la estructura de la pol tica monetaria acceder a hacerlo ser a un grave error el nivel de vida puede verse afectado
3678762 ante el peligro de que se impongan las posturas m s intransigentes
3678763 los resultados del refer ndum revocatorio no han sorprendido en verdad a nadie lo obvio es que fueron ratificados el presidente y los cuatro prefectos que lideran la oposici n afincada en la llamada media luna los estados m s ricos del oriente boliviano ambas partes no s lo ganaron en sus bastiones sino que se fortalecieron al haber obtenido m s votos de los que ya contaban de modo que no parece sa la perspectiva que hay que iluminar ahora sino esta otra m s puntual qu uso dar n o deber an dar estos protagonistas a sus respectivas victorias es inevitable que los prefectos insistan con instaurar la autonom a plena que les garantiza el manejo impositivo la legislaci n sobre tierras la administraci n de la seguridad el uso de los recursos naturales que consideran propios aunque esa pretensi n es ilegal lo indisputable es que la respaldaron con un promedio del 70 de los votos

3678862 doy gracias al se or por su vida ya que a travez de su estudio se reaviva un poco mas mi fe en la biblia tengo una pregunta referente al antiguo testamento por que el antiguo testamento es tan sangriento lleno de masacres de beb s mujeres ni os y ancianos llevadas a cabo por israel en nombre de dios no es esto una antimoral a todos los valores cristianos usted lo har a si dios se lo pidiese matar a bebes con un cuchillo creo en jesucristo creo en dios y creo en el esp ritu santo asisto a la iglesia todos los domingos y oro continuamente pero no quiero creer en un dios lleno de sed de sangre como el dios del antiguo testamento he orado pero no encuentro paz interior en este asunto dios le bendiga por su ayuda
3678863 entonces jehov dijo a abram ten por cierto que tu descendencia morar en tierra ajena y ser esclava all y ser oprimida cuatrocientos a os mas tambi n a la naci n a la cual servir n juzgar yo y despu s de esto saldr n con gran riqueza y t vendr s a tus padres en paz y ser s sepultado en buena vejez y en la cuarta generaci n volver n ac porque a n no ha llegado a su colmo la maldad del amorreo hasta aqu
3678864 entonces los hijos de israel entraron por en medio del mar en seco teniendo las aguas como muro a su derecha y a su izquierda y sigui ndolos los egipcios entraron tras ellos hasta la mitad del mar toda la caballer a de fara n sus carros y su gente de a caballo aconteci a la vigilia de la ma ana que jehov mir el campamento de los egipcios desde la columna de fuego y nube y trastorn el campamento de los egipcios y quit las ruedas de sus carros y los trastorn gravemente entonces los egipcios dijeron huyamos de delante de israel porque jehov pelea por ellos contra los egipcios y jehov dijo a mois s extiende tu mano sobre el mar para que las aguas vuelvan sobre los egipcios sobre sus carros y sobre su caballer a entonces mois s extendi su mano sobre el mar y cuando amanec a el mar se volvi en toda su fuerza y los egipcios al huir se encontraban con el mar y jehov derrib a los egipcios en medio del mar y volvieron las aguas y cubrieron los carros y la caballer a y todo el ej rcito de fara n que hab a entrado tras ellos en el mar no qued de ellos ni uno y los hijos de israel fueron por en medio del mar en seco teniendo las aguas por muro a su derecha y a su izquierda as salv jehov aquel d a a israel de mano de los egipcios e israel vio a los egipcios muertos a la orilla del mar y vio israel aquel grande hecho que jehov ejecut contra los egipcios y el pueblo temi a jehov y creyeron a jehov y a mois s su siervo

3678867 porque la ira de dios se revela desde el cielo contra toda impiedad e injusticia de los hombres que detienen con injusticia la verdad porque lo que de dios se conoce les es manifiesto pues dios se lo manifest porque las cosas invisibles de l su eterno poder y deidad se hacen claramente visibles desde la creaci n del mundo siendo entendidas por medio de las cosas hechas de modo que no tienen excusa pues habiendo conocido a dios no le glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias sino que se envanecieron en sus razonamientos y su necio coraz n fue entenebrecido profesando ser sabios se hicieron necios y cambiaron la gloria del dios incorruptible en semejanza de imagen de hombre corruptible de aves de cuadr pedos y de reptiles por lo cual tambi n dios los entreg a la inmundicia en las concupiscencias de sus corazones de modo que deshonraron entre s sus propios cuerpos ya que cambiaron la verdad de dios por la mentira honrando y dando culto a las criaturas antes que al creador el cual es bendito por los siglos am n

3678872 y vi a la bestia a los reyes de la tierra y a sus ej rcitos reunidos para guerrear contra el que montaba el caballo y contra su ej rcito y la bestia fue apresada y con ella el falso profeta que hab a hecho delante de ella las se ales con las cuales hab a enga ado a los que recibieron la marca de la bestia y hab an adorado su imagen estos dos fueron lanzados vivos dentro de un lago de fuego que arde con azufre y los dem s fueron muertos con la espada que sal a de la boca del que montaba el caballo y todas las aves se saciaron de las carnes de ellos

3678881 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3678882 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3678883 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3678884 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3678885 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3678886 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3678887 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3678888 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3678889 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3678890 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3678891 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3678892 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3678931 john joes timing is excellent normally but today wasnt what it should be but hes in the tournament now and his next opponent is a world silver medalist so hes back to a situation where hes a nobody going in and he performs well in that environment
3678932 even the chinese were on our side when they saw the number eight on the hood i was kind of concerned when i got docked the points i knew i had to get them back and it was a bit of a relief when he got deducted two as well so quickly
3678933 a year ago my main concern was a senior title now im here at the olympics its unbelievable
3678934 it wasnt the most fantastic of performances but the last time they fought was very similar there was a bit of needle between both of them and you could see that so were happy with the result not that happy with the performance but hes overturned a previous decision just like john joe joyce did that has to be good
3678935 the first time you are late making a payment of vat it is possible that no surcharge penalty will be payable but after that any further late payments will trigger surcharges rising from 2 to 15 of the vat outstanding
3678936 the key is to let h m revenue amp customs know what your situation is you mustnt bury your head in the sand waiting for the bailiffs also you could consider one of the special schemes offered like cash accounting or the flat rate scheme all businesses are different a little research into the options available to you may go a long way to help you ride out the current cash crunch

3678968 it does not provide a lower cost of fuel but it does provide useful information to consumers as to what the price of fuel is in different locations on the following day
3678969 thinking about how we listen to music today i wondered why it is that ringtones have so far been treated as unfit for creative music who says ringtones have to be bad its like saying lps or cds are bad its just a medium
3678970 because the piece is a collection of tones where i have no control of the order i made a structure that holds together by use of shared material like a cloud of pieces or a handful of confetti or a constellation of fragments to be navigated as you like
3678971 sp testens bis zum 15 november 2008 in vollem umfang zur verf gung stehen
3678972 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes
3678973 we hope things will not develop for the worse and that the language of reason and dialogue between all parties prevails
3678974 i think what makes it special is hes so good in this environment
3678975 we just basically give him a little training and try to just keep him happy
3678976 but it could have an effect later in the week
3678977 thats my job im trying to think about my plan and are we on it
3678978 i think one of the reasons ive been able to be like this is because ive been there before
3678979 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3678980 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3678981 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3678982 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3678983 when all is said and done we wouldnt be surprised to see very little global oil demand growth over this year and next
3678984 even if retail prices ease it seems unlikely that motorists who have purchased smaller cars will revert to gas guzzling vehicles
3678985 nevertheless the transition to a more fuel efficient u s fleet will take some time
3678986 in a couple of years time when things settle down well point back and say that was the peak and well all be trying to analyze when we get back to that peak again which i think we will
3678987 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3678988 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3678989 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3678990 for us a few too many mistakes on the synchronized part
3678991 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys at least mistakes like we did
3678992 the irvine public schools foundation ipsf is the difference between a first class and a world class education for the students of the irvine unified school district improved health services health education fine arts and science after school and summer enrichment classes and innovative teaching support in our middle and high schools are just some of the activities funded and managed by ipsf for the benefit of all our students
3678993 when the state originally decided on funding formulas for schools many years ago things were divided up between urban and rural areas
3678994 the irvine ranch was a lot of land it was considered rural so the schools get less funding per student than urban schools
3678995 the problem is politically if we change ours one of the urban districts is going to lose something so they fight it so well raise our own then
3678996 it has to be youll find one now at every public university at community colleges the public schools arent any different the state provides the basics but if you want excellence you have to do it yourself
3678997 now four house raffles 41 000 tickets and more than 8 4 million later loucindas big idea and dedicated work which amounts to nearly a full time job has proven a huge success for her community

3678999 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3679000 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3679001 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3679002 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3679003 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3679004 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3679005 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3679006 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3679007 the catalytic cracking unit is our main gas producing engine at the refinery
3679008 its your finishing unit its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer youre just not able to finish off the product and get it to market
3679009 why did these ninety four house members have a change of heart
3679010 look on my works ye mighty and despair i am the manifestation of all things technological within these walls and well beyond my peerless powers of it and development make lesser man and women tremble in awe not only do i know exactly how many bytes can dance on the head of a pin it is i that make them dance and when the time of ultimate pownage is upon my projects they look up in submission and know their lord and master
3679011 starbucks has really created a coffee culture raising awareness of good coffee which is good for independents
3679012 but on the other hand theyre on practically every corner and that makes it tough on the little guy too
3679013 when a starbucks closes it makes room for a local business to start
3679014 there are a lot of people out there who take delight in seeing an icon torn down by the masses
3679015 starbucks was a cool brand and then all of a sudden its not a cool brand
3679016 theres this new global consciousness that is out there that can suddenly shift
3679017 theyve commoditized cafe culture which is why i dont go
3679018 youve built your franchise on people who are coming in because they know exactly what they want
3679019 the people that work there are very pleasant but the stores are devoid of any kind of real charm or personality
3679020 they push a button and a machine does everything from grinding the beans to brewing the drink
3679021 the letter confirmed that an investigation into the complaints had been completed the results would be reviewed and recommendations formulated
3679022 management was copied on this letter to further demonstrate the seriousness with which the complaints were being treated

3679032 but he cant save himself hes the king of israel let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him
3679033 son why have you treated us like this your father and i have been anxiously searching for you
3679034 didnt you know i had to be in my fathers house
3679035 are you still sleeping and resting look the hour is near and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners 46 rise let us go here comes my betrayer
3679036 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3679037 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3679038 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3679039 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3679040 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3679041 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3679042 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3679043 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
3679044 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
3679045 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3679046 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3679047 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3679048 im a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
3679049 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3679050 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3679051 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3679052 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3679053 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3679054 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3679055 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3679056 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3679057 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3679058 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3679059 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3679060 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3679061 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3679062 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3679063 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3679064 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3679065 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3679066 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3679067 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3679068 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3679069 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3679070 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3679071 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3679072 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3679073 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3679074 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
3679075 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
3679076 we have now been able to protect the beach so we dont see that happen
3679077 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3679078 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3679079 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3679080 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3679081 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3679082 but in this case these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry
3679083 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3679084 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3679085 he are you aware that people think that you are younger than 16 and what do you say about that
3679086 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age
3679087 deng i would also like to know what chinese zodiac animal you are
3679088 he can you tell us a memory from your 15th birthday please how did you spend your 15th birthday did you spend it at home did you spend it with gymnasts can you tell us about that special day
3679089 i was with my team it was an ordinary day i didnt go home usually we dont go home when its our birthday we just celebrate with our team mates
3679090 you may check with the ioc international olympics committee and the fig all our registrations are done with legal evidence you may also search on the internet or even check with china public security ministry
3679091 in the past our chinese gymnasts usually practised too much but competed too little to do well at the major international tournaments
3679092 even a mule wont bump his head again in the same place
3679093 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
3679094 i was wondering how people on this forum built their net worth
3679095 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3679096 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3679097 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3679098 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3679099 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3679100 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3679101 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3679102 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3679103 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3679104 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3679105 we are honored to be a part of the kathy ireland home team with this partnership we celebrate the opportunity to maintain and support kathys mission of finding solutions for families especially busy moms we look forward to supporting the life of busy moms by bringing a blend of kathys classic traditional as well as contemporary designs that will appeal to any lifestyle to market

3679116 if the u s government is given unchecked surveillance power to monitor reporters confidential sources my ability to do this work will be seriously compromised
3679117 there is a lot of monitoring that goes on especially when you are overseas
3679118 but this creates a further erosion in my ability to work as a journalist
3679119 we are also preparing a new case against the government for its warrantless wiretapping past present and future
3679120 but suffice to say it will be quite different from the other cases against the government that have been filed so far
3679121 like with our case against at amp t however the ultimate goal will be the same to halt the mass interception of americans communications and to dismantle the dragnet spying network that was first exposed by our witness at amp t whistleblower mark klein
3679122 maar als je hier aan de start staat hoef je niet meer terug te kijken op hoe je voorbereiding was dat draai je toch niet meer terug
3679123 geen olympisch diploma ik lijst mijn rugnummer dan maar in
3679124 a few short months ago barack obama outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for american telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program
3679125 today the u s senate will approve legislation providing the immunity barack obama supposedly opposed and despite his promise he will not support a filibuster what barack obama will do is show that hes willing to change positions break campaign commitments and undermine his own words in his quest for higher office
3679126 it could not be clearer that this program broke the law and this president broke the law not only that but this administration affirmatively misled congress and the american people about it for years before it finally became public

3679129 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3679130 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3679131 we will conduct investigations and make sure justice is implemented
3679132 i sat in their room the other night and just watched them
3679133 their cribs are close together and they held each others hands as they fell asleep
3679134 it was so neat to see them comfort one another
3679135 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3679136 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3679137 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3679138 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out
3679139 they couldnt figure out how to blow out the candles so their cousins helped them
3679140 by the time they were done there was more cake in their hair and on their faces than in their mouths
3679141 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3679142 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3679143 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3679144 habl por tel fono con josemir y con su representante y me dijeron que estaba todo bien que llega ma ana por hoy es m s ya est el pasaje de avi n a su nombre es un jugador que f sicamente no tiene problemas hablar con l veremos c mo est y si hace falta figurar entre los 18 elegidos para el partido del domingo contra almagro

3679146 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3679147 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3679148 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3679149 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3679150 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3679151 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3679152 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3679153 rules are meant to be kept they are for our own good to keep us from getting into trouble
3679154 no hay nadie que diga que act a por razones espurias o que cobra o recibe dinero
3679155 un nivel de desconfianza que no corresponde a un ndice de este tipo
3679156 est asombrada por la falta de seriedad en el manejo de las estad sticas
3679157 le quita seriedad a un gobierno que est haciendo las cosas bien
3679158 creo que moreno le est haciendo da o a la presidenta nadie lo tiene en cuenta pero aparece siempre
3679159 nunca me refer a la situaci n de ning n funcionario con respecto a medidas que son de exlcusiva competencia del gobierno

3679161 en los primeros d as de abril por desempe arse como oficial de servicios fue llamado por marcos fidencio hidalgo alto oficial de la polic a durante esos a os en las primeras horas de la noche para preparar un veh culo conducido por el chofer de turno y por un agente como acompa ante para que trasladaran a sus domicilios a dos internos que sal an en libertad
3679162 el veh culo alistado estaba a cargo del chofer se apellidaba oviedo acompa ado por el guardiac rcel carlos antonio d cima

3679165 oh man i cant kick this thing this things a mess
3679166 its obviously not healed it had only been a month maybe and it kind of got split on the outside
3679167 i just love scoring no matter what no matter where it is
3679168 so scoring a goal in the olympics against a team like sweden is just a huge feat for me
3679169 shes such a great target player she has a nose for the goal
3679170 and with her there it allows kara lang to play wide right and were three pretty big players up top its nice to have her back
3679171 the ankle felt great and it was great to be out there and contribute in a hard game against sweden
3679172 in the same way that its much easier to drive a nail with a hammer than a screwdriver
3679173 and this one i stole from so n so then this little guy i found on the sidewalk on wabash in chicago that one day
3679174 remember the prime directive in police work first protect the donuts i want you to get a list of all the patients and all the visitors that were here
3679175 wouldnt it be easier just to get a list of the attendees at your last family reunion
3679176 you dont even know how to jump start a car
3679177 the fun has just begun its called payback you put me through hell now its time for me to return the favor
3679178 once i eliminate you i will be able to reclaim my treasured pawn
3679179 i am sorry it has come to this my queen of the night i wanted to make all your dreams come true
3679180 if you stand right there you and the moon will become one
3679181 does she bring that kind of energy to the bedroom
3679182 he says he doesnt want to waste time worrying about stefano tony goes back inside to help john
3679183 now that ive gotten to know her i figure i mustve lost my mind before stefano took it

3679207 i wasnt really angry but i just wanted to know why a doctor had been called
3679208 i would like to think that each call was for a genuine reason although getting the trainer to bandage both his wrists to keep his sweat guards in place was a bit pointless
3679209 he only broke my serve once which was a nice surprise i just didnt close him out when i had him on the ropes and with a player like that you have to

3679215 the force unleashed does not support the trophy system on ps3 i cant speculate about what might happen in the future though
3679216 it is a combination of fewer housing transactions because buying a house is a key time when people change supplier and more people buying mobile broadband instead of fixed line access
3679217 it would have been impossible for the market to sustain the surge in house prices that it had been experiencing in the boom period
3679218 it is a huge sum to anyone in the north east except for a few footballers
3679219 holding the bank rate is better than raising rates as one mpc member suggested last month but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs
3679220 if the government is going to come up with something then we need to know about it now
3679221 these otherwise law abiding citizens are promised money and told there is little or no risk of police action
3679222 stamp duty is always a factor when people buy and sell houses but we need to make sure that we support the financial system too
3679223 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
3679224 getting rid of stamp duty is no silver bullet it will not solve the ills of the housing market
3679225 im looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn
3679226 we have not concluded what exactly we need to do

3679248 get these unwanted people out of your areas otherwise we will bomb places where the militants are present
3679249 fighter jets and helicopter gunships were used to target the suspected places
3679250 bombings and operations are no solution however negotiations can lead to a solution and we invite the government to order ceasefire to pave the way for talks
3679251 we have formed different peace committees and volunteers will guard their respective areas against local and foreign militants presence
3679252 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
3679253 he felt it go during the game and early indications are that hell be out for two to three weeks
3679254 because unlike in the united states in the middle east it is the grooms side that pays for all the expenses of the wedding
3679255 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
3679256 we unreservedly apologize both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
3679257 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
3679258 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumors that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
3679259 until a few years ago there was no privacy law in this country and each case tried to stretch it a bit further
3679260 the mosley case was the one that stretched it that bit further still with the judge quite clear in his reasoning its forced editors to be more careful certainly in a case of this nature where its a very high profile royal

3679267 it smells like a mix of rotten fish and rotten meat its quite impressive
3679268 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
3679269 we need to refine our processes and our practices and that is now happening as a result of this case
3679270 really hes been convicted in the court of public opinion due to the actions of the police and the media
3679271 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
3679272 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development
3679273 were trying to learn how we can design roads and plan for roadways that are going to have less of an impact on snakes
3679274 his intentions may have been good but how he went about it wasnt

3679279 we hebben de actie voor de eerste keer gehouden als je dan meer dan 7000 euro ophaalt is dat heel acceptabel aldus jurjens de bedoeling is dat het niet om een eenmalige actie gaat maar dat die in elk geval volgend jaar een vervolg krijgt
3679280 in elk geval hebben we die mensen heel blij gemaakt vertelt jurjens

3679307 this is the beginning of a change for the good here as we bring more improvements to lax
3679308 we have a magic number in mind and were going to have a little conversation about math with secretary chertoff so we can figure out how much growth is needed for our customs area
3679309 my magic number is having enough officers in place so that there are no lines when you come into lax
3679310 as we get that technology here later this year it will take some of the passenger load off the backs of inspectors and it will enable us to process people more quickly
3679311 so whether its technology or personnel were going to be prepared to make this a more efficient process
3679312 were constantly reassessing and trying to do what we can to make this a more secure airport
3679313 for years we have known that the biggest risk for a terror attack at lax would be a vehicle bomb
3679314 these flower pots are going to be in more places around the airport to prevent vehicles loaded with bombs from smashing into the glass walls of these terminals
3679315 http 1 1 signals the web server to use gzip compression for file transfers
3679316 one effective method is to change the protocol latency is a problem because tcp waits for an acknowledgement
3679317 if you control the code and can deal with lost or mis ordered packets udp may be the way to go
3679318 1 local tcp acknowledgment the accelerator sends an ack back to the sending host immediately this ensures that the sender keeps putting packets on the wire instead waiting for the ack from the actual recipient
3679319 2 udp conversion the accelerators change the tcp stream to udp to cross the wan when the packet reaches the accelerator on the far end it is switched back to tcp you can think of this a tunneling tcp inside of udp although unlike a vpn the udp tunnel does not add any overhead to the stream
3679320 3 caching the accelerators notice data patterns and cache repeating information when a sender transmits data that is already in the cache the accelerators only push the cache id across the wan an example of this would be several users accessing the same file from a cifs share across your wan the accelerators would cache the file after the first user retrieves it and use a token to transfer the subsequent requests
3679321 4 compression in addition to caching network accelerators are able to compress some of the data being transmitted the accelerator on the other end of the wan decompresses the data before sending it to its destination compressed data can be sent in fewer packets thus reducing the apparent time to send
3679322 for many applications udp will work just as well as tcp and will work better over long connections udp works best for temporal data such as streaming audio or video or multiplayer games but can also be used for any application where the only data you care about is the current sample such as stock prices or weather data
3679323 active flow pipelining extends the tcp performance improvements by terminating the tcp connections locally and using a more efficient transport protocol between wx and wxc platforms this feature significantly benefits application performance on high bandwidth or high latency connections
3679324 data streamlining works by reducing the transmission of redundant bytes and by optionally prioritizing data based on bandwidth and latency requirements data streamlining works across the key applications that enterprises care about the most like windows and unix file sharing including ms office email including ms exchange and lotus notes cad pdm applications erp databases and performing data reduction on all applications that rely on tcp
3679325 molecular sequence reduction msr is the flagship compression algorithm of the wx and wxc platforms the patented technology which has enabled enterprises to realize as great as a 10 fold increase in wan capacity has its roots in dna pattern matching msr compression recognizes repeated data patterns and replaces them with labels dramatically reducing wan transmissions msr technology operates in memory and its dictionary can store hundreds of megabytes of patterns the msr reduction capabilities benefit a broad cross section of application types it effectively reduces both short chatty applications such as citrix and http as well as larger data patterns such as word files because msr is dictionary based it is able to eliminate patterns even when they are separated by large amounts of other data

3679391 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3679392 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3679393 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3679394 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years

3679628 the fact tom has a partner who is 26 there are going to be differences to us it was good because we can say right what did you learn from this with the world championships next year they are going to be so much better
3679629 tom and blake are looking forward to regrouping and looking forward to the future
3679630 sometimes things are said in the heat of the moment which shouldnt be said out in public im sure blake in hindsight would have decided to act differently
3679631 the boys were telling me to believe in myself i knew i could beat him ourradi he beat me two months ago on countback but watching the video i could see what i had to do
3679632 im only 19 and all im really looking to do here is perform
3679633 i was annoyed because he was caught for the exact same thing again
3679634 so thats a real mistake when you dont learn from it the first time and theres no need for him to be in there because hes a very good mover
3679635 the olympics is a big stage but im getting over that now next fight hopefully ill be better
3679636 i wasnt getting many scores but the lads started saying left to body and right hand to the head and they were right once i got that off i was scoring
3679637 i was saying to him all along youll be in for 2012 but he just went and qualified straight away
3679638 john joes timing is excellent normally but today wasnt what it should be but hes in the tournament now and his next opponent is a world silver medalist so hes back to a situation where hes a nobody going in and he performs well in that environment
3679639 even the chinese were on our side when they saw the number eight on the hood i was kind of concerned when i got docked the points i knew i had to get them back and it was a bit of a relief when he got deducted two as well so quickly
3679640 a year ago my main concern was a senior title now im here at the olympics its unbelievable
3679641 it wasnt the most fantastic of performances but the last time they fought was very similar there was a bit of needle between both of them and you could see that so were happy with the result not that happy with the performance but hes overturned a previous decision just like john joe joyce did that has to be good
3679642 supermarkets are playing robin hood with their customers in northern ireland
3679643 they are robbing peter to pay paul what they do in my opinion is they reduce perhaps the price of fuel but they compensate for any shortcomings or losses by raising prices in the kiosks mini stores at the petrol filling stations where customers are not nearly so careful about checking prices as they are when they are shopping in the main outlets
3679644 there is likely to be little change in this scenario before the end of the year
3679645 northern ireland customers who spend more than the average mainland based family according to the office for national statistics ons will have to wait for quite a long time before they are likely to see any significant price reductions in their grocery bills
3679646 we move quickly to pass on cost savings to our customers whenever and wherever possible
3679647 thats why we were the first to cut the price of petrol and the first supermarket to drop the price of core groceries to 50p
3679648 it has been widely reported that the cost of global commodities have risen substantially and this clearly has an impact on the price of a variety of food items uk food retailing is one of the most competitive markets in the world and sainsburys policy is to be competitive on price whilst paying a fair price to suppliers
3679649 we are committed to offering quality products at great prices we are constantly running hundreds of promotions
3679650 customers also get clubcard points on their purchases and we are working hard with our suppliers to minimise outside influences and introduce price cuts and promotions where possible
3679651 at a time when every penny counts anything that can be done to reduce household bills is not only welcome but needed at this point in time
3679652 i went to sydney as reserve which was a fantastic experience but also a frustrating one i was slightly wishing one of my fellow competitors might get a bruise and give me the opportunity to compete but they didnt i got the opportunity here and the horse went very well in all three phases and for a young horse i am very proud of him
3679653 i expected a team gold but not an individual gold

3679664 old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition
3679665 right now were definitely not confident with our prospects in the world not confident about our future or our economy and barack obama is definitely the kind of leader that has the ability to uplift people the way that ronald reagan did
3679666 of course hes more liberal than i am hes more liberal than most people within our organization because we are republicans but he has the ability to bring people together so we can solve our problems that weve just ignored for the last two decades because of partisanship

3679710 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3679711 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3679712 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3679713 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3679714 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3679715 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3679716 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself

3679748 this was a game that potentially could have really been a major downer for us and we actually turned it around and made it a great win

3679803 to be at the top with so many great olympic athletes its amazing
3679804 that is fast i dont know how he is doing everybody is thinking about hes feeling and still the world record

3679811 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3679812 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3679813 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3679814 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3679815 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3679816 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3679817 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3679818 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3679819 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3679820 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3679821 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3679822 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3679823 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3679824 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3679825 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3679826 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3679827 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
3679828 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3679829 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3679830 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3679831 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3679832 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3679833 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3679834 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3679835 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks
3679836 there is no regret if israel decided to cancel the lull and hamas is ready to defend the dignity of the palestinian people
3679837 did not make any change and its obligations were not completely carried out
3679838 hamas accepted the lull to ease the suffering of the palestinian people and to take advantage of the calm to boost and reinforce our force
3679839 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3679840 we have said that the sanctions should not be lifted without the return of all abductees and our stance will never change
3679841 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results

3679843 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3679844 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
