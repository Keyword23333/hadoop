5510013 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5510014 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5510015 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5510016 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5510017 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5510018 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5510019 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5510020 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

5510025 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5510026 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did

5510064 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5510065 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5510066 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5510067 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5510068 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5510069 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5510070 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5510071 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5510072 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5510073 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5510074 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5510075 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5510076 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5510077 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5510078 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5510079 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5510080 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes

5510084 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5510085 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5510086 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5510087 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5510088 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5510089 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5510090 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5510091 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5510092 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5510093 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts

5510101 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5510102 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5510103 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5510104 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5510105 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5510106 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5510107 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

5510111 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5510112 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5510113 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5510114 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5510115 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5510116 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue

5510127 in the 21st century it is a shame people like bob gough get published knowing how racially diverse our district is republican will kraus should be ashamed to have a campaign affiliated with such remarks
5510128 either republican will kraus removes bob gough from his campaign and apologizes to the voters of his district for being affiliated with bob gough or he fully agrees with such racist and extremist statements its that simple
5510129 missourians both democrat and republican deserve better than such hate rhetoric i pledge to move missouri forward with real change away from the failed policies of matt blunt and hate rhetoric of bob gough all of which will kraus unfortunately supports

5510138 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5510139 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5510140 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5510141 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5510147 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5510148 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5510149 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5510150 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5510151 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5510152 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5510153 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5510154 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5510155 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5510156 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5510157 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5510158 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
5510159 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
5510160 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology

5510163 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5510164 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5510165 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5510166 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5510167 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5510168 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5510169 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5510170 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5510171 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5510172 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5510173 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5510174 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5510175 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5510176 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5510177 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5510178 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5510179 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5510180 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star

5510184 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5510185 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5510186 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5510187 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5510188 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5510189 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5510190 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5510191 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5510192 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5510193 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5510194 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5510201 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

5510204 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5510205 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5510206 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5510207 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5510208 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5510209 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5510210 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5510211 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5510212 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5510213 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
5510214 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
5510215 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
5510216 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
5510217 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
5510218 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
5510219 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
5510220 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
5510221 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
5510222 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
5510223 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
5510224 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5510225 he should do community service in an old folks home or pre school
5510226 im the one whos going to decide who gets fired i and only i am the one whos going to fire you people one by one every week until ive got my apprentice so you can forget about flicking your hair back and flashing your eyes and having a handsome attack cos it aint going to make any difference all right and heres a bit of a warning never ever underestimate me because you will be making a fatal error
5510227 all across the country places where people gather for good food and lively conversation are top destinations for campaigners so we wanted to bring that experience directly to both conventions
5510228 between the live cnn political team coverage and the great food we expect the cnn grills as the cnn diner was four years ago in new york city to be must visit destinations for convention goers
5510229 were proud to offer students and educators the high quality content they have come to expect from cnn in a cost free commercial free educational setting
5510230 our goal is to help teachers and parents take key concepts from the curriculum and make them relevant to what kids see and experience in the real world
5510231 he should do community service in an old folks home or pre school
5510232 for the love of money is the root of all evil
5510233 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5510234 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5510235 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5510236 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5510237 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5510238 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5510239 i have serious sadness over two things in the congress
5510240 i know its the two biggest issues that youre concerned about but 107 days until the election maybe its 106 by now and things will be better
5510241 this will not happen without the election of barack obama as president of the united states
5510242 i need your help you speak to and influence and connect with so many people
5510243 proposing to get a little increase in oil driiling for fuel to be sold to china 10 to 15 years from now as a solution to our rising gasoline prices makes about as much sense as responding to an attack from afghanistan by invading some other country
5510244 the highest and best thing for me to do is to focus on trying to enlarge the political space in which elected officials address the climate crisis i m devoting my life to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines that supports the truly massive policy change we need to have
5510245 it is true that it would be healthier for us as if we consumed less meat
5510246 i myself am a meat eater and perhaps that has something to do with it
5510247 wearing another hat i have tried to find ways to break down the walls surrounding the television medium and invite people to express themselves on the television medium in a democratized way on current tv
5510248 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5510249 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5510250 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5510251 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5510252 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5510253 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5510254 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5510255 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5510256 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5510257 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5510258 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5510259 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5510260 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5510261 my mother has end stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust pct the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5510262 i said are you sure and she said i may be dying but i know how much money i had in my handbag
5510263 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5510264 we thought it would be a long process but allen was greedy we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers
5510265 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5510266 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5510267 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5510268 it must have dropped about 20 feet it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5510269 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5510270 its an extremely dangerous road its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off
5510271 i heard what sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5510272 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker bus it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and rolled over
5510273 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one to university hospital of north staffordshire twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital
5510274 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and to weaken the georgian state
5510275 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures
5510276 were not seeking an adversarial relationship but we cant go on as normal at a minimum were looking at the high level meetings and whether that can go on
5510277 talks in the nato russia council are essential we need open lines of communication
5510278 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5510279 when they dropped him off black boy kept saying dont say nothing to nobody
5510280 i looked in and saw a chair knocked over and a table overturned
5510281 its all consistent with what was found at the scene
5510282 fasten your seat belts its going to be a bumpy night
5510283 recognizing that the causes and extent of recently observed climatic change are the subject of intense debates in the climate science community and that oft repeated assertions of a supposed
5510284 what i found interesting in the ipcc report is how blatant the statistical fraud is omitting the competing explanation from the models completely while pretending that they are using their models to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural warming these people are going to hang on to their power grab until the bitter end
5510285 a canvass of more than 51 000 scientists with the association of professional engineers geologists and geophysicists of alberta apegga found 68 of them disagree with the statement
5510286 the debate on the scientific causes of recent climate change is settled
5510287 i danas postoje politi ka udovi ta eljna ubijanja kako bi vlastitu osrednjost nadoknadili istrjebljenjem itavog naroda

5510291 all of sudden we heard a crash of glass and we thought well thats the end of it and all of a sudden the vehicle came through and we ran i cant explain it
5510292 basically it looks like the driver either got the foot feet and the brake mixed up or the gas pedal stuck and she went through the building
5510293 they were just fine just a little shook up from driving through the post office
5510294 everythings been knocked over tipped over the posting machines and the cancellations machines all the file cabinets all the post office boxes for the customers in town theyre all laying on the ground
5510295 everything that was broken can be replaced people cant be
5510296 this is a very hard moment for all of us
5510297 we have been expecting you to perform in 2008 but now we just watch you quit if you really want to dedicate yourself to the country you would crawl to the finish line but you always meant to lose
5510298 deceiving people by telling everyone he was in good shape
5510299 this is such a pity my guess is that it is the pressure from 1 3 billion people which hurt him i dont think it has much to do with the injury for even if he was injured he would have had time to recover i think he might have psychological difficulties
5510300 this is a pity for everyone in china we all expected him to win
5510301 i had an image of him as a powerful handsome man that hasnt changed
5510302 i can understand why some people are angry but i dont agree with them i think chinese people put too much pressure on liu this has changed the way i think about athletes and the olympics
5510303 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
5510304 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
5510305 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
5510306 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5510307 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5510308 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5510309 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5510310 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place
5510311 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
5510312 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
5510313 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5510314 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5510315 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5510316 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5510317 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5510318 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5510319 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5510320 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5510321 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5510322 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5510323 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5510324 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5510325 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5510326 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5510327 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5510328 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5510329 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5510330 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5510331 the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better enable and protect their digital life

5510339 i cannot rule out that they might use mercenaries with slavic appearance for a provocation clad in the uniform of russian servicemen in order to commit subversive acts both on ossetian and russian territory
5510340 russia s tv channel zvezda which has five camera crews working in tskhinvali aired the same footage two days before on monday
5510341 sky news showed its report with no sound whereas the people showed in the russian report could be heard speaking russian and ossetian languages the crying people shown in the report were heard cursing georgian president saakashvili for destructions and manslaughter

5510356 neither very good events nor very bad events seem to change peoples happiness much in the long term most people it seems revert back to some kind of baseline happiness level
5510357 other things that didnt alter the happiness curve include income marital status or education

5510364 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5510374 i think 75 percent plus one vote is a great victory the rest is irrelevant the cme was able to get a super majority as they presented a strong proposition
5510375 cme wants this so badly because the futures market is one of the few monopolies left in the world and its a monopoly because they have their own clearing operation
5510376 they have yet to do a global deal or an acquisition in a different asset class

5510415 much of the initial increase in shares on loan was apparently borrowed as a precautionary measure to guard against overly stringent interpretations of the rule a possible lack of exemptions for market makers and a potential dearth of shares within a market governed by a new paradigm
5510416 in the days following the announcement of the rule however prime brokers moved to double the number of shares in these companies that they had borrowed
5510417 some securities lending desk managers explained that they initially increased their borrowings in mid july because of the uncertainty of how far reaching the new rule would be for example it was not until friday july 18 that the sec decided that market makers would be exempt from the temporary order to pre borrow shares in these 19 issues but by then the huge increase in securities lending volumes had already occurred by july 21 16 of the 19 issues 11 of the 12 with a major u s market presence saw their loan volume increase more than 33 and 13 of these 19 stocks 8 of the 12 with a major u s market presence were considered special or hard to borrow

5510435 can you confirm that at amp t is not monitoring and has no plans to monitor its customers traffic or other online activities to detect possible copyright infringements
5510436 increasingly they will be partnering with us they will be doing deals with us
5510437 despite our best efforts we cant do this alone we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes the good news is that were beginning to see some of these solutions emerge in particular in europe and asia

5510450 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5510455 of all the things ive ever lost i think i miss my mind the most
5510456 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5510457 i think we not only lost the game but lost our catcher possibly for the rest of the games
5510458 the umpire should have ejected schierholtz thats when the game got out of hand we do not throw to hit people we do not teach that in china or in the u s
5510459 we were focused on winning the ballgame and not getting into any kind of conflict
5510460 it was a close game 4 0 at the time the outfielder was really shallow and i knew it would be a close play
5510461 it was a heat of the moment thing i did what i had to do to score the run
5510462 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5510463 crude oil prices have been going down which in turn has meant lower gasoline and diesel prices lower oil prices are mainly due to reduced demand caused by high prices and slowing economies in the u s and elsewhere
5510464 it appears the natural gas price spike earlier this year was more of a speculative bubble natural gas supply situation looks good right now and the recent price decline reflects that reality

5510486 the original egyptian organization has spawned branches in 70 countries
5510487 there are entities that exist in many countries all over the world these entities have the same ideology principle and objectives but they work in different circumstances and different contexts so it is reasonable to have decentralization in action so that every entity works according to its circumstances and according to the problems it is facing and in their framework
5510488 we call on the public to carefully examine any allegations spread by special interest groups in the u

5510493 the minister has agreed to pay a total of 10 million egyptian pounds us 1 87 million to about 1 000 members of the gamaa islamiya who won court cases against the ministry
5510494 the islamists took the ministry to court after they were detained without trial or held in prison despite release orders
5510495 can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad
5510496 its unclear who is actually in charge and whose rules apply to the information thats being collected and shared and distributed through these fusion centers
5510497 beyond normal law enforcement functions and start becoming intelligence collectors against protest groups the reports that we obtained make clear that there was no indication of any sort of criminal activity and yet that investigation went on for 14 months and these reports were uploaded into a federal database when all these agencies are authorized to go out and start collecting this information and putting it in areas where its accessible by the intelligence community its a very dangerous proposition for our democracy
5510498 reinvest their police budget toward real community security new elementary schools health care for the uninsured providing clean renewable energy
5510499 our taxpayer dollars went to pay people to infiltrate and take notes on our meetings and its absolutely enraging a lot of this homeland security funding is an absolute sham its being used to actually crush dissent not to keep us safer in any real way
5510500 suck on this im not going to pander to our racist past by balancing my ticket with a middle aged white guy you now have a choice between two very competent black men and two very senile white men if you still want to be a racist and vote along racial lines youre going to have to want to be a racist very badly
5510501 the reason we are so strongly against ip is because of the camels nose problem a small amount of ip at best provides a small benefit and is an invitation to have a lot of ip

5510527 there are a lot of young enthusiastic energetic and innovative people with great ideas in the ict sector but they are incredibly poor in articulating those issues on paper
5510528 out of 100 business plans on my table 90 dont have the right information needed
5510529 we receive requests for funding from kenya tanzania uganda rwanda and burundi but unfortunately we screen them too fast
5510530 it is a lot of work to go through them and turn them around people need to get more training and come up with business plans that are fundable
5510531 it is true some of our most innovative engineering students do not know how to write business plans capable of being funded but that is also a challenge among established business people

5510544 there is a shortage of the yellow metal in the bullion banks and traders this is due to unexpected demand from the public during the past three months buying activity was bleak however this is only a correction and this will stabilise soon but there will be no price rise further as it is only momentary
5510545 indias gold imports this year so far were 225 tonnes as against 800 tonnes in the previous year this puts pressure on gold supplies in the domestic market the price may not go up very much as global factors influence prices rather than local market dynamics if the dollar strengthens against euro or crude oil prices ease then gold prices will come down further

5510559 pero lo que me convenci para incorporarme a la lucha armada en 1984 cuando ten a 21 a os fue una conversaci n que tuve con mi mejor amigo gordon webster
5510560 no puedo quit rmelo de la cabeza sobre todo una foto que vi al d a siguiente en el peri dico de un hijo de una de las v ctimas pens y sigo pensando que independientemente de que mi causa fuera justa hab a hecho un da o terrible a personas que no ten an por qu estar relacionadas con el enemigo
5510561 dije que el hecho de que nos estuvi ramos matando unos a otros demostraba hasta qu punto est bamos hechos una mierda que yo era un s ntoma de una enfermedad nacional pero que no era el pecado original
5510562 yo era un soldado en una guerra pero cuando me encontr cara a cara en la comisi n con un polic a que hab a resultado gravemente herido en una operaci n que hab a dirigido yo un hombre que todav a padec a las cicatrices f sicas y que hab a visto c mo se destru a su vida personal reaccion como ser humano m s all de las justificaciones pol ticas y me sent mal hablamos de lo que hab a ocurrido porque nunca he rehuido las consecuencias de mis acciones estuvo educado conmigo sin rencor
5510563 que tienen m s poder que la gente normal deben cumplir unas exigencias morales m s elevadas que otros
5510564 la misma gente que tanto admira como yo a nelson mandela que ha dicho alguna vez que yo soy un h roe del cna y que me felicit por mi nombramiento para el cargo
5510565 mi decisi n y mi capacidad operativa ahora y en los d as de la lucha dejan al descubierto la indecisi n y la debilidad de algunas de esas personas que se han vuelto en mi contra pero lo nico que he hecho con mi actuaci n en la polic a ha sido mostrarme duro en defensa del imperio de la ley

5510576 we are going to see more flash flooding and more storms we need to plan accordingly
5510577 there will be a 20 per cent increase in precipitation in the future there will be increases in wind speed and more storms when it does rain it will be more heavily
5510578 any future significant development will have to carry out a flood risk assessment as part of the planning process
5510579 it essentially means the end of any major construction on flood plains
5510580 the lack of urgency from the government is shocking when so many homes businesses and communities are in danger of being washed out
5510581 overall it will be changeable but the rainfall will not be as heavy or torrential as we have seen
5510582 no immediate plans to offer mortgages but we may launch a more wide ranging retail product line at some stage in the future
5510583 we would recognise the need for there to be a clear distinction between the two operations

5510591 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5510592 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5510593 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5510594 ive had so many enjoyable evenings down here with my family and friends watching movies
5510595 our business being off anywhere from 15 to 40 percent
5510596 its more than just a restaurant where you come to get great food its a community gathering spot where people feel this is my home away from home
5510597 its hard for everyone so maybe we need to start helping each other a little more

5510601 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5510602 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5510603 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5510604 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5510605 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5510606 screw the schedule well maybe not exactly like that in church were going to have some more singing and music until mccains butt is in that green room

5510612 this is not what the army is about and this is not what the warriors of the unit are about and we will not tolerate it
5510613 i have long said that the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5510614 u s policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaida and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5510615 critical theater in countering the threat of al qaida and violent islamic extremism
5510616 i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5510617 this is an intentional act to maliciously destroy this playground for absolutely no reason
5510618 it is a sad loss to those who frequent the park incuding our family
5510619 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
5510620 where theres a will theres a way and where theres a way then theres usually a stop sign somewhere along the road
5510621 based on demonstrated achievement accomplishments and an increasing preference for the use of digital media channels to discover information build knowledge and share insights

5510623 the study of god presupposes that there is a god to study what evidence is there to support this
5510624 o brave old world that has such people in it
5510625 you can save yourself time by confining your attention to two systems hinduism and christianity i believe these are the two serious options for an adult mind materialism is a philosophy for boys the purely moral systems like stoicism and confucianism are philosophies for aristocrats islam is only a christian heresy and buddhism a hindu heresy both are simplifications inferior to the things simplified as for the old pagan religions i think we could say that whatever was of value in them survives either in hinduism or in christianity or in both and there only they are the two system which have come down still alive into the present without leaving the past behind
5510626 goodbye christianity then unless you want to repudiate the notion that yahweh is good

5510628 the study of god presupposes that there is a god to study what evidence is there to support this
5510629 currently we are planning on playing the game certainly the circumstances can change
5510630 we will continue to monitor the storm and its progress we will continue to consult with government agencies as well as the angels and the american league
5510631 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game
5510632 well monitor the weather throughout the day if theres going to be a call to postpone it likely would be made in the afternoon
5510633 right now it look like theres a chance were going to be able to stay here and grind it out at the hotel

5510636 the west gharib acquisition established transglobe as a producing operator in the middle east and we are very pleased to increase our interest

5510639 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade
5510640 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5510641 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5510642 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5510643 i was on the beach at 5 in the morning and they were in bed by 6 at night fun trip i liked everything there was about it
5510644 i was pulling harder than anybody for us to win that game
5510645 ive done it since i was a kid so i dont think about the technique so much
5510646 its just doing it ive kind of got the muscle memory in there
5510647 for a long time they didnt even take long snappers
5510648 i was flattered and felt the responsibility to go out there and do the job right
5510649 im trying to do some maintenance to keep it strong
5510650 he had a long career and all of a sudden there was a mistake and thats what hes always known for
5510651 im hoping i get out before i lose the ability to snap it right now it feels great it feels like every other year
5510652 and i think mom and dad are getting tired and picking up and moving every six months
5510653 you can laugh at me for saying one year at a time but thats the reality for me
5510654 hes been through a rough week and a half his fight is still not over for his daughter
5510655 hes back and hes trying to concentrate on his work but knowing hes got part of his heart still with his family
5510656 i think i had to do something to be fair to the team and to be fair to olson
5510657 olson needs to get some success and be put in a situation thats not as stressful and pressure packed as it would appear its been for him his last three starts
5510658 it has been in the back of my mind that i havent been doing my job
5510659 i tried to make adjustments its just being consistent has been hard this year ive showed brief blips of it but i need to have it more especially to help the team out
5510660 hes a guy we feel like understands the position well
5510661 hes got good ball skills so were bringing him in not just for a camp body im anxious to see him play and see what hes got and to see if theres a fit for us
5510662 thats really the first thing we saw and hes in pretty good shape
5510663 hes a bullpen guy that we can use in situations where we need a ground ball

5510677 we didnt make any plays i probably held the ball too long and made a lot of mental errors
5510678 the productivity wasnt there for the offense so you can never sit and say the quarterback played well when that doesnt happen
5510679 there are some decisions im sure well look at and well learn from based on once again the whole offense it was not a good evening for any of our quarterbacks
5510680 by no means do we think this was going to be easy for any of the quarterbacks theyre young experience is not on their side they need to play games

5510684 i had no right and its a pretty selfish act to get behind the wheel once ive been drinking
5510685 the fact is that you still have some control over your life to avoid drinking and driving and yet you have not done so
5510686 i just want to get on with my life basically
5510687 all i can say is i promise you wont see me again in here

5510690 hes been a warrior for this organization and hes done a great job for this football team for me since ive been here the last couple of years
5510691 we were all hoping that by this time he would be in a position to compete he hasnt been able to its a very difficult injury
5510692 hes going to make a decision and we want him to make that decision with all the information thats out there and not base it on any misconceptions or myths
5510693 he got a higher level of information than any other player has gotten he was really pleasantly surprised
5510694 we thought the meeting went well and marian expressed the same thing
5510695 i have a lot of respect for how they handled that
5510696 i dont control what they do i just represent marian
5510697 he really has no decisions to make the experience playing for the has been great we have no bones to pick about anything i really feel that marian has been treated well and has enjoyed his career there to date
5510698 we really really really hope alone in the dark continues to do well
5510699 as expected it was a challenging quarter for brooke capital corporation
5510700 our new era and operating initiatives previously announced have been implemented and managements actions have resulted in brooke capital becoming a leaner and more efficient organization we expect to return to profitability in the third quarter
5510701 losses were incurred in the second quarter primarily as the result of shrinking the number of brooke franchise locations by closing relocating or liquidating poorer performing locations difficult credit markets have had a significant adverse affect on the sale of new franchise locations by the company without revenues from the sale of new locations the company has been forced to reduce expenses significantly the resulting expense reductions include personnel layoffs facility closings and write offs of producer development investments
5510702 kyle garst and dane devlin did a good job of transitioning our company in the second quarter to the limited growth business model required to wait out the current credit markets to assist in returning brooke capital to profitability in the third quarter i have taken a more active role in the company although i remain chairman and kyle remains president of brooke capital i have assumed the responsibilities of chief executive officer so kyle can focus on the sale of troubled locations
5510703 while kyle and dane were going through a difficult downsizing at brooke capital during the second quarter i had focused my efforts on aleritas capital another company in which both brooke corporation and i have significant ownership interests now that aleritas capital has returned to profitability i have redirected much of my attention to brooke capital with expectations of returning it to profitability in the third quarter
5510704 the value of brooke capital corporation is its insurance distribution system which generates about 1 billion per year in premiums until credit markets improve brooke capital corporation is focused on improving the quality of its agency force and distribution channels

5510712 and while were not suggesting the market for teen and young adult men is not a strong market men between 18 and 45 still represent 37 percent of the game playing market its the other demographics which are posting significant growth until those original gamers cease playing either due to death or physical incapacity losing interest appears unlikely meaning new gamers entering the market will not be replacing those leaving theyll just be adding to the swelling numbers worldwide parents also fall into the older gamer category and the sheer number of them playing games with their children is another factor driving industry growth some surveys npd suggest that 93 percent of parents playing video games have children who are playing too in fact nearly half the games sold in 2006 held an e rating and with 39 the average age of a game buyer that would suggest the mom and dad market is a major one

5510790 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and touched with our hands concerning the word of life that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you so that you may have fellowship with us and our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ
5510791 that its those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular
5510792 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
5510793 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
5510794 guys dont always feel chipper in the first part of the week when they get dinged up but they find a way to push to saturday
5510795 thats how hes approaching the thing and thats how were approaching the thing to play in saturdays game
5510796 im sure its his wish to get as many turns as he can
5510797 sometimes they just flat dont know what to do do i shut down and sit down do i show up and treat how do you do that
5510798 they have never been part of a training room culture nor do they want to be
5510799 injuries happen its a part of football hell work hard to get back out and hell know when hes ready
5510800 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing
5510801 you cant try to make it bigger than it is its a good opportunity and hopefully i can perform well and we can perform well as a team i dont think you can try to make it more than it is
5510802 as a quarterback you have to understand that youre going to make some mistakes but you have to minimize them and you have to get over them
5510803 you cant kind of dwell on those things you try and learn from them and so i looked at it today and youve got to throw that behind you and get ready for this week
5510804 we took him off the 5 yard line and he took them 11 plays and i thought he was very efficient at moving the team
5510805 he had a throw that wed like to have back but again its a learning curve for matt
5510806 the positive is that when things went bad matt kept his head up
5510807 he was into the game the real sign is going to be how when he comes back and has the opportunity to play next week when his number gets called
5510808 four years ago the dragon was a reluctant presidential candidate
5510809 fans have asked if hell be running again but given the importance of the upcoming election it seemed appropriate that he would back barack obama the candidate whose politics most reflect his own savage dragon will be giving barack obama his full support
5510810 it was the business side of it i really didnt want to do it because i love football and running around
5510811 it was really no big deal it gave me extended time to further prepare myself for the season
5510812 but he was competing and fighting hell probably be a little sore tomorrow but hes in good shape
5510813 i cant worry about it now i havent lost faith in them i still think they want me here thats all ive got to go on
5510814 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5510815 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5510816 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5510817 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5510818 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5510819 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5510820 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5510821 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5510822 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5510823 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5510824 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5510825 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5510826 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5510827 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker
5510828 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events

5510901 dress was unanimously cordially disliked has the television service not the right of discussing the matter of dress with soloists in order that they should look as well as possible on the screen the cut away shots to members of the audience should be handled with care while the thoughtful girl made a most attractive picture and interfered in no way with the music the shots of the youth in the grey topper and of the shop girl wagging her head in time to the music are frankly not conducive to concentration on the music and i think better kept to the intervals between items
5510902 i want to be standing there when that no trespassing sign comes down in fact i want to be the one to take it down
5510903 if the other property owners wanted to open it im sure we would support and honor that
5510904 we have a lot of challenges to work out and i think this is the best way to do it

5510916 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5510917 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5510918 so he obama doesnt see nuclear as the only solution to the high price of oil but hes realistic that its one of the things that we have to get right
5510919 this person didnt stop there were no skid marks just plowed us down like road kill and didnt even hit the brakes until he got up to highway b
5510920 this guy was probably doing 80 miles an hour because before i could turn around and warn gordon he already hit us and i knocked the mirror off the truck with my elbow and ended up i flew about 20 yards to a tree and thats what stopped me
5510921 well my heart is broken this person took my best friend from me and almost took my other best friend ive know the guy since i was in high school everybody loves gordo
5510922 we have a lot of remorse and guilt were just not its just too hard to describe
5510923 i think its unfair that we have to as taxpayers pay for something else thats like none of our business
5510924 the money should be going for other problems that are going on here in town instead of whats going on in there
5510925 the females who cooperate with a social relationship with mr hughes get favorable treatment and those who dont get unfavorable treatment

5510932 its everyones dream but its something ive always wanted and its what i have now im going to stretch it and take advantage of it sure its a lot of pressure but you know what its worth it and its worth signing something for someone even if youre on your own personal time which is something im notorious for doing when i go out with my friends and when i do get recognized i say hello i do sign things people say why are you doing that making as much as i do those people are the ones that make my career and thats something i never forget
5510933 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5510934 everybody worked together so well everybody did their jobs everything just worked i really think that us learning each other and me learning the bike and what it takes to be a championship contending team has come together for us
5510935 like everybody we wish wed qualified higher but it actually worked out in our favor where we qualified we had a good side of the ladder with some of the really tough competitors going out early not that anybodys not a tough competitor anymore because every single person in the other lane feels like a final round these days but there were bikes that were faster than some of the ones i had to race and they went out early so that was a little bit less stressful
5510936 we had a plan on sunday to win as many rounds as we could and keep our nose to the grindstone
5510937 we kept having things go wrong but we kept fighting and fighting and kept going rounds
5510938 every time i turned around angelle was looking down and not watching im proud of her for that she made everybody nervous all day when they raced her
5510939 we rolled up to the starting line against matt for the deja vu final
5510940 and i said real loud so everybody could hear me if it starts up well be better than last week it fired and everybody smiled
5510941 if it hadnt started i believe lou and jeremy pringle and terry daniels of rush racing would have called me into their office first thing monday morning
5510942 we went 6 95 first round then we tuned and it slowed down
5510943 we said ok that didnt work and went back the other way and it slowed down again usually when you go back to where you were it picks back up so there might be something wrong with that motor were gonna take it all apart and make sure its ready for indy were gonna run two engines there instead of one like we did at brainerd and reading ken johnson is taking the bike and engines back to the shop were gonna work on them and come out as best we can for the u s nationals
5510944 we were losing power every round and matt smith is just one heck of a competitor its gonna take a lot to take him down but i do believe we have it
5510945 she left on matt rode straight and shifted on time which is all we can ask im very proud to be able to go to two finals in a row going to these finals is right what we were trying to do id like to win every race but peaking when it counts is a good thing its typical of our race team to peak towards the end of the year
5510946 i think everybody gave their all and there wasnt anything else we could have done its just the way the cards fell im very proud of my guys
5510947 and i want to say a big thank you to our sponsors and family at rush racing
5510948 were fourth in the world in points and i think we can move into third after indy
5510949 and if we keep going the way were going i think well be there the teams starting to really come together i want to qualify number one at indy win the ringers gloves battle and win the u s nationals
5510950 i really thought we were gonna get our first win of the year but we didnt and i am totally motivated and so ready to go to indy because i think our team is on a roll and its all gonna fall into place just at the right time
5510951 we made a huge move up to fourth in points and things are falling right where we want them to fall when the countdown starts and we are gonna be contenders im excited about it matt smith is not gonna be the only thorn in everybodys side
5510952 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5510953 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5510954 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5510955 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5510956 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5510957 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5510958 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5510959 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5510960 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5510961 is stamped on the inside of the box so i am assuming that this lens has been refurbished i have not run a film test with this lens on a camera
5510962 abram wilson has a proven track record of setting government priorities and ensuring our tax dollars are spent wisely
5510963 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5510964 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5510965 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5510966 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5510967 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5510968 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5510969 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5510970 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5510971 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5510972 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5510973 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5510974 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5510975 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5510976 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5510977 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5510985 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially
5510986 those with whom he is negotiating georgias accession to nato
5510987 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
5510988 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region

5511007 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4 obama has generated a lot of news by being the first african american nominee and he is less well known than mccain and therefore theres more to report on but the disparity is so wide that it doesnt look good

5511031 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5511032 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15
5511033 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5511034 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5511035 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies

5511059 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5511060 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

5511079 social engineers target those who are in a lower position in the company hierarchy
5511080 the department is trying to remove seniority from the promotions criteria altogether but some kind of mix of the procedures used in the vocational and primary sectors is the most likely middle ground for agreement
5511081 the government needs to put extra compensation in place for people as it did in dublin six years ago people are suffering in severe conditions and the government just does not seem to have a grip on this
5511082 no one can do anything about the weather but defences should have been in place for this
5511083 places like carlow deserve to get the same help as dublin did in the past especially for people who cant get insurance due to previous flooding
5511084 they will just be guidelines and this does not excuse the piecemeal spending on flood defences we have seen so far
5511085 this government has ignored the recommendations of its own 2004 report into the urgent need for action and spent just 23m across the country last year when its own experts say that 400m is needed
5511086 flood relief works for carlow town have been promised by the government for years but people are flooded again and again as nothing is done
5511087 for some people this is the third time this year they have been flooded
5511088 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5511089 i think the allies are going to be firm that this was a violation of georgias territorial integrity
5511090 if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink in doing this you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads
5511091 we are not fighting against humans we are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world so put on all the armor that god gives then when that evil day comes you will be able to defend yourself and when the battle is over you will still be standing firm be ready let the truth be like a belt around your waist and let god s justice protect you like armor your desire to tell the good news about peace should be like shoes on your feet let your faith be like a shield and you will be able to stop all the flaming arrows of the evil one let god s saving power be like a helmet and for a sword use god s message that comes from the spirit never stop praying especially for others always pray by the power of the spirit stay alert and keep praying for god s people
5511092 lord do not let me only see the obvious let me see the possible the potential your hand working through situations of my life
5511093 they are plans for good and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope in those days when you pray i will listen if you look for me wholeheartedly you will find me i will be found by you
5511094 i will end your captivity and restore your fortunes i will gather you out of the nations where i sent you and will bring you home again to your own land
5511095 come and see what god has done how awesome his works in mans behalf come and listen all you who fear god let me tell you what he has done for me i cried out to him with my mouth his praise was on my tongue if i had cherished sin in my heart the lord would not have listened but god has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer
5511096 thank god for jesus christ and his power over the darkness
5511097 this is the 21st century its time to get over the idea that witches and pagans have real power its all just fun
5511098 i will set my face against the person who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute himself by following them and i will cut him off from his people
5511099 the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons
5511100 the night is nearly over the day is almost here so let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light let us behave decently as in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and debauchery not in dissension and jealousy rather clothe yourselves with the lord jesus christ and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature
5511101 cursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life it will produce thorns and thistles for you
5511102 by faith we have been made acceptable to god and now because of our lord jesus christ we live at peace with god christ has also introduced us to god s undeserved kindness on which we take our stand so we are happy as we look forward to sharing in the glory of god but that s not all we gladly suffer because we know that suffering helps us to endure and endurance builds character which gives us a hope
5511103 thou movest us to delight in praising thee for thou hast formed us for thyself and our hearts are restless till they find rest in thee
5511104 sin is crouching at the door eager to control you but you must subdue it and be its master
5511105 even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint
5511106 hi im pastor jerry scott and who might you be
5511107 i called you so often but you wouldn t come
5511108 obviously its been really hard you know just the past couple months
5511109 i started running after the accident you know and started just running away from the house and i remember caleb was the first one to run and kind of just jump on me and hold me and then shaoey was right there by him
5511110 to me you know that meant a ton i didnt really want to be at the house i just wanted to be away and i was just freaking out
5511111 ive gotten str a stronger faith through all this you know and more faith through all this but then theres those days you know that just hit you and youre just like oh man this is just awful but you just gotta continue to choose to live and thats the faith that that continues to keep me going you know
5511112 these words i speak to you are not incidental additions to your life homeowner improvements to your standard of living
5511113 but if you just use my words in bible studies and don t work them into your life you are like a stupid carpenter who built his house on the sandy beach when a storm rolled in and the waves came up it collapsed like a house of cards
5511114 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything
5511115 what did i fail to anticipate where did i make a wrong decision what should i have done lord how did this situation come round to me again
5511116 lord i see an opportunity for you to show me again how faithful you are to those who walk humbly with you
5511117 the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way daniel was handling government affairs but they couldn t find anything to criticize or condemn he was faithful always responsible and completely trustworthy
5511118 these jews just wont add our gods to their list of gods they have this idea that their god is the only god so lets get the king to outlaw any form of worship other than emperor worship and well have him
5511119 when daniel learned that the decree had been signed and posted
5511120 daniel 6 10 the message and how does god reward his faithfulness
5511121 when daniel was lifted from the den no wound was found on him because he had trusted in his god
5511122 you can enter god s kingdom only through the narrow gate the highway to hell is broad and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way but the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult and only a few ever find it
5511123 i am pulled between two choices fidelity to my husband and continuing a dangerous flirtation with a man at work
5511124 im not sure i want to do anything about it i like how it feels
5511125 then misuse your power and make these stones into bread
5511126 i give you all the kingdoms of the world if you will fall down and worship me
5511127 since we have a great high priest who has entered heaven jesus the son of god let us hold firmly to what we believe this high priest of ours understands our weaknesses for he faced all of the same testings we do yet he did not sin
5511128 im a terrible person morally defective that i could even think such a thought
5511129 each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed then after desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown gives birth to death
5511130 who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death thank god the answer is in jesus christ our lord so you see how it is in my mind i really want to obey god s law but because of my sinful nature i am a slave to sin
5511131 sing to the lord you saints of his praise his holy name
5511132 hear o lord and be merciful to me o lord be my help
5511133 we believe that anglos portfolio which is more heavily weighted to commercial property is likely to be more vulnerable in a downturn than aib and have increased our impairment charges accordingly
5511134 we have reduced our share price target to 6 on the back of lower earnings estimates and a higher discount rate due to increased economic risk in ireland over the past month anglos share price is up 54 despite newsflow remaining unchanged we continue to believe that earnings risk to the irish banks remains on the downside as the commercial property market slows
5511135 a key message from both anglo irish banks interim management statement and our discussions with management last week is its ability to generate significant levels of capital in a slower loan growth environment
5511136 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this
5511137 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5511138 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5511139 do something really useful for consumers and support ryanairs campaign to prevent consumers being ripped off with hidden mark ups of between 50 to 200 by these unlawful internet ticket tout websites
5511140 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5511141 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5511142 we believe that the offer must be an attempt to squeeze competition in a slowing consumer environment the success of the strategy however is dependent on competitor response
5511143 in the irish market all but one of the top 10 bookies have now matched the offer to varying degrees the exception being william hill meaning that the short term benefits could be limited
5511144 while we believe paddy power will meet and possibly beat our first half 2008 forecasts we also believe there is material risk to consensus estimates particularly for 2009
5511145 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
5511146 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5511147 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
5511148 i have a decent lane i am going to be in with the big boys in the middle and that is right where you want to be what else can i ask for its perfect
5511149 right now i am thinking about my massage and getting to sleep tonight and all that buzzing but trying to keep it under control
5511150 i am competing with them so often that i am not ignored any more and thats a great feeling
5511151 i am absolutely delighted that i got it right that is what i have worked on i have been spouting so much about it that i would have looked stupid if i had messed it up i knew all along i was getting it right and today was proof
5511152 i am very proud of my country but this is all about my hard work for the last 10 years and hopefully it is coming to fruition hopefully tomorrow will be the best day of my life
5511153 to have a stellar aviation brand like british airways select shannon as the stop over airport for this exclusive service is a real vote of confidence in the future of shannon airport
5511154 shannon was selected chiefly because of the length of its runway its trademark commercial refuelling facilities and of course because of its us immigration facilities together these give shannon a competitive advantage over other european airports
5511155 shannon airports ability to complete usa arrival checks during the planned refuelling stop will ensure customers can make the most of their time
5511156 we sat down and said what are we going to do
5511157 i have needs like everyone else im a consumer too
5511158 we brought meaning significance and love it wasnt about money
5511159 many people think because they are economically challenged they cant do anything
5511160 then there are others whose social credibility is defined by what they have
5511161 i still consume as much as always just in a different way
5511162 we were able to change our lifestyle without a lot of pain
5511163 shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter read jer xviii 1 10 power of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor
5511164 hath not the 468potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor
5511165 yeah no i guess not mccain is pretty much all over it
5511166 yeah but who are the least arent the least of these unborn children
5511167 tessera remains committed to protecting its licensees from unfair competition by infringers
5511168 with this settlement and resulting license patriot memory can now offer computer manufacturers and other customers a licensed solution to infringing parts sold by other companies
5511169 complexity in project management and the management of complex projects
5511170 it has been a great learning experience to participate in discussions of project complexity this year
5511171 the global diversity of pmi was quite evident and the consensus points achieved about project complexity significant i am looking forward to the coming activities surrounding the future of project management
5511172 this bill is an affront to the very foundation of democracy and worker privacy
5511173 it frankly is a disingenuous effort and not worthy of the hardworking farm workers it purports to represent
5511174 the ufw does not represent our interests and this bill would give them free reign to bully us
5511175 i dont like the union because they are only concerned with growing membership making money and causing problems the union used to be important but most of us now feel we have enough protections from government and employers
5511176 this would undo 30 years of thoughtful and effective regulation of elections that balances the needs of workers employers and unions
5511177 for all its ramifications it is astounding that this bill only appeared in the final month of the legislatures two year session and will not be vetted in serious public policy committee hearings
5511178 it is all about the ufw exploiting tragedy to tip the election process in their favor because it has failed to deliver value to farm workers
5511179 cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election we are the party that has always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
5511180 we have some cleanup to do and have to finish damage assessments but i believe visitors can return to the keys wednesday
5511181 we asked visitors to leave the keys to ensure their safety
5511182 we hated to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be here but their well being is our top priority
5511183 just a short drive from the beautiful city of san francisco is one of the most scenic and flavorful areas in the country
5511184 a myriad of outdoor activities indulgent spas world class dining and wines art and culture make sonoma the place to live an amazing california lifestyle
5511185 armstrong estates has been a dream of mine i wanted to add to the character of the historic charm of sonoma by extending the historic feel of the town throughout the project and i could only dream that i would be chosen by hgtv to build the 2009 hgtv dream home
5511186 i cant express how exciting it is going to be for me to hopefully shake the hand of the winner
5511187 we are delighted beyond words that an operator of excaliburs quality is opening a 100 pokerpro poker room on the strip it is commentary on how far pokertek and automated poker have come in such a short time
5511188 the acceptance of the game has grown substantially in the last year and continues to grow as our footprint expands
5511189 weve opened a successful 20 plus table room in montreal a beautiful 12 table room in michigan a high end 12 table room in atlantic city and now 12 tables in the gaming hub of the world las vegas with more than 230 pokerpro tables currently installed worldwide we are ready for the nevada market
5511190 ive run poker rooms for 20 years and i cant wait for players to see what excalibur and pokerpro will offer them
5511191 were going to have a great daily tournament schedule tremendous player promotions and more than that well be laying down games that manual rooms just cant for example our pot limit omaha games will be getting out 30 hands per hour that is unheard of for a game as popular as plo and only pokerpro can offer that kind of speed
5511192 i am so excited that automated poker is finally going to exist in vegas
5511193 pokerpro is an amazing way to play the game the speed and accuracy beats any manual table you will find me in the excaliburs poker room from time to time and i challenge all poker players to try this
5511194 we did that so people would know it wasnt a golf cart
5511195 this could be one of the key steps involved so were not so reliant on foreign oil
5511196 is an application which was downloaded from the internet are you sure you want to open it
5511197 i wish i could filters out all the fluff from twitter and get the things i wanna know about
5511198 i cant believe it ive let so many chances slip through my hands before
5511199 he walked across the street and we immediately thought that he was a troubled man
5511200 we were suspicious about him so we were like ok well you know stay calm dont make eye contact with him
5511201 he turned around suddenly and emily turned around to look at me
5511202 and then i saw him with the knife like about to lunge into her
5511203 and then we both screamed at the top of our lungs like bloody murder
5511204 it was so weird it was like nothing had happened he just walked away
5511205 when i fell to the floor and i pulled my hand away and there was blood on my hand they instantly came running to me
5511206 assault with a deadly weapon different assaults one including an assault on a peace officer
5511207 this should have never happened its sunday morning at 11 oclock in the morning
5511208 i want him to go to jail i dont think that he should be able to have the chance to do anything like this again
5511209 please buy this product only if you meet the prerequisites if the shoes do not fit we cant be responsible if they hurt your feet
5511210 looking ahead to a period of forecast economic uncertainty advertisers can continue to invest confidently in online advertising knowing that their target audience is spending more of their time online and that online advertising offers a cost effective platform to reach and engage that audience
5511211 sweden will get there this year and the uk is probably going to be next in the following year
5511212 when we talk about internet advertising we are talking about a mix which includes search display and classified advertising
5511213 eighteen months ago you could have managed to get away without building online into your advertising and marketing strategy but if youre the manager youd probably get fired now it cannot be ignored
5511214 the internet appeals to consumers in a way that tv does not over the past 50 years advertisers have learnt how to shout down to people but the internet offers interactivity unlike tv the little red button on television remote controls for example was more of a red herring than anything else you press it you get a longer advert and your tv experience is interrupted that does not happen online where interactivity adds value to the user experience thats quite important in winning the attention of your customers
5511215 this kind of milestone when internet overtakes tv will really bring it home to the industry that this is a medium to be reckoned with
5511216 looking ahead i think advertisers will start using high rates of broadband usage to grow other parts of the mix search will remain important but it will probably grow at a slower rate than the other components of the online media mix as advertisers exploit other areas for example they may use more video ads on websites as more people switch to a higher bandwidth
5511217 so if youre such a marketing expert and you help people attract all the clients they need what are you doing here at a networking group each week
5511218 if youre so good why are you so available let alone chasing business
5511219 i market consistently because i know that if you dont market consistently you dont always have clients even when i have a waiting list of people waiting to work with me i still dont stop marketing id be foolish to do that
5511220 two clients recently graduated so i have openings for just two new clients
5511221 i have decided to take on more clients because tell the truth
5511222 urgent meeting 9 30 a m in the board room
5511223 what should we do when they are offering it free
5511224 instead of wasting their time demanding rights and privileges from the united states it was time to go home he said and fight the battle for fairness dignity and economic justice where it might do some good on mexican soil
5511225 you son just asked when he could start doing the work of a real man
5511226 they told me im going to significantly play this year it depends on how the packages go each week other than that im pretty excited for jordan hes been through a lot and hopefully he does a good job with it
5511227 i was laid back with it i wasnt anxious or nervous or anything like that i didnt anticipate it i didnt have any anticipation of who was going to be the starter jordan got the job and im happy for him whatever i can do to help this team win thats what im going to do
5511228 im just happy to get on the field and show what i can do
5511229 portis portis i hate you why are you making me run in practice but you dont know who youre going come against out there during the season
5511230 the eyes of the world are on guantanamo bay justice must be done there and must be seen to be done there fairly and impartially
5511231 im sorry theyre out of the coolers and it took a while did you get the prescriptions
5511232 no i didnt i dont know what youre picking up
5511233 daddy all you need to do is give them our name theyll find them

5511235 richard i dont want to have a d s or tpe or whatever relationship anymore
5511236 well why should you trust me you dont know yet if i can do it do you i have to earn your trust on this
5511237 we really had to open up our minds as to what this could mean for us and the city of denver
5511238 recently ed gave the word that were getting rid of junk food around here so we replaced it with this stuff so far most people like it more
5511239 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the us and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5511240 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5511241 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5511242 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5511243 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5511244 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5511245 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5511246 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the us
5511247 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5511248 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5511249 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5511250 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5511251 looking through the categories i note that while there is christian rock country and rap contemporary christian pop and pop and urban gospel there is no category for atheist music can i ask you initially to create atheist rock as a sub genre of rock this is the category that most of my recent and current music writing falls into
5511252 at this time there has not been enough requests for this genre to be added so we will not be adding it thank you for your suggestion though
5511253 i dont need no heaven i dont need religion i am in the place where i should be
5511254 if you open your mind too far your brain will fall out
5511255 you know you cant call it sohah nobody will understand you say soho
5511256 no no its soho never mind youll get it eventually just keep on practising
5511257 the current council has some issues that are ahead of them
5511258 i bet marc is playing in the baseball field while the wind gently wispers your poem in his ear
5511259 here we are at the zoo and heres the picture that was supposed to be a surprise at the very end oh this sucks i dont want to talk anymore i really just dont want to talk about these things

5511262 were looking beyond the chess game inside the beltway to what the real needs of people are
5511263 dont allow unlicensed personal and portable devices to operate in the white spaces of the television spectrum
5511264 americans deserve and expect to have interference free digital tv
5511265 we have a clear business interest in this along with our business peers
5511266 this is an open platform for people to make their voices heard and the fcc has shown they will take note of that
5511267 for truly it is to be noted that childrens plays are not sports and should be deemed as their most serious actions
5511268 little girls are cute and small only to adults to one another they are not cute they are life sized
5511269 i thought we were getting bought out a newly hired sales rep recalled
5511270 basically we all felt betrayed said john wade a sales support engineer who had joined agami only two weeks earlier passing on two other job offers
5511271 you dont raise 45 million and then get shut down that doesnt make sense said dan warmenhoven ceo of netapp one of the big companies agami aimed to challenge
5511272 agamis board has decided to shut the company down as the efforts to raise further capital didnt materialize in time
5511273 the company is going through a process of the liquidation of assets so i dont have anymore details than that
5511274 change the world technology across a wide region he said he was impressed that agami was backed by kleiner perkins as well as by stiles previous successes at other start ups that had since merged into redback networks and cisco systems
5511275 he was wiping out our phones as we were sitting there wade said
5511276 we had a customer the other day calling for parts and they didnt know we shut down
5511277 first us internet ad spending surpassed 5 billion in q2 2007 the largest sum recorded in any quarter according to research from the
5511278 second while 69 of the 100 largest us advertisers put smaller budget shares into four traditional media television radio newspapers and magazines in 2006 than the previous year 70 of the same group put larger shares into internet advertising
5511279 third even as the credit crunch pulls ad money off the total media table the internet looks to be more resistant to economic turmoil
5511280 to put the obvious into figures online advertising contributes more and more to the total ad spending universe every year
5511281 data from both emarketer and indicate that 2007 internet ad spending will be higher than for radio as reported in august that is the first time online ad spending will be greater than for any of the four traditional measured media

5511288 im happy with how the test went today because i improved my lap times from yesterdays race
5511289 we worked mainly on the setting today with the objective of finding the right balance for the bike
5511290 over the weekend we only really had two hours to get to know the bike so this morning we tried a few different solutions with the rear and once we were happy with the base setting we tested a few tyres and decided which was the best way to go
5511291 from here onwards i think we can give bridgestone the right information to develop tyres for this bike
5511292 tomorrow we have another day to test gather data and hopefully make some more improvements
5511293 it was a good day of testing today after a great day of racing yesterday
5511294 we have tested many different bridgestone tyres both front and rear and we have collected a lot of information which will help us for the rest of the season
5511295 then we worked on some new electronics and mapping but we need to continue with this tomorrow because we havent finished the whole programme
5511296 tomorrow we also have some general set up work to do to try some things that we werent able to check at the weekend due to losing one day to rain
5511297 we hope that we will have another good day tomorrow finish all of our planned work and then we will leave here in good shape for the final push
5511298 we tried some different front tyres that michelin brought here for this test but we finished after some laps because we couldnt find any improvement
5511299 we tested the tyres with my current valve spring race bike there was no point using the machine with the pneumatic valve engine because the tyres werent working well enough
5511300 we have rescheduled this test at misano on the monday after the san marino gp
5511301 today we tested some new steps in development concerning both engine and electronics in japan we are working on the development of both the spring valve engine and the pneumatic valve engine
5511302 today was a day mainly focused on research for a better performance from our rubber we have noted some progress but this is still not enough we expect michelin to work intensively to achieve the results we expect for the next race
5511303 colin edwards has got a good lap time but only for three laps which is not significant enough for us to draw any conclusions
5511304 we stayed out even longer to assess the durability of the tyres in addition to grip

5511328 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5511329 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5511330 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5511331 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned

5511341 i think a lot of guys kind of relax when they get their money
5511342 theyre like i got my money maybe i dont have to be as hungry my mind set is to work just as hard as i always have if not harder every day to prove myself

5511346 the survey paints a stark picture of the challenging business environment that has emerged in the uk over the past year with the economy facing its most difficult period since the early 1990s this is now compounded by high and uncertain oil and commodity prices creating inflationary pressures and fall out from the uk housing market downturn which has continued to gather pace at the same time we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year

5511350 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
5511351 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
5511352 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
5511353 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
5511354 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
5511355 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
5511356 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
5511357 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
5511358 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
5511359 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
5511360 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

5511364 we played each other twice a year because we were in the same conference and you didnt want to lose the first game with them because that put you into a hole
5511365 that would mean you had to pick up a game on them somewhere in the course of the rest of the season and then beat them in the second game to have a chance to win the title
5511366 many times we got that help from pittsburgh the steelers were terrible then but they were able to beat the giants wed beat pittsburgh pretty handily and have trouble with the giants and then wed watch pittsburgh beat the giants and wonder how all that happened
5511367 now if you lost twice to the giants then forget it you had almost no chance to win the conference
5511368 there were a couple years in a row when the giants slipped a little and we were beating them pretty regularly
5511369 one of their coaches asked me one time bob whats wrong with our team i told them your linemen are too small i played at 270 pounds and the giants had guys who were 220 225 guys at that size cant do much consistently against a guy whos 270
5511370 so you know what happened the giants started drafting bigger players and their team improved
5511371 the one year 1957 we opened against them no one scored a touchdown it was all field goals
5511372 against the giants one season i kept running over their center and getting into the backfield
5511373 i got over to the sideline one time and blanton collier browns head coach came over and asked me bob whats going on between you and their center you look like youre talking to him during the play

5511385 google is known for innovation not only in the way they run their company but also in their applications and people seem to like some of the other services they have better than what yahoo and the others have
5511386 from a business perspective probably the most important metric you can have is whether you are satisfying your customers
5511387 because satisfied customers are going to be more loyal and recommend the service to other people
5511388 most of the services that google offers today they offered a year ago
5511389 because of the word of mouth factor there is a delay that happens between an innovation being launched and the average person understanding it

5511443 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
5511444 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
5511445 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
5511446 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
5511447 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
5511448 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

5511752 pu un signore permettere a qualcuno chiunque egli sia di ingerirsi nel destino dei propri servi
5511753 pu farlo solo qualora egli voglia recedere dal proprio diritto di possedere quei servi
5511754 questo dice la sacra torah e questo dicono i nostri saggi e quanti insegnano la legge io sono venuto qui da te in quanto latore di una querela contro questo signore e perch esigo che le sue azioni vengano giudicate come ha potuto consentire iddio che uno zar di questo mondo abbia per proprio capriccio scacciato dalle consuete residenze un intero popolo e lo abbia cos condannato a subire calamit e sofferenze
5511755 come possiamo noi creature di questa terra costringere a una risposta il creatore del mondo
5511756 ma non sarebbe allora pi ragionevole giudicare lo zar di questo mondo
5511757 la tua intenzione di citare davanti al din toyre il signore iddio in persona audace se non arrogante ma in considerazione del fatto che tale atto stato sollecitato non da egoismo o da ambizione bens da grande amore per il popolo e da compassione per le sue sofferenze e per le calamit cui fatto oggetto tenendo conto del tuo altruismo e del tuo disprezzo per il pericolo cui stai sottomettendo la tua vita e la tua anima io umile servo di dio posso anche dichiararmi pronto ad azzardarmi a citare dio in giudizio ma solo se in qualit di giudice io sia affiancato da un collegio formato da giudici che non consentiranno alla decisione del tribunale di deviare dalla verit
5511758 chi siamo e cosa siamo noi per giudicare se siano improntate o meno a giustizia le azioni del creatore
5511759 la torah non forse opera sua egli quindi la personificazione della giustizia
5511760 fin da quando il signore ci ha dato la sua torah essa appartiene a noi e non a dio e noi non solo abbiamo il diritto bens il dovere di commisurare sulle sue leggi tutto ci che viene compiuto nel mondo abbiamo il dovere di smascherare tutti coloro che agiscono contro la torah senza guardare in faccia nessuno mi avete sentito
5511761 noi siamo pronti in nome della giustizia imposta a noi uomini noi siamo pronti a esprimere un giudizio circa la giustizia delle azioni dellaltissimo
5511762 qui presente il querelante che ha intentato unazione legale contro laltissimo
5511763 qui presente il querelato ed egli pronto a rispondere davanti a un tribunale composto di uomini ed egli disposto a impegnarsi ad adempiere a quanto sar deciso da questo tribunale
5511764 querelante su cosa si basa la querela contro dio e cos che vuoi
5511765 perci io a nome di tutto il popolo definisco le azioni di dio una evidente ingiustizia in contrasto con le leggi consolidate e fondo la mia accusa in considerazione di quanto esposto nei libri sacri seguenti ai capitoli seguenti nonch alle pagine seguenti traendo fondamento da tutto ci io esigo che la funesta gzeyra sia revocata
5511766 querelato la legge ci impone di ascoltare anche laltra parte a te dunque la parola parla
5511767 la maggior parte del mio popolo si impantanata nei peccati io sono il dio della vendetta e quindi io esercito questa vendetta non dato a un mortale abrogare una mia volont
5511768 ii tribunale si ritira per pensare e per formulare una decisione
5511769 in considerazione dunque di tutte queste cose e accusando dio di ingiustizia noi tribunale di uomini basandoci su leggi divine e umane esigiamo che questa funestissima gzeyra sia da dio revocata

5511776 websites simply must increase their due diligence checks with any new advertiser
5511777 it is going to take time and it is going to cost money but what alternative do websites have if they want to protect and keep their readership and if they want to avoid the inevitable end result of malvertizing which is that more and more visitors to their sites are going to block all advertising

5511831 the important thing that i have to do and maybe even the people around me is to separate whats happened this year because its a different organization a different group of players
5511832 i look forward to what san jose has to offer its an exciting hockey club they won 49 games this last year you dont do that by mistake they were well coached they had a great team but theres just something there thats holding them back from getting over the top as a coach and a coaching staff and the players we all have a responsibility to solve that problem if we can do that we will have our exciting moments if we dont then we have to go back to the drawing board and keep plugging away until it happens
5511833 weve waited a long time to win it we can wait an extra hour to celebrate with it
5511834 going to city hall with the cup we pulled around the corner and had no where to park
5511835 i thought for sure don saskatoon mayor atchison a former coach of mclellans would have a spot reserved not necessarily for todd mclellan but for stanley and he failed he must be really busy
5511836 so i thought we should park in the bus stop which was a no no a very nice gentleman in a fine commissionaires uniform started to write a couple of tickets i looked over my shoulder and he was writing the tickets and i thought oh no here we go were going to have to pay that a few minutes later the same gentleman was taking a picture with stanley and i so it was a really unique situation
5511837 its exciting to see the blade crew with the brodsky family owners of the blades who treated me like gold obviously daryl lubienecki mclellans g m and coach with the blades and the rest of the crew there im very thankful to them to give me an opportunity to play junior at home first of all and then secondly to spend the full four years here it was very rewarding and i learned a lot about not only being a hockey person or player but also about being a young man they do a tremendous job with that so they should be very proud of their organization a big part of the community
5511838 bob shepherd gave me an opportunity to coach in north battleford in the saskatchewan junior league at 24 years old and im not sure a lot of people wouldve taken that chance but i was fortunate enough that he did two years later the swift current broncos organization led by the late doug mosher at that time gave me a chance to be a coach in the western hockey league at 26 im very grateful to the communities to the people who supported me there to the players who have come through ive always had a good relationship with the players and to come back and see them and find out that theyre married or they have children or theyre doing this or that is very rewarding for me

5511877 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
5511878 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
5511879 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
5511880 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
5511881 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
5511882 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
5511883 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
5511884 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
5511885 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

5511896 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5511897 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5511898 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5511899 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5511905 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5511906 its expensive to bring the food in its high rent

5511917 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5511918 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5511919 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5511920 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey

5511990 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5511991 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5511992 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5511993 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5511994 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5512001 it sounded like a clap of thunder and then i saw the coach flying through the air into the garden
5512002 i immediately dialled 999 and grabbed a lot of towels and took them out to the people outside
5512003 there were lots of wounded people in the garden some were lying on the ground bleeding it was horrible
5512004 the bus stopped about 20 ft away from my home it happened so quickly
5512005 the weather was pretty horrendous it was chucking it down there were people screaming and covered in blood it was like a war scene the bus has propelled the four ton wagon over 30 yards so it must have been going at some speed
5512006 people were screaming they were foreign and were struggling to communicate my brother supported the head of a lady who had a suspected spinal injury everyone was covered in blood and there was glass everywhere the bus is crushed to the extent it is probably half the height it was
5512007 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5512008 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english
5512009 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane

5512016 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5512017 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5512018 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5512019 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5512020 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5512021 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5512028 my job as an investigative reporter is to pursue issues that i think are true or merit investigation and report the findings as i find them

5512030 what motivated the book started with the fact that obama was generally unknown to the public
5512031 he is probably the least vetted presidential candidate weve had in modern times
5512032 become so enamored with barack obama that it has neglected to do the traditional investigative journalist duty which is to investigate critically
5512033 all critical evaluation of obama was not only dropped but those who opposed obama were daring to go do that knowing theyd be abused like i have
5512034 since the time of aristotle ad hominem attacks have been considered fallacious arguments in debate
5512035 the campaign is doing to me what they charge me as doing to them
5512036 world net daily where i am a staff reporter our editorial discipline is that we state our convictions we openly write editorials and commentary as well as do news analysis
5512037 i make it clear that i am opposed to obamas candidacy and lay out the reasons why what i expect is that the public will read that and make up their own minds
5512038 threshold is a small line publishing books and authors on the conservative continuum from libertarian to religious to intellectual to historical

5512050 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5512051 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5512052 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5512053 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5512054 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5512077 he was a batsman in top form but thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5512078 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that
5512079 it took us a bit long to figure out the two guys out

5512090 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5512091 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5512092 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5512093 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5512094 now some of the poorest countries in africa which border the river nile cooperate on managing the water resources in turn contributing to peace and stability economic growth and tackling climate change this is a result of recognising a common not conflicting resource
5512095 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5512096 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5512152 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5512153 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5512154 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5512155 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5512156 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5512175 at times like that you need people around you who have experienced something similar who can not only sympathise but can empathise
5512176 ive no doubt that there are people here who are going through periods of grief or mourning
5512177 yes theres a time to hear that and a time to respond to it but we have to mourn we have to grieve its a very basic human thing to do we literally need a shoulder to cry on someone to support us and stand by us someone who has been there who has passed through that door as well

5512185 while fewer people visited country week than we anticipated our prime location at the entrance to the expo together with dynamic visual displays and thorough information ensured we were able to entice most visitors to our booth
5512186 we offered each of these people a comprehensive package of information which included a shire overview employment listings and agency contacts real estate listings visitor information as well as great offers and incentives aimed at enticing them to bring their family for a visit to forbes
5512187 it proved compelling telling visitors about the recent signs of economic development in forbes including attraction of two new industries superbee honey factory and powered by nature progress of the public private partnership to deliver stage two of the central west livestock exchange and development of a walk in walk out medical centre
5512188 this was an opportunity to showcase both the economic and lifestyle benefits we are afforded here
5512189 it is wonderful that we can take a world event like the olympics and paralympics and use it to motivate children to get active and encourage fair play and teamwork
5512190 the olympic and paralympic games inspire people of all backgrounds
5512191 it captivates childrens imagination by watching thinking and talking about sport and motivates them to get out there and be active
5512192 both alcohol and pornography have already had a devastating effect on the moral character of the nation and will continue to do so for some time

5512235 my desire to play in the ryder cup is greater than ever as i have shown in the past and in my schedule which has been geared towards qualifying but i want now to work on my game to compete as well as i can in scotland and to have my game to a standard that would allow me hopefully to perform at a level to help the team if i am part of it to the requisite 14 and a half points
5512236 after these few days with my wife and family i am ready to get down to some serious hard work at gleneagles which is no more than 10 minutes from home so some long hours can easily be put in
5512237 hopefully the crowds will inspire me to a great week it will be a really strong tournament with so many european players in the field battling to improve their positions on the european ryder cup rankings in the final qualifying event
5512238 i think the spectators are in for a great week weather permitting
5512239 i was delighted and impressed with padraigs performance and hes going to bring something very special to the team
5512240 having the only current major champion at the ryder cup will add significant weight to our campaign

5512477 with such a high volume and such a fast paced environment it is understandable that mistakes could happen

5512483 en la serie usamos el mayor n mero posible de an lisis t cnicos para mantener al p blico interesado verificamos que esas t cnicas son aceptadas y empleadas por peritos reales antes de hacerlas aparecer en la serie
5512484 al comienzo iba las fiestas y preguntaba a mis amigos doctores contadme los casos m dicos m s raros que hay is visto
5512485 yo quiero que todo m dico y hasta un experto en determinada rea pueda ver la serie y decir uau s eso podr a suceder
5512486 los casos de la serie son un conglomerado de todas las peores cosas que pueden pasarle a las personas de todo el mundo s lo que restringidos a una peque a comunidad
5512487 tras a os y a os trabajando como enfermera ya vi todo tipo de operaciones y es impresionante el grado de precisi n con que son reproducidas en una escena traigo m dicos y enfermeras para trabajar en el set conmigo y ellos apenas consiguen creer lo realista que es todo
5512488 si algo no fuera cre ble yo voy y apunto coopero con todos los departamentos trabajo con los guionistas creando las historias y entonces trabajo con los directores y actores mapeando las escenas intentando dar veracidad a las secuencias a la hora de grabar es eso lo que amo de mi trabajo
5512489 antes de la grabaci n de los episodios cuando recibimos la programaci n de las filmaciones recibimos tambi n una hoja con los t rminos m dicos abordados sus pronunciaciones correctas y lo que significan
5512490 elaboro ideas de c lculos y t cnicas y todo aquello que se lee en pizarra de eppes es matem tica real
5512491 apoyo cient fico en lo que los personajes dicen hacen y piensan
5512492 los productores pensaron que krumholtz tendr a dificultades en escribir las complejas expresiones num ricas y mi mano se parece a la de l
5512493 a veces en una elecci n entre drama y comedia o completa autenticidad la autenticidad pierde por ejemplo una vez un gui n hablaba de bacterias vaginales en la boca de un personaje y yo escrib a los productores diciendo que no s lo esa enfermedad no se da en la boca sino que la terminolog a estaba equivocada pues si crece en la boca no puede ser vaginal y ellos dijeron genial pero de la forma en la que lo hemos escrito es m s graciosa perd batalla cient fica por el humor y fue divertido

5512504 esta noche vamos a tomar el control de cemex como tomamos el control de la faja con los trabajadores
5512505 la cantidad que est n pidiendo cemex por la planta esta por encima de su valor real por encima de los 1300 millones de d lares estamos adquiriendo la misma capacidad de cemex por 819 millones de d lares y con una tecnolog a con plantas de mejor conservaci n y tratamiento ambiental
5512506 cemex tiene problemas ambientales espacio de tecnolog a y eso nos dice que no puede ser un valor muy por encima de lo que estamos negociando hoy d a con lafarge y holcim porque se est adquiriendo la misma capacidad de producci n
5512507 nos sentimos muy contentos de haber llegaron a un acuerdo
5512508 ni el pa s ni el sector de la salud est n en condiciones de incorporar estos tratamientos y cirug as como el cintur n g strico que no se cubre en ning n lugar del mundo
5512509 la ley profundiza los desequilibrios porque relega una vez m s a 16 millones de argentinos sin cobertura m dica que deben atenderse con escasez de insumos y aparatolog a obsoleta en un hospital p blico colapsado
5512510 al aumento de precios del material descartable se agrega la elevada incidencia de las nuevas tecnolog as los costos que desencadenan los juicios por mala praxis y la medicina defensiva y la ampliaci n permanente del programa m dico obligatorio pmo configurando una situaci n altamente deficitaria para el sector

5512513 la intervenci n tiene un costo de alrededor de 10 000 d lares y ser a necesaria para alrededor de un 20 por ciento de los obesos m rbidos
5512514 en el pa s no hay datos confiables de lo que se invierte en el tratamiento de la obesidad
5512515 las obras sociales y las prepagas s lo pueden determinar que el impacto ser sumamente costoso si aumentan la cuotas los tratamientos ser n absorbidos por todos los afiliados

5512541 there is never a wrong time to do the right thing
5512542 i want to emphasize that this is all part of a campaign to distract the attention of the american people from the real energy crisis which is facing us by talking endlessly about drilling for oil in tiny protected areas of our country when senator mccain knows that we will not see a drop of oil from offshore drilling for eight to ten years
5512543 senator mccain by his trip tomorrow will hope that we forget that he opposes immediate relief for consumers like senator barack obamas one thousand dollar energy credit which is going to be paid for by a windfall profits tax on oil companies and senator mccain hopes that we wont notice that it was the bush cheney mccain energy policy of the last several years that has increased gas prices from 1 89 when bill clinton left office to over four dollars today
5512544 and instead of looking ahead to real and to new solutions senator mccain is looking back once again to fellow washington insiders like the 33 former oil and gas lobbyists who are advising him and fundraising for his campaign and he simply wants to continue the policies of president bush over the last seven and a half years which have failed miserably to help us begin to become energy independent and to begin to reduce the price of oil and the price of gasoline for consumers
5512545 so the american people i hope will begin to understand this as just a gimmick as they understood that the federal gas tax holiday was a gimmick senator mccain is not going to solve our energy crisis because frankly he helped create it
5512546 in short we found an indonesian politician who helped plan the attack on two american school teachers in 2002
5512547 this has been widely reported in the news that the indonesian military was involved but were really the first to identify the probable field agent who actually set up the operation
5512548 one requirement to be on the list of terrorist organisations is to kill americans
5512549 in short it looks like they were setting up papuan guerillas to be on that list to try to get them labelled as a terrorist organisation
5512550 clearly those officials have misled the american public and the world at large
5512551 they had confessions extracted out of them after the fbi detained them and handed them to indonesian authorities
5512552 the real flaw with that trial is the failure of them to take any evidence of indonesian military involvement seriously
5512553 you say you cared about people yet you didnt even try to tell them about my sacrifice for their sake
5512554 that messenger on the internet oh yes his interview is next week the televangelist he may be a hypocrite but thats not your concern he will answer to me if he was now im asking you why you rejected my sacrifice
5512555 i want to demonstrate in favor of preserving beijings historic architecture
5512556 do you think the government is not doing a good job at this
5512557 if i go through all this then will my application at least be granted
5512558 we cant answer that for that matter has no connection to this case

5512594 universities and other research organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of open access publishing and this program will enable them to take an active role in moving from a subscription based publication system to a system based on open access

5512614 now the old king is dead long live the king

5512619 we have to be realistic its one company so the openness has its limits
5512620 its easier to sell business objects to sap than to sell sap to business objects
5512621 the good news is at least for the first half of the year we are seen as an open and agnostic solution set
5512622 we feel we may have lost customers in the past because we may not have had the right solution weve got the right solution today

5512626 it is a lot of work to go through them and turn them around people need to get more training and come up with business plans that are fundable
5512627 it is true some of our most innovative engineering students do not know how to write business plans capable of being funded but that is also a challenge among established business people

5512635 i get asked did you want to give up acting the thing is i didnt get well known until 14 or 15 years into my acting career

5512651 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature this might be a good time to take another look
5512652 while take two went on to release its latest gta game to blockbuster sales steeling its resistance to what it considered a low ball bid but wait theres more
5512653 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5512654 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5512655 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5512656 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5512657 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5512658 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5512659 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5512660 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5512661 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5512662 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5512663 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5512664 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5512665 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5512666 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5512667 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5512668 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5512669 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5512670 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5512671 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5512672 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5512673 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5512674 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5512675 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5512676 try making it to the actual top this time old man
5512677 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5512678 our goal was to keep those cuts as far away from the classroom as possible
5512679 what if fuel should go up by a quarter in a period of a month or two
5512680 we might have to have some emergency response to that
5512681 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5512682 i dont really like it because it takes like 20 minutes to do it
5512683 when its a panic call theyre not thinking it through in that way
5512684 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5512685 he confessed to it all said that it was just a joke just a prank
5512686 the commonwealth attorney and the investigator felt that due to the fear instilled through these cards that would be the appropriate charge
5512687 it was a joke a practical joke that got out of hand
5512688 this batman movie this is where him and his buddy got the idea about the cards
5512689 but down here we had this virginia tech thing the april 2007 massacre in which 32 people were killed by a gunman so people are already on edge the local police went overboard with this terrorism thats ridiculous you know how teenagers are
5512690 bryan was upset he was praying and kneeling down on the floor hes a religious type boy
5512691 ok do you want us to come over and shoot her
5512692 unfortunately in the whole public safety spectrum training is usually the first thing cut from the budget when dollars need to be crunched
5512693 were seeing lots of cutbacks in most states and that has impacted public safety some of these recent mistakes could be attributable to lack of training high turnover and the inability to retain workers getting low wages and operators who are overworked and exhausted
5512694 911 operators are governed at the lowest levels of government not even at the municipality level but on the agency level whether its local police or fire departments
5512695 of course people were making mistakes and falling asleep on the job some of us were working around the clock working on the holidays working overtime to make extra money its a high stress job and were only human
5512696 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5512697 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5512698 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days

5512737 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of s closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5512738 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5512747 drilling for oil is a crucial component of a and i strongly support it
5512748 there are a lot of games being played here with the democratic majority they refuse to actually drill here drill now and pay less for gasoline at this point theyre standing in the way

5512779 not discriminating against people and doctors not playing the role of god saying because you are gay you are not worthy of having a child or a family
5512780 i did it not only for me my partner and my children but for other people coming after me so they dont have to go through the humiliation and frustration and abandonment as a patient
5512781 you cant opt out of the law because of your religious beliefs
5512782 the laws have been in place for a long time a business cant exclude you because you are gay
5512783 but they cant pick and choose on the medically irrelevant characteristics of the patient

5512812 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
5512813 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
5512814 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
5512815 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
5512816 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
5512817 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
5512818 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
5512819 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
5512820 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
5512821 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
5512822 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

5512837 its really exciting to see the strong response weve received from the veterans community
5512838 but its not just veterans who care about these issues or about honesty in government people are disgusted by the way our government has broken its promises with our veterans who have put their lives on the line for us thats why so many veterans who know the truth about steve buyers record of anti veteran votes and his history of saying one thing and doing the opposite are pitching in to help our campaign and to help me fight for our veterans
5512839 veterans need a strong voice in washington someone who will put them first nels ackerson will fight for our vets and protect their benefits
5512840 treating our veterans fairly is not about party it is about principle we need to fight steve buyers anti veteran legislation such as his proposed veterans tax im running a bipartisan campaign that includes supporters from both parties who understand that we need to find solutions not scapegoats
5512841 ranted insults at disabled veterans as if we were a bunch of errant children
5512842 veterans for ackerson represents a first step to ensuring that the veterans in this district have an honest advocate in congress who does what he says and who fights for veterans and not against them
5512843 our veterans and all of us deserve a representative we can trust and who will not claim to support veterans issues and then vote against those same issues in washington i deeply respect the noble service our veterans provide to this country and i am honored to have them supporting my campaign
5512844 absolutely 100 per cent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5512845 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5512846 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5512847 i am completely cut off from information inside the health department
5512848 i dont know what the new minister is going to decide over the next few years but i do have a deep understanding of health systems across the country
5512849 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5512850 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5512851 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5512852 in this way the supervised injection site undercuts the ethics of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its ok to allow someone to overdose under their care
5512853 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5512854 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5512855 its clear that this was being used as a political issue
5512856 i found the use of medical ethics to justify a political decision which will affect social policy to be troubling at best and misleading at worst
5512857 ethics consist of a balancing of rights and harms as do all medical decisions that physicians in this room help their patients reach every day iv drug users as the rest of us have the right to compassion and to access and care which has proven to be beneficial
5512858 there is not enough evidence for who to provide global guidance to member states on safe injection facilities
5512859 we have to do more to reach out to our own sons and daughters who are overdosing in the downtown eastside
5512860 they need our compassion and they need our intervention not help simply to shoot up
5512861 we know that if people have a safe place that they can talk to people that they eventually will come off drugs they eventually will get help and that they dont die

5512866 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
5512867 i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character fuck dc comics
5512868 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5512869 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5512870 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5512871 it must have dropped about 20 feet it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5512872 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5512873 its an extremely dangerous road its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off
5512874 i heard what sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5512875 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker bus it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and rolled over
5512876 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one to university hospital of north staffordshire twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital
5512877 some people may have found her near perfect 2006 album over the mountain across the valley and back to the stars matador because of its guest starsjames mcnew of yo la tengo and britt daniel of spoon oconnor would be just fine without them
5512878 oconnor beautifully mines the tough terrain created by the twin demons of love and death
5512879 sure it might sound like a no brainer but theres a fine art to being plainspoken and eschewing metaphor and florid prose while still having something meaningful and original to say amp ldots otherwise you end up sounding like reo speedwagon ill opt for jennifer oconnor instead this new york indie folk rocker has made herself the envy of nearly every other confessional singer songwriter out there thanks to the genuinely affecting ruminations on love and loss of last years over the mountain across the valley and back to the stars matador offering an invitingly elemental production that focuses on the bumps and bruises of oconnors slightly world weary voice the album is riveting in its quietly devastating candor

5512885 the information we have received is that she has been taken out of beijing
5512886 its natural and normal for the attention to be on the athletes themselves at the moment
5512887 at the same time its safe to say theres been less press attention to human rights since bush left beijing major news outlets are not covering these issues in the way we would like them to
5512888 the chinese government has cleaned up just about everything in the city
5512889 its hard for journalists who are there for just a couple of weeks to find something authentic
5512890 the international media only have so much access they can either interview individually if they can or they pick up clues from what is in the chinese internet or the chinese media
5512891 caijing is always trying to push the envelope a little further but there is only limited space that they can do so
5512892 the chinese internet is getting censored to the point that nothing is getting reported
5512893 of course china is fundamentally different from most olympic hosts its human rights deprivations are legion and it doesnt have a free media
5512894 but theres also a certain pattern to olympic games the run up to any olympic games often draws a lot of protest groups and the general pattern is once the games begin these sort of things begin to fade
5512895 the olympics is a big show people want to know whats going on in the games and might be less interested in another miserable story about human rights in china
5512896 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
5512897 of course we love the attention were not going to have a wet t shirt contest or anything on friday nights but hey she can keep talking about us all she wants
5512898 were glad shes a fan we think weve got a pretty good thing going here and were glad shes telling the world about us
5512899 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them
5512900 so why is the number 8 considered lucky in the minds of chinese people

5512938 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5512939 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5512940 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away

5512943 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5512944 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
5512945 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear
5512946 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5512947 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5512948 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5512949 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh

5512953 jens background in developing and producing reality programming is incredibly diverse her relationships in the creative community run very deep
5512954 my decision to join granada america last december was based in large part on the opportunity to work with this team who have been the cornerstone of granada americas growth
5512955 one of them doesnt ride so im actually picking up one student most of the time
5512956 were very committed to making sure that all of our bus routes are efficient
5512957 now that youve brought that particular situation to my attention well be looking at that today to see if theres something we can change today to fix that
5512958 those are the kinds of situations were absolutely targeting and thinking about
5512959 understanding that some sacrifices have to be made to be able to provide transportation for a full 180 days
5512960 wake county has had the 3 10ths and 5 10ths of a mile id say going on at least 10 years
5512961 it pulled at least 95 percent of all of our buses out of cul de sacs
5512962 we try to create no more than five stops along a run four is better fewer the better
5512963 what really makes our stuff different than the typical animation you see out there is our characters instead of telling a story theyre playing a piece of music so instead of dialogue their hands or little moving parts are playing music
5512964 dave is more of the hardcore trained artist and my background is much more in music and in computers and animation
5512965 i write a lot of the software that we use to drive all of this partially because you cant just buy off the shelf software that you plug music into and animation comes up its not the way stuff is usually done
5512966 we can start an animation from any number of angles
5512967 you could start literally writing all the music first and then deciding what the instruments look like weve done that before we could actually design a whole instrument without figuring out any music for it to play until its done and weve done that as well or the ideal way to do it is where youre co developing the music and the instruments together
5512968 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5512969 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5512970 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5512971 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5512972 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5512973 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5512974 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5512975 streaking twins will have to just show up to earn win against as
5512976 this guy girl hit on me i said i was straight but not narrow and it was totally chill
5512977 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5512978 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5512979 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5512980 everybody who visited it who knew the first thing about history thought it was a joke
5512981 its always a good feeling when people want to acknowledge you
5512982 they kind of know who you are its been fun out here
5512983 last year it was rainy and some of the games got canceled
5512984 to be able to come out this year and see the games take place its been fun it kind of reminds me of what it was like when i was 12 13 years old
5512985 basically i told them just go out there and have fun
5512986 id be kind of like why are they watching us theyre big leaguers i mean were fans were in the clubhouse watching the games
5512987 hopefully the next two days after tonight well get two ballgames in one way or another
5512988 the tampa st petesburg area is obviously a priority and this domed stadium is an evacuation center
5512989 were going to do whatever the league tells us to do whatever the city and state officials tell us to do
5512990 the worst case scenario is were swept into the gulf of mexico
5512991 you want a medium case scenario hopefully were going to get three games in
5512992 theyre going to strap us down in seat belts in our hotel room and hopefully the cable stays on
5512993 i knew joe would eventually build an organization to do this its happened quicker than what you might expect
5512994 we not only lost the game but we may have also lost our catcher wang wei for the rest of the olympics he got hit in the leg they play hard and we play hard
5512995 if you have a guy at homeplate you never come up and try to hit the guy in the chest i felt that was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected him after that the game got out of hand
5512996 we do not throw to hit people he tried to throw the ball inside and it got away from him the umpire lost control of the game he created this
5512997 were not here to fight i would rather have slid but the catcher was in the way
5512998 we cannot forever take that convenient excuse from the hierarchy of a group that is supposedly talking peace with government it is their responsibility if they are really sincere and well meaning to rein in their forces
5512999 we will pursue and take aggressive actions against the perpetrators of these dastardly acts against innocent civilians
5513000 we will file appropriate charges and other legal actions against the criminal group in coordination with the police we will continue with the operations it will not stop with the clearing of the areas occupied by them
5513001 the new package will really help with recruitment and importantly will help us to keep the really hard working doctors currently in our public hospitals
5513002 our public service doctors will be among the best paid in australia
5513003 we have also committed to increasing the number of staff in our emergency departments and reforming the way they work to relieve the pressure
5513004 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5513005 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5513006 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out
5513007 if i challenge any of you to beer pong i just might have you beat
5513008 too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5513009 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5513010 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5513011 don the bar owner and i will have a talk about slander
5513012 oh yeah i know the face but the name is hard to remember to me he looks like a big strong horse
5513013 this is the plan that will catapult the lansing city market to new heights of success
5513014 all contractors must adhere to the city of lansings taxing regulations which include reporting income tax and wage detail information
5513015 this radical departure from pickup design is aluminum based rather than copper
5513016 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5513017 its very appropriate that our state agricultural ambassador starts her year long statewide drive at an ethanol plant and that she does so driving our ethanol fueled car
5513018 having alice in dairyland drive the wisconsin corn promotion boards e85 chevy tahoe while she promotes agriculture across the state is the perfect symbol of how corn based ethanol drives our states economy in an economical fuel efficient and renewable manner
5513019 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5513020 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5513021 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5513022 it must have dropped about 20 feet it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5513023 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5513024 its an extremely dangerous road its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off
5513025 i heard what sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5513026 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker bus it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and rolled over
5513027 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one to university hospital of north staffordshire twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital

5513076 parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children
5513077 we conclude that california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
5513078 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling the team effort was remarkable
5513079 parents have a constitutional right to make educational choices for their children
5513080 thousands of california families have educated their children successfully through homeschooling were pleased with the courts decision which protects the rights of families and protects an avenue of education that has proven to benefit children time and time again
5513081 under these circumstances it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that home schools are permissible in california when conducted as private schools

5513083 google is known for innovation not only in the way they run their company but also in their applications and people seem to like some of the other services they have better than what yahoo and the others have
5513084 from a business perspective probably the most important metric you can have is whether you are satisfying your customers
5513085 because satisfied customers are going to be more loyal and recommend the service to other people
5513086 most of the services that google offers today they offered a year ago
5513087 because of the word of mouth factor there is a delay that happens between an innovation being launched and the average person understanding it

5513120 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5513121 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5513122 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5513123 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5513124 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5513136 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
5513137 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced

5513172 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5513173 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5513174 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5513189 we received over 5000 applications this year and you were the only person to answer no to the question are you a leader we are admitting over 1000 of those applicants including you we figured with all of those leaders well need at least one follower

5513193 hope in other words is necessary to bring about change but it is never enough change also requires effective leadership inside government
5513194 adams had a wonderful r sum but his temperament was just not well suited
5513195 what people are looking for is judgment and we hope that is going to be served by experience but often it is not adams is a great example of somebody who just could not overcome his pettiness
5513196 that ability to know what is important who to pick who to listen to what you put first in your priorities all of that really doesnt come from the sort of experience you get from being in the united states senate long term

5513200 rpt when it comes to race us politicians talk in code
5513201 blacks feel like they have more responsibility for exposing and discussing racism whites generally feel that they dont want to be involved
5513202 the anger about their fight will exist regardless of what he does so giving her this role and this moment might help diminish any sense that he just wants to write her out of the history of this contest
5513203 i feel this sometimes has something to do with something i care about and as things go in u s politics its not the worst thing to happen
5513204 how race survived u s history from settlement and slavery to the obama phenomenon
5513205 obama does not represent the triumph of an advancing anti racist movement but rather the necessity at the highly refracted level of electoral politics of abandoning old agendas largely by not mentioning them
5513206 its an odd paradox that this will shrink even further any kind of public space to talk about race
5513207 everybody is so enticed and intrigued all at once just by the mere fact that hes black as if thats enough
5513208 it is this very weird moment where republicans are very divided
5513209 its accurate to say that you dont have a dominant set of ideas or a figure the party can really rally behind what you simply see are factions who arent forming to create a coherent vision
5513210 the 70s the great shift in american culture society and politics
5513211 youve seen this amazing united front by different factions that are much more at odds ideologically than the factions within the democratic party theyve all managed to put their feelings about one another aside to defeat a common enemy i dont think the fracturing youre seeing now will result in large numbers of republicans voting for obama but i do think youll see people willing to sit on their hands instead of work towards that common goal as they have in the past
5513212 from the chaos opportunity bush policies may pave way for democratic reforms
5513213 whoever is elected is going to inherit a terrible mess both domestically and internationally
5513214 but when things get really bad theres often an opportunity for change i dont rule out the possibility of some major reforms
5513215 from the chaos opportunity bush policies may pave way for democratic reforms
5513216 as a result of the polarization that bush created the democrats are much more unified
5513217 an obama administration is going to have a lot of support across the board for a fairly radical shift on iraq

5513225 after only getting a bronze in oslo in 2024 i was determined
5513226 i had to be as strong as possible because i wanted to win that medal for my family and all the girls in my church quilting club back home
5513227 my mother has end stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust pct the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5513228 i said are you sure and she said i may be dying but i know how much money i had in my handbag
5513229 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5513230 we thought it would be a long process but allen was greedy we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers

5513234 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5513235 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5513236 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5513237 it must have dropped about 20 feet it was on a slope there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority were walking wounded
5513238 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway they couldnt have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through
5513239 its an extremely dangerous road its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour just before it happened i was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off
5513240 i heard what sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5513241 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker bus it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and rolled over
5513242 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one to university hospital of north staffordshire twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital

5513260 revival is such a display of gods holiness and power that often human personalities are overshadowed and human programs abandoned it is god breaking into the consciousness of men in majesty and glory
5513261 revival is the church falling in love with jesus all over again
5513262 a true revival means nothing less than a revolution casting out a spirit of worldliness and selfishness and making god in his love triumph in the heart and life
5513263 revival is ultimately christ himself seen felt heard living active moving in and through his body on earth
5513264 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5513265 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot
5513266 i am very pleased to carry on as club captain this season
5513267 it was my first season as captain last year and although i am 31 now i am still learning
5513268 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5513269 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5513270 i know a lot more about the job now thanks to last season
5513271 we are a young side and some more promising youngsters have come through for this season but they have all got the quality which you need to have if you play for

5513278 my colleagues and i shared a common obsession about pay grades which means we all wanted higher ones
5513279 im not qualified to answer that question because it is a matter for scientists and theologians to ponder and i am neither

5513281 the heat in chillis capsaicin resides in the white flesh to which the seeds are attached
5513282 thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people
5513283 and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
5513284 i think that maybe lauren is tired of being on the show but were just beginning

5513288 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5513289 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5513290 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5513291 animal rights groups are entitled to their opinion but many people do not share this opinion and it is certainly not reflected in the rising global demand for fur
5513292 regrettably not everyone understands the difference between animal welfare which has the full commitment of our sector and animal rights which seeks to ban every animal use by man whether for food medical or scientific research clothing or companionship
5513293 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5513294 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
5513295 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
5513296 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
5513297 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
5513298 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
5513299 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
5513300 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
5513301 i achieved my first goal playing basketball for germany in the olympics
5513302 now my main goal is to win the nba championship
5513303 well have to wait and see how things develop with germany in the years ahead
5513304 i dont want to make any concrete plans right now
5513305 but i knew when i came off the court tonight that it was the last time for a couple of years so from that point of view it was a wonderful feeling to go out on a high note
5513306 everythings still open but i think i need a break
5513307 if we were to qualify for that id be happy to talk about the question i think the difficult thing will be to qualify its been 16 years since the last time
5513308 obviously now there is much tighter engineering opportunity to be much closer aligned with saps applications
5513309 we have to be realistic its one company so the openness has its limits
5513310 its easier to sell business objects to sap than to sell sap to business objects
5513311 the good news is at least for the first half of the year we are seen as an open and agnostic solution set
5513312 we feel we may have lost customers in the past because we may not have had the right solution weve got the right solution today
5513313 there are a lot of young enthusiastic energetic and innovative people with great ideas in the ict sector but they are incredibly poor in articulating those issues on paper
5513314 out of 100 business plans on my table 90 dont have the right information needed
5513315 we receive requests for funding from kenya tanzania uganda rwanda and burundi but unfortunately we screen them too fast
5513316 it is a lot of work to go through them and turn them around people need to get more training and come up with business plans that are fundable
5513317 it is true some of our most innovative engineering students do not know how to write business plans capable of being funded but that is also a challenge among established business people
5513318 my back suddenly went into spasm last night giving me more pain than ive ever experienced in my life and a totally numb left foot
5513319 but heres the deal would you believe that there just happens to be a chiropractors conference going on at the hotel
5513320 so a very nice doctor from cancun had given my aching vertebra some adjustments and a great big cortisone shot which should help me to get to the airport tonight im gutted of course because i was totally primed up to attend the media event but at this point in time im actually having difficulty getting out of bed
5513321 at first i must say i felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5513322 got an mri scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish freezing and numb im going to have to get myself a crutch and a parrot so i can fob myself off as a pirate and scare the neighbourhood preschoolers just kidding folks

5513344 yeeaaa i like my system too much to tinker with like that and have 400 go down the drain
5513345 casual non gamers who damn near need to be begged through huge budget advertising to try out a system dont deserve the entertainment that this great industry provides

5513351 yes because everybody wants to pay 800 1200 points for twenty year old nes games that sold millions of copies already
5513352 having emulators on a system with virtual console sitting right there giving devs the money they earned is a slap in the face
5513353 yes because everybody wants to pay 800 1200 points for twenty year old nes games that sold millions of copies already
5513354 the money goes to the company that currently owns the rights to the games which in many cases isnt even the same company that originally released it
5513355 will there be an online game for the wii this generation that is amazing that ill want to play online
5513356 i guess you guys hate games then because 3rd parties always move away from machines that seem to be too pirate ready see dreamcast and psp
5513357 well you needed a mod chip on the psx and ps2
5513358 do what edge has done for years in print but online
5513359 obviously we still have lots of friends and a ton of history there at cnet but were so focused on the good stuff were doing now
5513360 were not in the business of reporting news but as far as the review process goes were being very open about a review being that persons perspective we dont use fancy math to come to our reviews we just go with what the reviewer feels the game merits i think when a review has to represent an entire organizations perspective on a game thats where you can run into trouble also for what its worth ive never considered myself a game journalist i think they exist but im a reviewer and a commentator more than anything
5513361 were still just four guys and we still feel that theres plenty of places to get coverage out there our focus will be on commentary and perspective on the significant goings on in video games and you know fun we dont want to run sales numbers stories theres enough business out there in the game press everyone trying to be serious journalists ive got big respect for the way guys like totilo carry themselves but no id rather do stuff that makes me laugh ill be honest i wasnt 100 sure this was going to work before we launched but the response weve gotten so far has been so overwhelming im confident that were doing something that no one else really is
5513362 i think when a review has to represent an entire organizations perspective on a game thats where you can run into trouble
5513363 i think were just seeing the raw passion that people have for video games ive described our system as an rpg except instead of grinding orcs youre contributing to a huge community of people who share your passion for this stuff its interactive so it makes sense that people who play video games would enjoy a certain level of interactivity no our tools are extremely easy to use and i think our barrier for entry is lower than other wikis also it was built with games in mind so the data structure caters to video games in a more meaningful way than a general wiki
5513364 as significant as that user created stuff is were still focusing on providing the same kind of game coverage as we did with the blog same style same tone we all ended up feeling really good about the coverage we had for e3 which was essentially a handful of casual video wrap ups and a lengthy podcast at the end of each day the two types of content share the page in a number of spots but we have enough dedicated spots on a page that will always be editorial
5513365 i think for us one of the key differences is that we dont have a sales team on one floor and an edit team on another each making decisions with vastly different priorities
5513366 at some point down the road there will be ads were still hammering out how exactly were going to approach that stuff and its something that were going to talk with our community a lot about i think how its approached and how the organization decides to prioritize it and approve it are all critical i think for us one of the key differences is that we dont have a sales team on one floor and an edit team on another each making decisions with vastly different priorities and with our relative size we dont really need a lot of money to do what we want to do that helps

5513447 this is how we do things and so far it works pretty well
5513448 we scientists were taught by the scientists who trained us to apply these procedures to construct our picture of the world and we have faith in this way of doing things
5513449 how useful to the society at large has some science been
5513450 how much of science has been useful to the society at large
5513451 i think youre going to have to do better than suggest that concern for concepts is
5513452 we see reality not as it is in itself but as we are
5513453 o brave new world that has such people in it
5513454 make many observations without bias generalize from those observations to obtain theories test those theories by observations if the theories pass their tests they are verified if the theories fail their tests those theories are proven to be false
5513455 method is taken seriously only by the most provincial and illiterate
5513456 for centuries people believed that newton had attained his laws the way hed claimed to have attained them turns out its logically impossible to attain them that way one quick version of this point its logically impossible for any strict induction to ever get you to newtonian theory etc see for instance duhem popper on this
5513457 as for newtons production of laws i dont think youre qualified to even speculate on what the mind of one of the greatest geniuses of all time was and was not capable of and the difference between impossible and nearly impossible doesnt seem to be something you appreciate
5513458 the qualities of bodies within the reach of our experiments are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever
5513459 thus it was that the laws of motion and of gravitation were discovered
5513460 dont have a conceptual definition of science then you look at the things people refer to as science and try to understand what if anything unites them into a set performing tests to see whether your speculations match the reality in other words you perform a cycle of observation speculation based on observation testing and observation again
5513461 whats hard is convincing people who made decisions based on social status and credulity in authority figures that a given set of arguments is composed of lies
5513462 decisions based on social status and credulity in authority figures
5513463 does writing off philosophy of science cost the scientists anything
5513464 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5513466 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5513467 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5513468 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5513469 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5513470 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5513472 the estimated billion sale of aol will add a potential 50 of near term per share upside to time warner but do nothing to fortify its digital content future if digital content constitutes only 10 of time warners business today maybe its because it functions as a business afterthought by next year a streamlined and simplified time warner will have nothing else to think about except maybe what to use as an excuse for digital content failure
5513473 we werent consulted about the arrangements prior to the announcement so its given us little time to really digest what is proposed and talk to our members about what this might mean for them but certainly we will be doing that over the next couple of weeks
5513474 people have been talking about getting tough on youth crime for the last 20 years or more here in the territory so it cant be the same youth

5513476 were hoping that in the out of home care area in the child protection area that there will be a lot of consideration given to the ways that the department supports and validates the carers that it does have and also that things like access to training arent put on the back burner
5513477 its a good time to fly if you want to put up with the grief
5513478 a drop of 30 a barrel helps but traffic is collapsing so airlines are having to discount like crazy to fill their planes
5513479 i didnt expect any fare sales so it was surprising
5513480 its a pretty telling sign that we are close to a tipping point
5513481 its a good time to fly if you want to put up with the grief
5513482 a drop of 30 a barrel helps but traffic is collapsing so airlines are having to discount like crazy to fill their planes
5513483 i didnt expect any fare sales so it was surprising
5513484 its a pretty telling sign that we are close to a tipping point
5513485 i dont expect people to be happy but you know we got a job to do
5513486 we use that money to buy the new police cars and the rest goes to help with the revenues
5513487 its definitely a benefit to the town its revenue to the town
5513488 for the most part theyre not really going to impact safety
5513489 i got pulled over for two things for speeding and improper use of the left lane
5513490 the latter i think is total bull i was going about 20 miles over the speed limit i was in the left lane
5513491 there probably are a lot of folks who feel they were duped but i hate to admit i was in the wrong
5513492 i dont expect people to be happy but you know we got a job to do
5513493 we use that money to buy the new police cars and the rest goes to help with the revenues
5513494 its definitely a benefit to the town its revenue to the town
5513495 for the most part theyre not really going to impact safety
5513496 it doesnt help anybody when you have such a quick succession of ministers in a particular portfolio
5513497 if you dont reduce services then the clients are just as much penalised if not more because youre unable to provide them with safe care in the environment
5513498 weve had a small group of nurses not all nurses doing an extraordinary amount of overtime
5513499 this dredging will simply put the area under too much stress and the environmental damage will be extensive
5513500 the government is trying to argue that they will take various remedial measures but the experts that are advising the greens have no confidence that this will lessen the damage
5513501 the clear answer here is that that the dredging should not go ahead
5513502 there will be some minor disruptions theres no doubt about that but what we will do is make sure the environmental impacts are limited and temporary and at the same time well seek to minimise the disruption to recreational users
5513503 a whole range of environmental measures have been put in place including the use of silt curtains designed to catch sediment preventing it from flowing into the remaining parts of the water
5513504 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5513505 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5513506 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5513507 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5513508 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills
5513509 but american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5513510 in matters of national security good judgement will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5513511 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5513512 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5513513 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5513514 we have maintained since the beginning of this process that andre was a main priority for us because he is one of the best all around young players in the league and an integral part to the success of our team
5513515 we are excited that we are able to keep a player with andres talent athleticism and work ethic here in philadelphia
5513516 the board s failure to engage in a more proactive sale process may constitute a breach of the good faith component of the duty of loyalty as taught in stone v ritter
5513517 c tait pas matante catoo le pire souvent cest la position que tu occuppe si en plus fbeaule04 tchendoh je sais que tu ne me blastais pas je voulais pas donner

5513525 it will be interesting to see if vodafone and optus can deliver on their network coverage promises we have a vastly superior network infrastructure

5513532 de toekomst van het nederlandse scheidsrechterskorps ziet er zonnig uit
5513533 uit de hoogste twee divisies van de uefa de elite en groep n nemen komend jaar zestien scheidsrechters afscheid vanwege het bereiken van de 45 jarige leeftijd hetgeen neerkomt op 40 procent
5513534 achttien arbiters komen in aanmerking om die plekken op te vullen en nederland heeft als enige land in europa twee kandidaten kevin blom en bj rn kuipers
5513535 ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik niet enthousiast ben over hetgeen wat er de laatste tijd is gebeurd
5513536 die bijeenkomst is verplicht een licentie eis van de uefa
5513537 bij de seizoensstart in duitsland werden bij bayern hsv twee penaltys gegeven nee ik denk niet dat in n wedstrijd vijf of zes strafschoppen zullen worden toegekend de arbiter waarschuwt eerst voordat de corner of vrije trap is genomen geeft daarna geel en pas daarna eventueel een penalty we zullen bovendien geen spijkers op laag water zoeken
5513538 we zijn blij dat roelof zich net als ren temmink gaat bezighouden met het opleiden van scheidsrechters dit seizoen zal hij al proefdraaien hij heeft z lang meegelopen en gaat heel positief om met de jonge jongens
5513539 maar of dat in de praktijk ook zo is de voorkeur gaat uit naar anderen die internationaal actief zijn

5513616 what peter costello did is the day after the federal election he gave a clear and unambiguous indication of what he proposed to do

5513634 thats a very significant factor in a customers decision making process

5513662 from conversations i have had with local police officers i am aware there are specific areas of the a81 a82 a84 a85 a875 and the a811 that continue to be locations in which collisions occur on too regular a basis
5513663 i intend to meet with both the police and representatives of the roads department at stirling council to investigate if there are any measures that can be taken that further reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring
5513664 officers were deployed at the weekend right across central scotlands rural roads network
5513665 the weekend is always a busy time on our roads and our operation was a high profile reminder to road users that safety should be their top priority not getting from a to b as quickly as possible
5513666 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5513667 unfortunately a lot of them are not going to be able to be answered in the immediate future
5513668 i dont think no 1 were ever going to put the suspicions to bed theres always going to be a spore on the grassy knoll
5513669 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5513670 throughout his career daniel squadron has demonstrated an intelligent progressive approach to challenging the status quo and getting results and in this campaign he has shown courage that is almost unheard of in albany only one candidate in this race will be the powerful voice for progressive change that we so desperately need in albany that is why as someone who cares deeply about reforming government at every level i am proud to support daniel squadron

5513697 nothings wrong i just have a slight headache thats all dont worry about it
5513698 not worry youve used that excuse for the past few days weeks even cmon im not dumb whats going on
5513699 do you think love is a choice or by chance
5513700 its by chance if you fall in love you dont exactly have a choice do you
5513701 for me its a bit of both a chance meeting with someone is still a choice for example you met that person in the street both of you chose to take the same route and when you bumped into each other it became a chance encounter you dont fall in love by chance its still up to you if you really want to love this person murder charges and all or not our minds like to play tricks on us thats why we think we couldnt help falling in love contrary to what books and movies had us believe love is a decision and not just a mere feeling
5513702 im not going to argue with you on that at some level i agree with you but what brought on this sudden insight
5513703 its not sudden i said that almost a year ago when a friend asked me the same question i realized i wasnt completely right you cant decide not to fall in love
5513704 is it so bad to let go and give in
5513705 to fall in love is to create a religion with a fallible god i dont remember who spoke these words it doesnt really matter what matters is that it is true i did fall in love but you are not fallible yet
5513706 if i answer that then it would mean i quantified my feelings for you i cant explain it it just happened i couldnt stop it
5513707 i had no idea if i knew i wouldnt have that wouldnt have happened
5513708 sorry for what that you dont love me you dont have to apologize for something that you dont feel i wish i could say it doesnt hurt that you love her but i cant pretend anymore
5513709 youre special to me youre a very good friend i love you as a friend youre one of the greatest people ive ever met nothing can take that away but im sorry im still in love with her
5513710 its okay i understand like i said you dont have to apologize for something that you dont feel and for something that you do
5513711 ill try to get over you for my sake dont worry about me reach for the stars
5513712 most of all john steinway sounds so good because they never compromise on quality each wood piece raw wood has to be perfect they store away the wood in perfect housing for decades perfect materials or they dont build next and this is only true of steinway each man did one job only for the rest of his life you made one little part and you made it perfectly and no one could take your job away because you were the only one of maybe three people in the world who could do that tiny but crucial job we felt very special everyone knew everyone we all knew who was building what and wed come and check that it fit perfectly fifty a hundred times if we had to
5513713 dont ever get anything but a steinway and dont ever get it rebuilt unless the guy worked directly for steinway even now they are still the same and will never change

5513725 our batteries have already been tested by the united states advanced battery consortium which is general motors ford and chrysler we are the only battery company today using this lithium ion technology which has met or exceeded all of the big threes requirements especially and most importantly best in class in safety this is really a supply problem much of the world now including detroit grasps that more efficient internal combustion engines and biofuels such as ethanol will not bring about the major environmental improvements and freedom from foreign oil that the times demand the lithium ion battery is the holy grail is now a given and we and others have proven that its a fully realizable technology for revolutionizing automotive transportation
5513726 the saab 9 3 performed well in front and side crash tests and the saab active head restraints provide state of the art protection against neck injuries the addition of electronic stability control as standard equipment confirms saabs commitment to vehicle safety
5513727 we are delighted with the overwhelming support and interest from the global automotive industry
5513728 our vibrant exhibition sector is committed to supporting and boosting the countrys global presence and economic ties and the middle east international motor show 2007 is a prime example of how we continually strive to achieve these goals
5513729 therefore the new accord boasts lower wider and longer proportions than its predecessors coupled with superior levels or refinement and equipment
5513730 the success and popularity of nissans suv range motivated us to expand this lineup with new products that boast the best of nissan quality and innovation
5513731 and we are expecting an equal level of interest in the middle east
5513732 people dont think green when suvs are concerned and for generally good reason since most other vehicles chevrolets tahoe hybrid changes this dynamic with a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 30 per cent compared to similar vehicles equipped with a standard v 8
5513733 theyve proven that they can make beautiful cars keep the size keep the safety and all those kinds of things and at the same time be more fuel efficient
5513734 we finished eight at bristol and eight at phoenix earlier this year with the avenger i think that showed us pretty early in the game that we felt confident with the new cars it certainly makes us breath easier knowing that we can be up front with this car it came early for us and we have had time to continue to work on it
5513735 were coming back to repeat another good performance i think you certainly look at what worked before but now have a lot more notes to pull from too we have a lot more information but so does everyone else
5513736 ive always felt pretty good about the car of tomorrow races like i said we had a good jump on it and that helped its a boxier car its top heavier and everyone has had that struggle of making it turn its just not designed to do what the other cars do that was probably the purpose its tough because there is such a small box to work in especially when you are trying to turn on track like phoenix its tough on the mechanics and crew chiefs the drivers are screaming to make it turn but there is only so much you can adjust you just have to learn to race with it
5513737 turning the car in the corner has been the biggest factor all the cars are fine going straight thats not the issue but getting them through the turn has been the puzzle petty enterprises put in a lot of work on this program and we understand the car that has helped us with the performance all year we have more to learn but were getting better and have a good understanding of it
5513738 driving in america cojures images of route 66 and route 1 and in australia its the great ocean road in britain were more likely to think of the m25 and the m6 its hardly surprising that driving in britain is regarded as more pain than pleasure
5513739 the open expanses and sweeping hillside routes of cumbria scotland and devon dominate britains best drives taking the top three spots in our poll the stunning scenery challenging twists and turns and almost traffic free driving on these roads are ideal for an enjoyable and relaxing journey
5513740 for most of us driving in britain is one long traffic jam but id doesnt have to be like that its easy to forget how much pleasure you can get from driving down a country road with its variety of corners views and challenges
5513741 with all the headlines about congestion speed cameras and poor road surfaces its easy to forget that driving can be such a positive experience
5513742 when we tallied up the donations and saw that they were topping 20 million we were thrilled
5513743 we work every day helping people donating cars on the one hand and moving the proceeds on to charities on the other how astounding it is to find out that we have passed 20 million on to benefit other charities
5513744 we know weve been doing the right thing because were busy and we have a file drawer full of testimonials and thats really why this 20 million mark is so gratifying

5513748 the road weve traveled to here is just the beginning we have a lot of work ahead of us and some new programs we hope to be announcing in the near future too

5513757 new 2008 models are starting to hit dealer lots in significant numbers and manufacturers are pushing their marketing efforts to make consumers aware of those new models
5513758 that being said there are still plenty of new 2007 vehicles on dealer lots and valuable incentives that make this a pretty good time to buy for consumers
5513759 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5513760 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5513761 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5513762 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5513763 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5513764 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5513765 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5513766 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5513767 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5513768 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5513769 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5513770 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5513771 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5513772 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5513773 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5513774 after a gruelling recording mixing and mastering process during the early summer this ending s sophomore album dead harvest was finished however we are not entirely satisfied with the final mix and we believe it doesnt do the album justice rather than release something we are not 100 behind we have chosen to take a break and go back to remix and remaster the album the most important thing is to put out a killer album we apologize to our fans who have been waiting for dead harvest all this time all we can say is that its worth the wait currently the release has been pushed to somewhere around february 2009

5513811 while it is focused on negotiating a recommended offer for michael page adecco is keeping all its options open at this stage
5513812 our organic growth strategy of diversifying by both specialist discipline and geography has enabled us to achieve record results and be more robust and resilient with an increasingly difficult economic environment in some markets being balanced by others that remain strong
5513813 it is a late cycle business so if unemployment levels pick up then the company will suffer further down the line
5513814 but at the moment the fact that it is diversified by both sector and geography means michael page is a lot more defensive in respect of the uk economy than it was at the last downturn
5513815 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up
5513816 many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5513817 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for some time and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5513818 this is a drastic measure and will usually result in taking on a much greater level of mortgage debt than originally planned at a time when credit is more expensive and not as freely available
5513819 borrowers need to fully understand the costs and risks that come with being a landlord before putting additional stress on their finances both properties are likely to be subject to larger mortgages and payments need to be met whether there are tenants in place or not
5513820 farmers are basing their hopes on more spring rains to help them through the season
5513821 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
5513822 the drought is not only hitting rural areas hard city dwellers are paying the price at supermarkets for staples such as rice
5513823 water availability in irrigated agriculture areas like the murray valley is extremely low this has a cumulative effect affecting prices from the farm gate to the checkout
5513824 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year however we really need good rain before the end of august
5513825 farmers have a few other challenges on their hands as well with widespread frosts limiting pasture growth however grazing cereals have provided valuable feed
5513826 if warmer temperatures arrive early we could see locust hatchings as soon as early to mid september
5513827 it has been a tough process but we got there in the end
5513828 our planned business class only service will be the most convenient way to travel between london and new york for those people based in or travelling to the heart of london many city workers will be able to get from desk to aircraft in as little as 30 minutes this combined with shannon airports ability to complete usa arrival checks during the planned refuelling stop will ensure customers can make the most of their time and travel desk to desk in the quickest time possible
5513829 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
5513830 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
5513831 ive been learning and absorbing all the great music here and have been sitting in with some of the best players in town so its very inspiring

5513835 the stock is trading on 0 9 times estimated 2007 tangible net asset value versus 0 9 times for the sector generating a return on equity of 15 per cent versus the sector on 16 per cent in price earnings ratio terms the stock is trading on 6 7 times estimated 2007 earnings per share versus a sector average of 6 2 times

5513839 were in the same category as a club that has poker machine revenue of 20 million
5513840 1million may seem like a lot of money but when you have a golf course bowling greens and tennis courts with about 50 employees there isnt much left over
5513841 when mr kelly opened the surf reserve he commented on the golf course backing on to a surf reserve
5513842 he thinks its unfair and that we shouldnt pay it
5513843 our club board would have to strongly look at cutting back support for local sporting and community organisations
5513844 there are so many local organisations that rely on the country club and they would have no other means of sponsorship
5513845 crescent head country club is the dominant entertainment sporting service provider in the locality with strong historical cultural links with the past
5513846 the department is keen for the club to continue on with its current community based operations
5513847 a friend to the u s and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5513848 we are the number 4 antivirus company globally and the largest malware company in europe and we are still growing quickly we expect no less than 80 growth this year the secret to this success is our focus on technologies and less impetus on marketing
5513849 i have been astonished to see our retail presence grow with such strength over the last year to be the absolute number one in the consumer market is a task for the next year for us
5513850 generally a policy of the campaign nationally to charge a nominal fee for lawn signs
5513851 an occasional exception might be made for an outstanding volunteer
5513852 if someone balks at paying for a lawn sign and really wants one well work something out
5513853 a ministerial commission which met on monday approved the list of 200 palestinian prisoners who are to be released as a goodwill gesture toward palestinian president mahmud abbas
5513854 the same as in previous years except for two or three exceptional cases
5513855 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5513856 the release of prisoners is not interpreted as a gesture but rather as weakness the state of israel released hundreds of prisoners in recent months and the situation of abu mazen palestinian president mahmoud abbas has not changed gilad shalit is still in his kidnappers hands
5513857 when israel frees prisoners to weak elements without demanding anything in return they remain weak this is a decision conveying weakness and an acceptance of the existing situation why are we helping abu mazen instead of taking care of gilad shalits release first
5513858 in order to achieve our goal which is security we must hold negotiations which include a return negotiations with results rather than diplomacy which yields nice photo opportunities we hear about negotiations being held for more than a year but what has changed what results have we achieved what progress have we made this year
5513859 why should we turn around israel doesnt own that property we have been invited by the people of gaza
5513860 well stand in line link arms and tell them theyre not wanted
5513861 an anonymous man called my home in france as my daughters played hide and seek in the garden this stranger spoke to my husband warning him that your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up my husband asked how it was this person had obtained our private home number no response was forthcoming but the illicit threats carried on

5513865 the prophet joseph smith in the beginning talked about that a man should be out doing good and trying to find people where they are in the world to help
5513866 their retail investments have been a mixed bag although there have been successful ones
5513867 it is very difficult to see what is going on with the underlying strategy which is probably what they want
5513868 ive been up that way a few times over the years
5513869 its an area perfect for this kind of research people have disappeared up there and never been found again so it makes sense these mysterious creatures could have gone unnoticed
5513870 i dont want to catch one of these creatures all im out to prove is it exists and if so that its protected
5513871 im realistic even if i got a picture of a relic hominid on film i wouldnt publish it unless it was a1 clear
5513872 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
5513873 the fact that ukraine is no longer party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5513874 in order to prevent the circumstances in which the ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to ukrainian territory until the conflict is resolved

5513900 bringing home the olympic gold medal in baseball to the usa
5513901 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
5513902 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5513903 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
5513904 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
5513905 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5513906 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
5513907 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
5513908 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
5513909 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
5513910 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
5513911 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
5513912 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
5513913 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
5513914 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost
5513915 i did feel that there was something to prove to my father
5513916 word got back to kenyatta that the old man was a troublemaker and he was called in to see the president
5513917 its one of those situations where the devil is in the details
5513918 have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil
5513919 what im trying to do is create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5513920 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth
5513921 i came here especially to see him i am devastated i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang

5513924 went to hear kwame toure formerly stokely carmichael of sncc and black power fame speak at columbia
5513925 at the entrance to the auditorium two women one black one asian were selling marxist literature and arguing with each other about trotskys place in history
5513926 inside toure was proposing a program to establish economic ties between africa and harlem that would circumvent white capitalist imperialism
5513927 on arrival we found the working fire in the upstairs area
5513928 it extended into an attic space there was pretty heavy smoke heat and fire damage to the second floor and moderate heat smoke and water damage to the first floor
5513929 we have no dollar amount at this time but it was pretty heavily damaged
5513930 theres a substantial loss to the structure and its contents
5513931 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5513932 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual

5513954 lion i stung you because i am a scorpion that is what i do i have no honor and no pride therefore i have no word
5513955 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
5513956 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
5513957 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions
5513958 if you have 10 lanes or six lanes its academic

5514020 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

5514025 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5514026 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5514027 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5514028 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5514029 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5514030 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5514031 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5514032 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5514033 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5514034 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5514035 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5514036 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5514037 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5514038 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5514039 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5514040 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5514041 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5514042 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5514043 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5514044 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5514045 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5514046 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5514047 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5514048 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5514049 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5514050 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5514051 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5514052 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5514053 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5514054 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5514055 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5514056 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5514057 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5514058 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5514059 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5514060 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5514061 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5514062 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

5514065 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5514073 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5514074 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso

5514077 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5514079 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5514080 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5514081 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5514083 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5514084 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5514085 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5514086 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5514087 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5514088 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5514089 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5514090 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5514091 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5514092 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5514093 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5514094 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5514095 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5514096 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5514097 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5514098 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5514099 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5514100 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5514104 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5514106 understanding the power of media planning a documentary segment about peter a juvenile sentenced to life without parole
5514107 documentary filmmakers could make our school look positive or negative simply through the choice of information they present
5514108 a character filmed from a low angle will seem strong powerful tall proud etc whereas if a high angle is used the subject will appear weak insignificant vulnerable small etc our impression of a structure or object can be manipulated in a similar way a distorted angle may be used to make a scene more frightening or to make the viewer feel anxious or queasy especially if fast or jerky camera movement is also used
5514109 soft focus a slightly blurred shot to make the subject seem more attractive romantic nostalgic or dreamlike
5514110 it is time to get past these kinds of smear tactics and start focusing on real issues that matter to the voters
5514111 we as a country need to be to be doing more to help others
5514112 not only here in our country but also other oppressed places around the world i have done a small part to help and i am proud of what i have been able to do to help others now i am being attacked by the
5514113 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5514114 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5514115 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
5514116 if in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics
5514117 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5514118 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league
5514119 i think he has done a great job but i have been here a while so ive seen when rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5514120 all of a sudden the question goes out what happened and why isnt he still playing or making a lot of plays
5514121 this is his third preseason game im sure he wants to continue to improve most teams weve played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on recievers and are pretty much vanilla

5514136 this is a good book more people should be reading it
5514137 how did you know that ben is the reincarnation of john
5514138 i was going to contact ben about a certain matter
5514139 to complete our soul development in a single lifetime seems impossible to me
5514140 forty years ago i was told by a seer that i was a reincarnation of teresa of avila
5514141 much has been written about teresas life in spain as a vigorous reformer of the carmelite order and a disciplined explorer of mystical experience
5514142 the following aspects of teresas nature seem to be part of my own some of what teresa left undone in her spiritual life 500 years ago is what i seem to be determined to do in my own life i brought some of her gifts and challenges forward into this life
5514143 in 1982 i met a well known and respected spiritual teacher who i immediately recognized as john of the cross
5514144 conclusion the teresa incarnation has been a way shower for my spiritual development in this life it has helped me stay on purpose with my soul development and service and not get lost in the material world i can choose to evolve and be aware of patterns that disrupted my spiritual growth in a previous life and seek to dissolve them in this one remembering teresa is remembering my true identity susan trout november 19 2006
5514145 how did this little boy living in a town 500 miles away know so many things about a man who had died in istanbul fifty years before he was born what possible explanation could there be kemal had a very simple answer he said that he had been the man in a previous life
5514146 and one of the things that i strongly believe is that we are not going to as individuals be able to erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5514147 doesnt this really mean that the cost of both oil and gold have increased by
5514148 el circuito es impresionante y el lugar es fant stico por lo que estoy esperando que llegue el gran premio el equipo ha trabajado duro para preparar esta carrera porque es un circuito nuevo para todos nosotros pero desde el punto de vista de un piloto lo m s importante es la primera vez que corres en l y a continuaci n comienzas a comprender mejor el circuito
5514149 me gusta ir a circuitos nuevos porque son un nuevo reto y siempre hay algo que descubrir cada carrera es nica y esto me gusta aunque se trata de una pista nueva para nosotros conozco muy bien valencia de todas las pruebas que hemos hecho en el otro circuito es una ciudad animada y siempre parece que pasa algo por lo que debe ser un fin de semana divertido
5514150 espero un fin de semana muy competitivo porque en este momento somos muy fuertes nuestro objetivo es anotar m s puntos y si conseguimos subir al podio de nuevo ser a estupendo
5514151 todav a estoy sonriendo despu s de hungr a se trata de un resultado incre ble y una sensaci n fant stica espero que sea el primero de muchos podios en la f rmula 1 lo m s importante es que nos mostr lo competitivos que somos y adelantamos hasta el cuarto lugar en el campeonato de constructores
5514152 hay una gran atm sfera en el equipo y todos estamos trabajando juntos para avanzar raz n por la cual conseguimos el podio en hungr a pero valencia es una nueva carrera y tenemos que empezar de nuevo hice un mont n de carreras en circuitos urbanos cuando estaba en las carreras de champ cars y durante esa temporada casi todas las pistas eran nuevas para m por lo que aprend a adaptarme r pidamente
5514153 parece un interesante circuito y es bastante largo por lo que deber a darse un buen espect culo tendremos mucho trabajo que hacer el viernes para ajustar el coche a la pista pero estamos en buena forma en este momento por lo que me siento optimista para este fin de semana
5514154 we had him for two years and he developed some health problems so we had to put him to
5514155 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5514156 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5514157 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5514158 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5514159 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5514160 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5514161 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5514166 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5514167 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5514168 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5514169 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5514170 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5514171 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5514172 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5514173 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5514178 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5514179 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5514180 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5514181 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5514182 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5514183 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5514184 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5514185 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5514186 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5514187 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5514188 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5514189 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5514190 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5514191 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5514192 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5514193 ben tiyatro yapmak istiyorum ses o kadar abuk y pranm yor ama g r nt daha abuk y pran yor ve daha abuk harcan yorsunuz
5514194 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5514195 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5514196 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5514197 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5514198 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5514199 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5514200 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5514201 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5514202 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5514203 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5514204 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5514205 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5514206 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5514207 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5514208 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5514209 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5514210 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5514211 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5514212 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5514213 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5514214 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5514215 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5514216 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5514217 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5514218 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5514219 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5514220 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5514221 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5514222 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5514223 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5514254 oh and if youre wondering why i kissed youre nose its because thats the only place where theres a mole on your face
5514255 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5514256 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5514257 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5514258 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5514259 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5514260 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5514261 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5514262 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5514263 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5514264 in which burning sensations occur and simple touch can feel like hurt it is unaffected by aspirin like drugs and fairly resistant to stronger analgesics such as opiates
5514265 in a 2007 study on neuropathic pain related to hiv infection 50 patients smoked marijuana cigarettes three times a day or marijuana cigarettes from which active ingredients had been extracted the results published in the journal neurology showed a 34 reduction in ratings of pain in the marijuana group compared with 17 in the placebo group over five days of treatment another study in 44 patients reported in june in the journal of pain found that marijuana alleviated neuropathic pain arising from a variety of conditions including spinal cord injury and diabetes average pain ratings before smoking were 55 on a 100 point scale and decreased by 46 in both treatment groups and by 27 in the placebo group one hour after the last puff
5514266 we are hoping that by questioning motorists pedestrians and other people in the area we will be able to jog peoples memories
5514267 hopefully someone will recall seeing mr campbell as he walked up westburn road last tuesday morning

5514269 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers

5514288 i dont think its quite as good as spain or greece but its right up there its a physical league

5514304 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store

5514313 left no doubt that it was a deliberate intrusion into the air space of the soviet union with hostile purposes
5514314 i felt a hollow sounding explosion it was behind and there was a kind of orange flash
5514315 the real intention of making use of the provocative incursion of the u 2 plane into the soviet air space as a pretext for wrecking a summit meeting plunging the world again into the state of cold war aggravating the tensions in international relations and putting a brake on the great powers talks on disarmament

5514352 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5514420 the main concern we have is his well being but topping the list is the welfare of these kids theyve gone through something where theyll carry this emotionally for the rest of their lives
5514421 i talked to soderberg approximately 10 days ago and he told me hes not coming just after i talked to him i talked to claes and it seemed we all understood the situation the kid wants to play another year over there and were fine with that

5514426 after that i hope to get a job and be involved in the maccabi games which is like the olympics but for jews
5514427 because of the instability of the middle east people think im mad to do this but its a bigger thing thats behind it all it will be difficult to leave but my family are supportive

5514434 a captain you need more in the bad times than in the good someone who steps forward and takes responsibility observed joe cole yesterday before expanding on ferdinand and terry two players he knows well
5514435 both are very similar they have the attributes of being well respected by the team top internationals at the peak of their game experienced vocal in the dressing room and both lead by example
5514436 i went to the same school as stephen and ill never forget when the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said he had been killed ferdinand said
5514437 one day the guy was enjoying life and talking about his a levels and the next day he was gone he was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction
5514438 dont think he is a good role model for kids kicking a female steward at chelsea last season was mentioned
5514439 being first on the scene in the refs face when a decision goes the other way and being a
5514440 hes not a superstar like other players and we always play better when its gerrard and barry together argued one supporter

5514470 grim was then 25 years old and was that time bald headed from then on he was called bald grim
5514471 joseph nagy 1981 has shown that in medieval ireland baldness is associated either with low rank slaves for example or in contrast with liminality druids for example or heroes undergoing intiation such as finn mac cumhail and this matches what we find in homers presentation of thersites who was bald as well as crippled and deformed and who was treated like a slave yet functioned as high level advisor to agamemnon
5514472 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them

5514479 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5514480 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5514481 ive been living in my body a lot longer than my daughter has in hers
5514482 eli is a confident girl and im proud of her but a 21 year old cant know what she wants i do
5514483 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5514484 the fact that were still reading news items about deadwood nearly two years after it aired its final episode just goes to show you how much its missed
5514485 will arnett part 1 how to get the arrested development movie made
5514486 and tells fans that if they want it to happen they should try one of the following
5514487 as well intentioned as rangers and tlt were as enticing as it was to return to those familiar waters in the end i think they did more to subtract from the legacy than add to it i dont regret having made them because i needed to go through that to get to the point where i am now psychologically but from where i sit now i wouldnt make them again
5514488 at the end of the day for me its not just a matter of getting more b5 its a matter of getting more good b5 that respects what came before it and doesnt have to compromise visually or in terms of action the original show deserves better than that the surviving cast members deserve better than that and the fans who have supported it over the years definitely deserve better than that a lot better
5514489 i am often asked what i think of the string of batman features which has followed my answer disappoints truth is i think only rarely about warners big screen charades for they are related to our antique effort in little beyond the eponymous title
5514490 everyone associated with the project was really heartened by the fans and by the new fans to the show
5514491 if david wants to do it wed be delight to explore that
5514492 heres the bottom line its a wonderful show and i wish it were on hbo matt weiner is an extraordinary talent and i hope that one day hell do something for us
5514493 honey i know i married you but you know i love myself more than you
5514494 i spoke to david chase a month ago and he said no he said he thought about it and he cant figure out a way to do it so i dont think it will ever happen i dont think you can ever say never but my hunch is it wont happen
5514495 it certainly got a lot of attention i thought it worked everybody was talking about it i dont know that it was satisfying but it certainly was paid a lot of attention
5514496 she has a terrific bright fresh approach to jeannies story with a twist and turn along the way she captured all of our imaginations in the telling of it
5514497 they claim me as their own as they do in canada as they do in new york its fine with me
5514498 we were all under contract at the same time it was my education as a film actress and not a theater rat the system was like rep every week i was in another show charlies angels quincy starsky and hutch
5514499 i had no idea i remember doing that show because i was a fan of bill bixby from my favorite martian
5514500 she was not part of the enterprise she was a che guevera she was going to shake things up nicholas meyer and leonard nimoy were both so supportive like when i wanted her to have a hugenot hairdo and for her to have this very close relationship with spock but also see that he had clay feet
5514501 if you leak the story you lose your house duchovny made this clear on leno
5514502 also the eye bleed reminds me too much of heroes
5514503 you cant tell him you tell him and i will spank you i will spank you like a bad bad donkey okay
5514504 what do you get when you cross an elephant with a rhino
5514505 though i still dont understand why everyone picks the fugitive one of the most overrated movies of the past 25 years and nothing like the tv show really and do we need that many star trek movies on the list including lesser ones like insurrection
5514506 benim disarida da bir hayatim var arkadaslarim var t m zamanimi burada geciremem

5514510 today was certainly more action than hes gotten and the plan is to get him in saturday
5514511 hes getting a lot better hes in shape so im hopeful we go this week each day without any setbacks
5514512 ive been in this league for seven years and you know how to take care of your body
5514513 you see guys coming in and out of this league and the guys who take care of their bodies the best are the guys that stay in the league im doing everything i can on my part im excited about the opportunity and i dont want to do something stupid and hurt something else by pushing too hard weve got a couple of good weeks ahead of us to be ready for the real games
5514514 if you dont see me out there practicing im working on the treadmill underwater so im getting myself prepared and in shape
5514515 the only thing i can do is keep concentrating on learning the offensive play book which i think i have a good grasp ive spent some good time with drew its going to be fun weve got a lot of time like i said this week im going to push it a little bit more just to see how it goes from there
5514516 we probably would have expected him to have gotten more work probably in the second preseason game but were here right now and weve got plenty of practice opportunities for him
5514517 the down side would be pushing it and having a setback and not having him for the first week of the season
5514518 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5514519 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5514520 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5514521 even if he wants publicity hes still a great guy
5514522 to be able to save more money for seeing the sights well go sleep in a tent or a train station
5514523 im on unpaid leave but its worth it there are so many people who have no chance to watch the games
5514524 but its all about the atmosphere i just wanted to bring them here and surely they know about liu xiang and the hurdles
5514525 not bad i feel really terrible about liu xiang though
5514526 i felt upset and angry with the onslaught against innocent women and children in countries such as russia
5514527 deep commitment to and involvement in violent jihad by promoting it inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill
5514528 assassinating named personnel and foreign tourists and freeing captured brothers from the enemy
5514529 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5514530 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5514531 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5514532 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5514533 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5514534 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5514535 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5514536 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5514537 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5514538 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5514539 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5514540 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5514541 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5514542 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5514543 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5514544 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5514545 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5514546 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5514547 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5514548 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5514549 this figure is bound to increase as growing cities coincide with escalating food shortages to create a squeeze on agricultural water supply
5514550 while it may be theoretically forbidden it is unofficially tolerated
5514551 i am worried about the toxins especially heavy metals accumulating in foods like root crops
5514552 but often there is simply no other water in many ways it is a great use of the waste and the nutrients it contains
5514553 even without expensive infrastructure common sense measures can make wastewater irrigation safer
5514554 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5514555 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5514556 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5514557 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5514558 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5514559 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure
5514560 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community
5514561 it does need diverse members of society to be able to access the diverse members of society that they may have interest in
5514562 the service seeks to reflect the broad range of u k society which it serves
5514563 to be honest with you i feel hes playing games in his head like a little kid playing with toy soldiers
5514564 its clear the intent was to get attention by causing fear and unrest that there was a bomb in that location
5514565 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5514566 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too
5514567 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5514568 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5514569 you can see where the money is going an irrigation pump here a renovated home there
5514570 the government must listen to what the awakening councils have to say
5514571 they deserve that because of all the sacrifices they have made
5514572 holding the retirement age constant is a certain prescription for future financial problems
5514573 raising it to reflect increasing longevity would contribute to solving those problems
5514574 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
5514575 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5514576 this is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen
5514577 he has not had much life experience to get himself mature
5514578 the whale is closer to the kattegat a passageway to the north sea and therefore closer to its usual summer habitat the nutrient rich arctic waters
5514579 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world
5514580 are a priority of our nation so we think our thing is the best
5514581 i am shocked by this senseless and barbaric attack on one of our staff
5514582 he has done many many terrible things he blew up the french plane and he blew up the american plane and what does the bush administration do the bush administration is far more on the side of the libyans than it is as far as the victims of terrorism go though it talks a good line about caring about terrorism if they can make friends with moammar gadhafi because they want his oil then that tells you where they stand
5514583 its really sickening and its really dirty they are being very private and secretive about it
5514584 the settlement goes to both sides the settlement is for outstanding claims on the part of libya as well as the united states
5514585 i dont have any information on that but it has been established i have no information on what the financial agreement will be or the financial compensation that will be paid
5514586 condoleezza rice is going to libya to kiss gadhafis feet
5514587 so this is what has come he blew up an american plane and i am supposed to have faith in the government of this country
5514588 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
5514589 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
5514590 this is done after the murder of my innocent daughter and 270 people killed
5514591 gadhafi was the one who was behind the attack on that disco and reagan responded does that mean the republican administration is saying that ronald reagan and gadhafi are equivalent terrorists
5514592 maybe im such a purist when it comes to this that i dont care what image or pseudo image that these companies care so much about if the company can appreciate my image and want me then they probably see something why put up some image for show
5514593 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5514594 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5514595 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5514596 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5514597 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5514598 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5514599 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5514600 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5514601 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5514602 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5514603 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5514604 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5514605 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5514606 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5514607 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5514608 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5514609 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5514610 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5514611 unfortunately the simple act of dialing a phone number or sending a text message while driving can turn a trip to the grocerty store into a trip to the emergency room
5514612 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5514613 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5514614 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5514615 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5514616 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5514617 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5514618 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5514619 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5514620 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5514621 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5514622 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5514623 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5514624 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5514625 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5514626 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5514627 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5514628 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5514629 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5514630 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5514631 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5514632 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5514633 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5514634 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5514635 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5514636 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5514637 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5514638 not quite a bunny rabbit but not quite a dog either nor a bear or cat for that matter
5514639 fing fing but a real one not a toy one
5514640 my wife who has known from the beginning and children are aware of this situation
5514641 all matters concerning alexandra since her birth have been handled privately through counsel i am pleased to see alexandra at 18 doing so well and i applaud her mothers efforts and courage
5514642 i only met her once and she was 3 years old she was brought to me at a basketball clinic at a public school
5514643 i understand they are being besieged because she won her match today
5514644 i just focus on my tennis and let everyone else deal with all that
5514645 im quite oblivious to most of it i havent been reading any newspapers just playing tennis
5514646 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5514647 its our only choice to try to come to the field and win
5514648 his recovery had moved along more quickly than we thought
5514649 we still have to make sure that we protect him as far as not putting him at risk but hes doing well his strength is back and he feels good so were going to see how that goes
5514650 i think doucet will do a little bit more in practice than he did last week
5514651 i think hell be a little bit limited on some of the deep stuff so well have to control his reps a little bit but hopefully hell work his way back like anquan boldin did and hell be ready to go this week
5514652 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5514653 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5514654 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5514655 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey
5514656 i am quite surprised yes i have never been able to work out why gordon brown wants to be prime minister he clearly has wanted this job with a passion for the last 10 years and probably since he was in short trousers
5514657 but now that hes to use a cricketing metaphor at the crease its not clear why he wanted to do the job what he wanted to achieve
5514658 and i am surprised at the sort of rudderless and indecisive nature of his premiership but thats the cause of the collapse in labours popularity they dont appear to know where theyre going anymore
5514659 it is true that labour are still ahead of us in this area but their lead has been hugely reduced in the last two years
5514660 the privileges of the medical school can no longer be open to casual strollers from the highway it is necessary to install a doorkeeper who will by critical scrutiny ascertain the fitness of the applicant a necessity suggested in the first place but consideration for the candidate whose time and talents will serve him better in some other vocation if he be unfit for this and in the second by consideration for a public entitled to protection from those whom the very boldness of modern medical strategy equips with instruments that tremendously effective for good when rightly used are all the more terrible for harm if ignorantly or incompetently employed
5514661 usual routine his principle persecutor was the head of the american medical association and chief editor of the
5514662 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman applause now for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix
5514663 vai mas trabalhar fazer qualquer coisa de til para a sociedade
5514664 god so loved this world all of us he gave his only son jesus that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
5514665 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5514666 however with the unfortunate passing of both of her parents i believe betty represents west virginias best option to keep the states election division moving in a positive direction
5514667 this announcement came as a complete surprise to secretary ireland
5514668 the republican party already has a candidate for the office
5514669 in some areas as high as 60 percent were undecided
5514670 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5514671 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5514672 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5514673 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5514674 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5514675 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5514676 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5514677 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5514678 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5514679 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5514680 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5514681 made excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs
5514682 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5514683 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5514684 there are no remains and we cant identify him he must have suffered horrifically
5514685 hes as tame as he can be as i float him down the nile
5514686 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5514687 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5514688 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5514689 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
5514690 obviously now there is much tighter engineering opportunity to be much closer aligned with saps applications
5514691 we have to be realistic its one company so the openness has its limits
5514692 its easier to sell business objects to sap than to sell sap to business objects
5514693 the good news is at least for the first half of the year we are seen as an open and agnostic solution set
5514694 we feel we may have lost customers in the past because we may not have had the right solution weve got the right solution today
5514695 it is our religious custom not to touch our women so we cannot search females our female iraqi police will be extremely important to use at checkpoints and government buildings throughout the province
5514696 they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
5514697 are you going to fix this or are you just going to ignore it
5514698 at some point in life the worlds beauty becomes enough you dont have to photograph paint or even remember it it is enough
5514699 most cherished in this mundane world is a place without traffic truly in the midst of a city there can be mountain and forest
5514700 asked if there could be a tendency for some male personalities to become
5514701 a married deacon is a lot more comfortable with women the same barriers as for a priest dont exist it enriches the work of women and the initial screening takes care of men who cant cope with this
5514702 the deacon does not take over automatically in a parish if there is no priest there might be a better qualified laywoman
5514703 the internet king i wonder if he could provide faster nudity
5514704 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5514705 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5514706 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out
5514707 liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective it is a corrosive which eats away unity undermines cohesion causes apathy and creates dissension it robs the revolutionary ranks of compact organization and strict discipline prevents policies from being carried through and alienates the party organizations from the masses which the party leads it is an extremely bad tendency liberalism stems from petty bourgeois selfishness it places personal interests first and the interests of the revolution second and this gives rise to ideological political and organizational liberalism people who are liberals look upon the principles of marxism as abstract dogma they approve of marxism but are not prepared to practise it or to practise it in full they are not prepared to replace their liberalism by marxism these people have their marxism but they have their liberalism as well they talk marxism but practise liberalism they apply marxism to others but liberalism to themselves they keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each this is how the minds of certain people work liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and conflicts fundamentally with marxism it is negative and objectively has the effect of helping the enemy that is why the enemy welcomes its preservation in our midst such being its nature there should be no place for it in the ranks of the revolution we must use marxism which is positive in spirit to overcome liberalism which is negative a communist should have largeness of mind and he should be staunch and active looking upon the interests of the revolution as his very life and subordinating his personal interests to those of the revolution always and everywhere he should adhere to principle and wage a tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and actions so as to consolidate the collective life of the party and strengthen the ties between the party and the masses he should be more concerned about the party and the masses than about any private person and more concerned about others than about himself only thus can he be considered a communist all loyal honest active and upright communists must unite to oppose the liberal tendencies shown by certain people among us and set them on the right path this is one of the tasks on our ideological front
5514708 not if i have to cross that beach to get there
5514709 local newspapers across the country are reflecting the growing visibility of our lives and our commitments by opening their pages to these stories
5514710 when we seize that opportunity to share our milestones and celebrations we help americans see the diversity of our community and recognize the common ground that we share
5514711 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5514712 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5514713 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5514714 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5514715 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5514716 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5514717 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5514718 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5514719 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5514720 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5514721 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5514722 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5514723 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5514724 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5514725 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5514726 who are open to doing something on the production side
5514727 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5514728 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5514729 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5514730 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5514731 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5514732 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5514733 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5514734 os beb s tornaram me at mais ambiciosa encontrei uma nova inspira o

5514736 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5514737 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5514738 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5514739 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5514740 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5514741 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5514742 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5514756 why should hundreds of thousands of japanese learn english to deal with a few thousand
5514757 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5514758 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5514759 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5514760 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey

5514774 the water is draining but the rain that we had saturday was just too much at one time
5514775 were coming back to cleanem out and make sure theres no obstruction so we can properly drain this area
5514776 i hope that this will be fixed and we can sit back the next time theres a thunderstorm and say we dont have to fend for our lives and we dont have to be afraid anymore
5514777 im a full player as opposed to someone who sits on the sidelines
5514778 the goal that everybody has is to try to get this resolved
5514779 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5514780 lording it over the people michael newdow would be proud
5514781 i had faith that this eventually would happen its an incredible emotional experience to see two men i know and love finally get married
5514782 im really happy for them that theyre able to seal a union thats been long and wonderful they really love each other
5514783 people think of love as a feeling but feelings come and go
5514784 when you approach love as a commitment then you achieve permanence i reached a point when i realized this is a relationship i wanted to last
5514785 i remain very hopeful that voters in this state will understand that love and commitment fairness and equality are values important regardless of sexual orientation
5514786 were neighbors were friends and were co workers people know us and it would be awfully hard for folks to say we shouldnt have the right to love and have a commitment
5514787 we just feel it is really important for young people to get out and say how they feel about these issues and share their stories
5514788 but i appreciate they acknowledge it and it is a nice conversation piece
5514789 deber an quitarlos somos una ciudad que no requiere ste tipo de artefactos ya que las calles son angostas y tienen doble sentido no se pueden usar los dos carriles y si vienes como quinto de la fila ya no te da tiempo de pasar y se pierden minutos en la espera

5514791 you need to send a request before you can start following this person
5514792 even a live dog is better off than a dead lion
5514793 he brought me out into a spacious place he rescued me because he delighted in me
5514794 it is not good to eat too much honey nor is it honorable to seek ones own honor like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self control
5514795 a fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions
5514796 a fools lips bring him strife and his mouth invites a beating
5514797 a fools mouth is his undoing and his lips are a snare to his soul
5514798 he who answers before listening that is his folly and his shame
5514799 an offended brother is more unyielding than a fortified city
5514800 from the fruit of his mouth a mans stomach is filled with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied the tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit
5514801 even a live dog is better off than a dead lion
5514802 im sure its his wish to get as many turns as he can
5514803 sometimes they just flat dont know what to do do i shut down and sit down do i show up and treat how do you do that
5514804 they have never been part of a training room culture nor do they want to be
5514805 injuries happen its a part of football hell work hard to get back out and hell know when hes ready
5514806 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5514807 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5514808 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5514809 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5514810 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5514811 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5514812 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5514813 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5514814 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5514815 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5514816 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest

5514820 if it was a category 3 or 4 hurricane then wed be a lot more worried
5514821 ive seen as many people die in blob shaped storms

5514829 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5514830 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5514831 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5514832 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5514833 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5514834 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure
5514835 theyre trying to portray themselves as an open inclusive organization thats working for the good of the community

5514858 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5514859 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5514860 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5514861 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5514862 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5514863 for me this is a case about doing the right thing and being fair
5514864 not discriminating against people and doctors not playing the role of god saying because you are gay you are not worthy of having a child or a family
5514865 i did it not only for me my partner and my children but for other people coming after me so they dont have to go through the humiliation and frustration and abandonment as a patient
5514866 meg whitman the ceo of ebay meg whitman 12 years ago there were five employees today theyre 1 5 million people that make a living off ebay in america in the world its one of these great american success stories
5514867 his supporters have enthusiastically endorsed him for who he is not what he has done
5514868 however i need to make a decision in the next few months as to how i manage that since im running against john mccain which takes a lot of time if women take a moment to realize that on every issue important to women john mccain is not in their corner that would help them get over it

5514874 this graduation ceremony has even more significance for me coming as it does exactly 50 years after i first enrolled at otago university in zoology physics chemistry and botany
5514875 rather than reflecting on the 50 years past and although we cannot predict the future with absolute certainty there are three challenges of world wide significance that will need to be addressed global inequalities global warming and global colonisation
5514876 that does not necessarily mean abandoning deep learning in favour of broad learning but it does mean transcending the limitations of a system where the acquisition of knowledge is split into time worn subject domains

5514881 for those who are prone to getting dehydrated not taking a drink could be disastrous
5514882 if the average adult loses 3 4lb of fluid their performance is seriously impaired
5514883 if they lose 7lb which is possible in the heat they are likely to get cramps nausea and experience a 20 30 drop in endurance capacity
5514884 during intense or prolonged exercise the kidneys are unable to excrete fluid as efficiently as normal
5514885 in extreme cases water is retained especially in highly absorbent brain cells and the pressure causes the body to shut down its primary functions such as breathing and heart rate treatment involves a small volume of highly concentrated salt solution but it can be fatal
5514886 its surprising how little elite runners do drink they are able to run 26 2 miles at speed with very little fluid on board
5514887 a medicine that must be ingested to prevent heat illness and optimise sports performance i believe that the body is adapted for conditions of mild dehydration
5514888 we evolved from hunters we had to run and chase animals on the hot african plains we didnt have time to pause for a drink
5514889 physiologists developed an unproven hypothesis that to become even the slightest bit dehydrated during exercise would kill you the sports drinks industry then used this bad science to market their products

5515055 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5515056 at the moment the plan is in the very early processes
5515057 we have spoken to some organisations informally in the western isles but there is still a long road to go
5515058 attractions throughout the forth valley have links to some of the most important events and periods in scottish history
5515059 by supporting this project through the regional development challenge fund we are able to raise the profile of smaller exhibitions as well as promote a richer experience for visitors
5515060 it is great to see the areas museums galleries and ancient monuments working together in this way
5515061 support through life should be viewed as a positive thing not a weakness
5515062 people should just reach out and ask for help and not worry about the negative point of view associated with therapy
5515063 id say wed be hard pressed to find more than a dozen
5515064 if someone is suicidal today we could see him or her tomorrow and then make an appropriate referral wed definitely discuss and provide psychotherapy obviously were not going to put them on a three week waiting list
5515065 despite their love for all things kinky and naughty it is illegal in japan to show any private parts in japanese porn
5515066 there are literally thousands of gay japanese dvds for sale but all have blurred mosaics around the genitals which is a total turn off for most consumers as you can probably imagine the pent up demand is huge for uncensored japanese porn
5515067 not only is the title uncensored japanese but its also the same quality consumers have come to expect from the line weve sold more of this already in pre books than we did boykakkes first film in the first month showing that theyre really starting to build an audience i expect after all is said and done this film will be one of the best if not the best selling japanese gay films ever
5515068 tons of raunchy cum action hot asian boys and plenty of hardcore butt pounding asian action
5515069 i am thrilled to be a part of such as amazing team
5515070 working with javier and michelle is going to be an exciting venture that will prove beneficial for all of us
5515071 we are excited about erika joining our team shes the component that weve been missing
5515072 we know shes going to excel in her position and take dvsx to the next level
5515073 its a more detailed picture than you would get with an x ray at the dentists office
5515074 this will not have a negative effect on ferry operations
5515075 it will take about 30 seconds for an empty vehicle and about a minute and a half for a cluttered vehicle
5515076 if he says hes hauling watermelons and its a solid substance inside then somethings not right
5515077 for operational purposes we want to take as many images as we can
5515078 were a little remote but everything needs to be protected now its unfortunate that thats our life these days
5515079 this is just another military application adapted for civilian use that is being foisted upon us like so many other measures
5515080 its an abridgement of our right to be left alone
5515081 to look to the north is to see a vertigo of muck filled trenches spiraling towards the horizon not a tree in sight piles of the dead roast in fires that darken the sky blood red soil trmebles shaken by an approaching horde thousands of footmen walk in formation flanked by cavalry generals ride atop smoke spewing giants signaling maneuvers with colored flags bearing mothers standard her armies are endless but the legion steels itself the battle has raged for nearly a century all of meric is at stake
5515082 if labour are to have any hope of wooing the electorate then a change at the top may restore their fortunes but it is no magic bullet
5515083 and if labour chose a new leader he or she would have to work very hard to gain the publics confidence it would not come automatically
5515084 i dont think all is lost but this shows there needs to be a leadership challenge
5515085 we have got to do whatever it takes to win the next election whether that means changing policy or changing leadership
5515086 weve got two years to go and we have the opportunity to focus on what we need to do to get the trust of the british public
5515087 the transition from public sector to public service should be completed
5515088 nomination papers for leader and deputy leader should be issued to mps meps constituency labour parties and affiliated organisations
5515089 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza
5515090 if we can find effortless ways for people to make a difference we find
5515091 the water sharing agreement is a major health and safety victory for the city of new berlin
5515092 after being ordered by the state department of natural resources to resolve the threat posed by radium contaminated wells in the central third of new berlin or face substantial fines our engineers researched a number of alternatives repairing the system would cost many millions of dollars and purchasing water from racine or oak creek would not be cost effective at this time the agreement with the city of milwaukee is the best combination of cost and providing new berlin citizens with the safest healthiest water available
5515093 our joint and successful efforts such as passage of the great lakes compact and the water talks between our two cities show the good that can come from suburban and urban leaders finding ways to work cooperatively
5515094 the city of new berlin looks forward to finalizing these agreements with the city of milwaukee and to future positive partnerships
5515095 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5515096 now there is plug ins emax which has two outlets a big box outlet and an electronics store and in the next three months there are two major names coming into the market in the shape of carrefour and sharaf dg both of these companies have already started negotiations with suppliers
5515097 on top of that we are looking at the possibility of having a multi brand it business because footfall is converging and consumers are demanding choice
5515098 brands such as nash gulf and creative are really doing well at the moment
5515099 they want to see sub distributors with local stock who can take care of things like rma issues
5515100 i would urge vendors to consider bahrain as its own region
5515101 redington jumbo and emitac are still doing a lot of business in bahrain and they have staff here but vendors must also give bahrain independent country recognition
5515102 we have distributors and can manage relationships through them but we are constantly increasing the number of in country people
5515103 we have now opened satellite offices in oman and kuwait too and this means that bahrain in particular can call on the resources of the kuwait office
5515104 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5515105 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5515106 it happened two days ago he was trying to cross the bridge when a russian soldier at a checkpoint opened fire for no reason he was shot twice in the chest and once in the head we buried him the same day my father died fighting for the red army in the second world war and i served as a soviet guard on the turkish border i had never harmed russia why did they murder my son
5515107 we have come here from our village five kilometres away which had been destroyed
5515108 thank god the russians did not let the ossetians in but where is the georgian army and the georgian government we have russians driving around in tanks in our city
5515109 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to the children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think that the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble we do not believe that the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible
5515110 to be perfectly frank i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show
5515111 but im happy to say the episodes they sent to me were really engaging really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in i thought wow this will work
5515112 nothing as simple as having the genes of a serial killer
5515113 the character has been able to examine his own genetic profile and he discovers he has certain clusters of biological facts in common with criminals
5515114 its just one of the things that interested in him in the world of violent criminals
5515115 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5515116 however i browsed around on youtube and realized that both movies were coming out around the same time and when i read that eclipse had actually managed to kick deathly hallows off the top seller spot i swear a mini explosion happened somewhere inside of me

5515123 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5515124 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5515125 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
5515126 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5515127 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
5515128 its the most supremely resigned supremely weary fuck you to the outside world ive heard this year all apologies has the most gorgeous aching tune an emotionally draining ennui
5515129 dont expect anyone to help you at retirement not your children and certainly not the government
5515130 develop a relationship with an advisor who can gather and manage assets under one umbrella
5515131 the majority of boomers see their home as a major source of retirement income but with declining home values you cant look at it in an isolated basis
5515132 anything that gives you a return is potentially an investment
5515133 customers need to think about how much income theyll need in retirement
5515134 people in their 50s need to protect what theyve accumulated
5515135 a good point to remember is that diversity is the key when considering how to save or invest
5515136 cds are attractive to those who have a need for long term investment or guaranteed return they are more attractive to those who are looking for higher yields but need less access to their money
5515137 remember if youre 50 or over the government allows you to put more money away this is called a catch up contribution
5515138 they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5515139 ringling bros engages in these unlawful activities by routinely beating elephants to train them discipline them and keep them under control chaining them for long periods of time hitting them with sharp bull hooks breaking baby elephants with force to make them submissive and forcibly removing nursing baby elephants from their mothers before they are weaned with the use of ropes and chains
5515140 i think its immoral to have elephants traveling in every arena in the country with tuberculosis
5515141 about half of the elephants in each of the shows had tuberculosis and that the tuberculosis was an easily transmitted disease to individuals to human beings
5515142 i undertook a series of efforts to find out what pottker was doing and reported on the results of my work to mr feld
5515143 i was paid for this work by feld entertainment or its affiliates i prepared my reports in writing and presented them to mr feld in personal meetings
5515144 i was also asked to review reports from feld executive vice president richard froemming and his organizations based on their surveillance of and efforts to counter the activities of various animal rights groups
5515145 immediately upon learning about negative stories about ringling bros the animal issues department will put in place the rapid deployment force
5515146 the animal issues department will directly contact the editor news director armed with videos literature and other information the animal issues department head will demand a retraction or equal time and will work in concert with the grass roots campaign if the editor news director refuses the request legal will be informed to determine what recourses exist
5515147 all of a sudden my hair wasnt good enough my makeup wasnt good enough after 25 years of doing the news
5515148 leslie worked here for a number of years and did a fantastic job
5515149 we stand behind the stories as they aired there was a whole lot of attention given to their accuracy
5515150 to shovel this stuff into the public record and try to draw inferences from it or put it in out of context lends itself to all sorts of abuse the very kind of abuse that we contend took place on the san francisco television station last week
5515151 you can talk about the animal abuse but with a worldwide epidemic brewing id say the story is the tuberculosis
5515152 there are several alarming issues for epidemiologists drug resistance inability to diagnose if an elephant has been cured and disease spreading to handlers who work with them and to the public who attend circus performances
5515153 i dont know that anyone has asked the question im not sure anyone has ever tied it together
5515154 every elephant traveling with ringling has been exposed to tb and many of them have tb
5515155 to find a physician who would test the people in the circus to see if they had tuberculosis but who would destroy the records and not turn them in to the centers for disease control
5515156 shedding is when it can be passed to other elephants
5515157 what our trunk washes look for is a shedding of the bacteria
5515158 however there has been no proven case of tuberculosis bacterium being transmitted from elephants to humans
5515159 none of the elephants in our traveling unit have ever tested positive for tb
5515160 no none of our traveling elephants have ever tested positive for tb
5515161 moved from cec to blue unit just finished tb treatment
5515162 the court requested that the parties not discuss the specifics of the suit
5515163 investigation regarding allegations that ringling was using known tb infected animals in circus performances
5515164 government sanctioned abuse how the united states department of agriculture allows ringling bros circus to systematically mistreat elephants
5515165 although tuberculosis is an extremely contagious disease and ringlings elephants are publicly exhibited throughout the country including elephants that go in and out of both the breeding and retirement facilities the public has been kept completely in the dark about this investigation the agencys decision to override the conclusions of its own inspectors and investigators and the reasons this investigation was closed with no further action
5515166 this cozy relationship between the usda and ringling bros is going to be exposed during the trial
5515167 the united states department of agricultures final report of investigation concerning the incident concluded that benjamins trainers use of an ankus on benjamin created behavioral stress and trauma which precipitated in the physical harm and ultimate death of the animal on information and belief the routine beatings of benjamin were a contributing factor to his death
5515168 suddenly and without any signs of distress or struggle benjamin became unconscious and drowned
5515169 things are pretty much done on a case by case basis we try to work with a facility to come into compliance
5515170 from the videos i have seen so much of it is repackaged and old stuff that doesnt apply to us at all not at all
5515171 i have never seen a trainer use an ankus inappropriately
5515172 the circus is really good at creating the illusion of the happy performing elephants
5515173 so were asking the judge to enjoin them to stop them from using these practices
5515174 it is our considered opinion that elephants should not be used in circuses elephants in the wild roam over large areas and move considerable distances each day they are intelligent highly social animals with a complex system of communication elephants in circuses are bought and sold separated from companions confined chained and forced to stand for hours and frequently moved about in small compartments on trains or trucks they are required to perform behaviors never seen in nature
5515175 i see elephants and get to see them all day doing the most amazingly athletic things
5515176 you can separate the ones who want to do it from the ones who dont want to do it
5515177 good for the feld family that they support elephants from their births to their deaths
5515178 to have this issue aired in a public forum will be helpful for educating the public
5515179 in no way did i imagine the bulk of the evidence that would support our claims
5515180 theres no humane way to have a circus with elephants because it has to travel year round
5515181 if you take away the chains and the bull hooks an elephant isnt going to do anything
5515182 saw several of the other elephant handlers and trainers routinely beat the elephants including baby elephants and he saw then routinely hit and wound the elephants with sharp bull hooks
5515183 they all feel the storm should weaken over florida but some models have it staying over the warm waters of the gulf which could allow it to strengthen
5515184 which could prove interesting for us but that is not what they believe will happen
5515185 minor to heavy rains and maybe an isolated tornado threat

5515203 the boomer might need to take it to project level and set priorities and goals
5515204 we view it as a privilege to have the benefit of experience that comes with age
5515205 i have to be wise enough as my dad was to see there are many roads to be taken with the business
5515206 regardless of generation hows everyone going to work together successfully thats the question that needs to be asked
5515207 employers are struggling with recruiting qualified candidates and are worried about loss of skilled laborers and intellectual capital
5515208 boomers should think of this time of life as an opportunity for increased intimacy
5515209 the kids may be grown and they have more time to get more of what they want out of life
5515210 much of their validation comes from their work or the money they have in the bank so they may tend to lose touch with their partners but you need to make time for your relationship
5515211 when you do that youre saying to your partner youre a priority for me offner continues
5515212 people who lose romance and passion have lost a connection and that plays out in the bedroom we work at everything else and we need to work at our relationships too
5515213 most people dont realize that miserable couples and highly successful couples have equal number of conflicts
5515214 the difference is in how they approach conflict highly successful couples tend to be able to see the logic in each others positions even when they dont agree
5515215 voicing a dozen appreciative comments for every complaint the way they do during courtship
5515216 it takes courage to break out of predictable safe patterns
5515217 people are often afraid to do something different because theyre afraid of being rejected doing the same things in the same way sexually is comfortable but it can also be boring
5515218 try a different location a different position or a different time of day
5515219 when couples first meet theyre more creative and willing to take risks
5515220 this legislation will help americans save lives at the community level
5515221 if you suffer sudden cardiac arrest outside of a hospital you have a five percent chance of survival it doesnt have to be that way if we can train more americans in performing cpr and using aeds we can save more lives
5515222 establishing a national cpr and aed awareness week is an essential step towards ensuring that communities across the country are able to properly respond if tragedy strikes
5515223 the more we can do to educate our communities on how to conduct cpr and operate aeds the more lives we can save
5515224 7 head over to a college protest against america where you scream at people who are protesting in monosyllabic grunts
5515225 you wont see us crying we did everything we could
5515226 usually theres action in the medal race but this time there was nothing it was very relaxed
5515227 its like when a relative dies it takes a day or two to digest it and then the depression sets in

5515239 our universities are helping people in the florida workforce prepare for career changes and new opportunities
5515240 by giving them richer knowledge and training we are also helping our students insulate themselves against uncertainty in the job market
5515241 the course allows people to explore their career goals and interests and re examine their priorities
5515242 we have a real mix of residents in this area
5515243 were seeing a lot of people who may be stressed out with their current jobs or were downsized others just dont want to quit working and are looking to try something new or give back to the community through volunteering some boomers are retiring and realizing that it doesnt work financially or they just want to stay busy
5515244 a popular claim from the popular hosting providers is 99 or 99 9 server uptime but this often refers only to a server being powered on and doesnt account for network downtime real downtime can potentially be larger than the percentage guaranteed by the provider many providers tie uptime and accessibility into their own service level agreement or sla slas may or may not include refunds or reduced costs if performance goals are not met one must be extremely careful when selecting a new company and they should read all terms and conditions carefully a potential customer should also check out the web hosting companys acceptable use policy in order to avoid potential cancellation of services due to activities that are considered a violation

5515249 we had a day where no good news hit the tape and where there was a rekindling of these smoldering financial flames
5515250 the one consistent item that weve seen is that all the fires are being set by the roadside
5515251 in recent history this is the most amount of fires in such a short period
5515252 were just very mindful based on the number of incidents weve had and the lack of rainfall
5515253 were going to have to rely on the assistance of the public
5515254 it would be frequent park travelers who would recognize if something is out of the ordinary
5515255 if you want a third or fourth leg to our economy beside agriculture and tourism in the us it comes from a healthy venture capital market out of which comes the next generation of businesses
5515256 the reality is this will be a long term investment area
5515257 we have to move quick if we dont want people to take our technology
5515258 with the competition at the point it is now really to have a mass market offering you need scale we only have a couple of players in the market with that kind of scale and there may only be room for one more the cost is simply too high
5515259 even so when you invest that kind of money in adding equipment to exchanges the business case to do so requires you to get a certain market share within that exchange
5515260 there has been some speculation that the unbundlers may offer sort of wholesale to the second tier access seekers whether that comes to fruition is speculation at the moment
5515261 the company has said its important that we are different from a historic mining company
5515262 the best way to protect idahos environment and values is to work with companies instead of having an adversarial relationship
5515263 they said they were serious about being good neighbors here
5515264 its not as if this is a big open pit gold mine
5515265 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5515266 it gives us the opportunity to treat areas with natural fire that before we couldnt
5515267 the wind shifted and came out of the southeast and it went exactly where we didnt want it to go
5515268 the objective changed from wildland fire use to all out suppression
5515269 more forests are creating their implementation direction so well see this tool in use on more forests in the future
5515270 right now these things are creeping around cleaning up those heavy piles of downed material its going to create more grasses its going to reduce the risk of losing those stands

5515277 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5515278 is that it were going to hang him on that
5515279 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5515280 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5515281 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5515282 its been a really hard day for me and im just really happy that the charges stuck
5515283 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s
5515284 this plan will provide stability of the industrial base and continue the development of advanced surface ship technologies such as radar systems stealth magnetic and acoustic quieting and automated damage control

5515287 what if fuel should go up by a quarter in a period of a month or two
5515288 we might have to have some emergency response to that
5515289 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5515290 i dont really like it because it takes like 20 minutes to do it
5515291 when its a panic call theyre not thinking it through in that way
5515292 we are not spending more on fuel this year because were driving less
5515293 while we know this settlement will never ease the pain of those enduring enormous heartbreak it does bring years of court proceedings to an end
5515294 to have a fire inspector miss the foam on several occasions i just dont see how they would have survived the scrutiny of a trial
5515295 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burned and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million
5515296 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5515297 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5515298 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5515299 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5515300 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5515301 chris brummitt is an exceptional journalist with a deep passion for asia news
5515302 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5515303 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5515304 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5515305 sen jones has been a passionate advocate who has fought for working families and the underprivileged
5515306 used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage
5515307 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action
5515308 i can work with attila the hun if i have to
5515309 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5515310 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5515311 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5515312 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5515313 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5515314 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5515315 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5515316 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5515317 if she had nothing shed find something to give you
5515318 the differences are fairly wide we are not there yet
5515319 the view is that they would like everything to be settled before the deployment and our view is that we should proceed immediately with the monitors
5515320 this is a make or break situation for the osce
5515321 the ap is fortunate to have such a tough incisive editor with experience on three continents to lead its korean news operations
5515322 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5515323 a four year college education is statistically your best chance of achieving a livable income in society but just because thats true on average it doesnt mean that everyone achieves that to the same degree
5515324 students decide on college based on things like what does the fitness room look like or whats the size of the campus
5515325 generation debt why now is a terrible time to be young
5515326 you cant blame them because theres not a lot of frank talk about things like job placement rate
5515327 i didnt really know what i was doing with my degree or why i was there
5515328 a lot of the classes i had to take had nothing to do with my major and felt like filler now i have a job i love and i didnt need college to get it
5515329 students with more life experience have been out in the working world they know what they want to study and they usually understand what kind of salary gain theyll get
5515330 if borrowing is going to get you the education you need to succeed to be able to go full time and not have to drop out to earn money all of those things are still worth it
5515331 if thats the case odds are your investment will still pay off
5515332 podcasting blogs and self publishing new ways to reach audiences with your book

5515359 i dont kiss bitches like you i nut in their throats and let them go home and kiss their boyfriends
5515360 surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
5515361 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5515362 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5515363 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5515364 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5515365 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5515366 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5515367 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5515368 la situaci n no ha cambiado no vemos ninguna retirada
5515369 los tanques rusos destruyeron los coches de la polic a georgiana cuando los agentes de polic a georgianos les preguntaron qu hac an tan lejos de la zona de conflicto
5515370 lamentablemente tenemos informes de ambas partes hay acusaciones de ambos lados
5515371 i am very much contented in life i have my family i have my artist friends and i can still paint thats what i really want to keep on doing i see myself painting until my last breath
5515372 who cares what does it matter we should have never been there in the first place
5515373 it was an accident my thumb slipped off the hammer god knows i didnt mean it lets go back
5515374 are you crazy he was a townee they stick together lets go back to our compartment maybe well be safe there

5515376 green card marriage will pay 300 month total 15 000
5515377 id say its a fairly blatant example of marriage fraud
5515378 green card marriage will pay 300 month total 15 000
5515379 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5515380 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5515381 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5515382 the decision to bring back peace corps volunteers was not made lightly
5515383 we considered the security situation nationwide and we considered the capacity of liberia government institutions to work with us
5515384 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5515385 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5515386 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5515387 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5515388 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5515389 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5515390 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5515391 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5515392 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5515393 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5515394 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5515395 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5515396 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5515397 we think that operation sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in new york
5515398 time to maintain this information to enable us to check and see if any information has surfaced concerning a vehicle coming into the city
5515399 but i would submit this will be a much more advanced system than they have in place
5515400 tenemos que evitar lo peor y mantener la confianza inversionista
5515401 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
5515402 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
5515403 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions
5515404 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
5515405 i think it will have the cathartic effect that both sen clinton and sen obama are hoping to have
5515406 pay it forward now or we are shipping you out

5515410 i think its great that the delegation is represented by people of all walks of life socio economic backgrounds ages gender race sexual orientation i think its also a good picture of the whole state of minnesota
5515411 when we talk about diversity we talk about the fabric and kaleidoscope of what minnesota really represents
5515412 there was no impending collision there was no near miss despite what the armature video showed
5515413 he did not feel like he would safely cross the intersection so he stopped the bus knowing full well that the gate arm would come down on the top of the bus
5515414 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5515415 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5515416 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5515417 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5515418 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5515419 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5515420 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5515421 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5515422 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5515423 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5515424 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5515425 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5515426 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5515427 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5515428 theres just not enough people to work in the restaurants the pay is so much better
5515429 prices keep going up because they know they can get it
5515430 if youre in the market for a travel trailer good luck theyre flying off the lots
5515431 im having to shop in houston austin and san antonio to find one
5515432 please lord let there be another boom i promise i wont piss it away next time
5515433 this is a much more measured intelligent response than it was 25 years ago
5515434 the company has said its important that we are different from a historic mining company
5515435 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5515436 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5515437 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5515438 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5515439 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5515440 bush is despicable look at what he did to mccain in south carolina
5515441 now everything that he talks about is how much he suffered he was the fattest prisoner that got off the plane
5515442 respectfully im gonna disagree with you when it comes to mccain and his service i think his policies are terrible i think his service was honorable and i think he deserves respect for that
5515443 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5515444 my marriages collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to vietnam and i cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war the blame was entirely mine
5515445 to portray the failure of his marraige as a good faith
5515446 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5515447 mccain is just as vulnerable on the personal narrative thing but the press feels like itd be unfair and mean to drag the poor guys name through the mud
5515448 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5515449 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5515450 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5515451 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5515452 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5515453 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5515454 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5515455 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5515456 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5515457 the united states was playing china in baseball which was sort of weird because the chinese do not really play baseball the chinese are here because well they were already here the host country automatically qualifies in every sport
5515458 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5515459 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5515460 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5515461 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5515462 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5515463 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5515464 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5515465 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5515466 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5515467 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5515468 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5515469 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5515470 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5515471 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5515472 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5515473 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5515474 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5515475 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5515476 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5515477 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5515478 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5515479 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5515480 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5515481 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5515482 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5515483 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5515484 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5515485 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5515486 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5515487 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5515488 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5515489 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5515490 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5515491 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5515492 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5515493 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5515494 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5515495 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom
5515496 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and maybe in control strategies
5515497 the intention of the united states is to reduce russia to its minimum expression
5515498 the russians did what they had to do we recognize the courage of president dmitry medvedev we are with russia
5515499 on a clear path in the direction of nato membership

5515525 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california simply affirms the historic logical and reasonable definition of marriage and does not remove any benefits from other contractual arrangements
5515526 what has never changed is that marriage is the ideal relationship between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation and the continuation of the human race
5515527 discounts the biological and organic reality of marriage and how deeply embedded it is in our culture our language and our laws and ignores the common understanding of the word marriage
5515528 diminishes the word marriage to mean only a partnership a purely adult contractual arrangement for individuals over the age of 18 children if there are any are no longer a primary societal rationale for the institution
5515529 same sex unions are not the same as opposite sex unions
5515530 sexual complementarity as designed by nature but includes their ability to procreate
5515531 offer themselves to god as co creators of a new human being

5515539 the way you overcome spiritual inertia and produce spiritual momentum is by making tough decisions
5515540 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5515541 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5515542 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5515543 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

5515547 if it were any other president i think we would learn to live with iran
5515548 we are seeing the beginnings of a revolution in france
5515549 we shouldnt be overly concerned about the move to the left
5515550 the big transformation we are missing in the u s is how to harness the civilian power to help developing nations as opposed to military troops we havent done this in iraq we did in vietnam
5515551 if we try to give china and india the same standard of living we enjoy the results would be dramatic
5515552 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5515553 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5515554 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5515555 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5515556 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5515557 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5515558 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5515559 the value proposition of the 21st century is air and water
5515560 any major company should have an understanding of their carbon footprint
5515561 the smartest thing to do is cut as much carbon out of the atmosphere at the cheapest price
5515562 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5515563 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5515564 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5515565 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5515566 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5515567 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5515568 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5515569 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5515570 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5515571 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5515572 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5515573 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5515574 technology is to media companies what refrigeration was to coca cola
5515575 amazon didnt replace wal mart youtube wont replace original content
5515576 is your profile not attracting the number of friends youd like
5515577 it is hard to embrace change when that change is viewed as threatening

5515580 this has been a golden age for our industry but nothing continues to be golden forever
5515581 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5515582 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5515583 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5515584 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5515585 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5515586 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5515587 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5515588 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5515589 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5515590 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5515591 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5515592 by sylvia plath in which her character esther greenwood reflects upon a passage she has written
5515593 elaine sat on the breezeway in an old yellow nightgown of her mothers waiting for something to happen it was a sweltering morning in july and drops of sweat crawled down her back one by one like slow insects i leaned back and read what i had written it seemed lively enough and i was quite proud of the bit about the drops of sweat like insects only i had the dim impression id probably read it somewhere else a long time ago
5515594 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope
5515595 hello my name is zachary johson im a motion picture major and a junior

5515600 6 your business ill be quite frank with you i have some information to believe that you were behind centralpips com which was a scam but i am definitely not sure about it
5515601 yknow we used to be a beer and hot dog band now were with the wine and cheese set

5515603 it was a creative thing trying to write the song and we had a lot of fun doing it
5515604 were probably going to make a record eventually for some reason i dont know that anybody cares but as a storyteller you need a new story once in a while what you need is a new song to play in the set every so often and weve got that
5515605 if somebody writes a blues song fine if somebody writes a pop tune fine
5515606 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5515607 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5515608 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5515609 animal rights groups are entitled to their opinion but many people do not share this opinion and it is certainly not reflected in the rising global demand for fur
5515610 regrettably not everyone understands the difference between animal welfare which has the full commitment of our sector and animal rights which seeks to ban every animal use by man whether for food medical or scientific research clothing or companionship
5515611 what would you say if you were flying into memphis and they said you are about to land at isaac hayes international airport

5515614 thank god for isaac living 65 years and making a difference in our lives
5515615 hollywood didnt send its stars to us we sent our stars to them
5515616 isaac came from our culture he emanated our culture thats why he never lost his authenticity never lost his conviction
5515617 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5515618 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes

5515622 i was thinking about this the other day too i dont
5515623 i used to call them all girls under the age
5515624 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5515625 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5515626 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5515627 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
5515628 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
5515629 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
5515630 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
5515631 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
5515632 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was
5515633 the growing threat from swarms of jellyfish around britains coast i
5515634 it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply
5515635 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
5515636 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5515637 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5515638 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5515639 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5515640 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5515641 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5515642 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets
5515643 the outlook for household spending growth in northern ireland is looking more subdued now than at any time since the early 1990s
5515644 it took more than thirty hours of struggle with sending and resending to transmit buchanans equally brief telegram back to the queen
5515645 it reflected the engineering influence of william thomson instead of edward whitehouse and it would not fail the way the whitehouse cable had
5515646 an emergency meeting has taken place at stormont between ministers and relevant agencies in the aftermath of saturdays flooding
5515647 those affected could expect to receive around 1 000 in compensation but the figure has yet to be finalised councils will be notified of the scheme on monday so that people will be able to make applications
5515648 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock

5515650 this executive is incompetent its time they got with doing the job that they were set up to do its a very definite and a very emphatic no
5515651 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5515652 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5515653 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant
5515654 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
5515655 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
5515656 i say wait in line because theres 20 other guys that want to fight me
5515657 if you have a chance to make 2 million and a chance to make 10 million i mean you just look at that
5515658 what do you want to do i think hes starting to realize that i think he sort of realizes that a certain percent of the big pie is better than a 100 percent of the small pie i think he and his advisers are starting to recognize that
5515659 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them
5515660 but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5515661 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5515662 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5515663 you have stocks selling off and concerns continuing about the health of financial companies and this stokes the flight to quality bid for treasuries
5515664 the dollar is in a consolidative mode and with commodities up investors have taken that as an excuse to take the dollar lower
5515665 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5515666 the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone
5515667 obviously looking at it in hindsight we would do things differently today
5515668 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps those are the lessons learned
5515669 in hindsight it would have been useful to have saved it
5515670 the anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics
5515671 were trying it in a couple areas where we have older underground direct buried cables and its getting to the 25 30 year mark where were starting to see some failures in the cable
5515672 surrounding the copper conductor here this gray area is insulation and over time what will happen is you get cracks in the insulation and if the crack goes all the way through the power goes out
5515673 if you have a budget for 100 thousand dollars for replacement youre going to be able to treat a lot more cable
5515674 no way this is way better than playing blackjack for a day and a half

5515689 i do not want anyone from south dakota on my jury
5515690 had to go through what this fat old man goes through
5515691 i cannot imagine a magistrate or a judge anywhere in america who would have denied a request for a warrant in this situation referring to the denied request to search zacarias moussaouis computer in august 2001
5515692 i could come up with briefing memos not read in texas too but i wont because i am too polite
5515693 every cop i know thinks like jack bauer in 24
5515694 i am more worried about being blown up about a terrorist than having my privacy violated

5515700 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5515701 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal

5515703 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5515704 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5515705 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5515706 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5515707 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5515708 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5515709 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5515710 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5515711 to ignore the prosumer economy is like a pulmonary doctor looking at the right lung and ignoring the left
5515712 science is under attack these days from a variety of quarters
5515713 the future of economic development on the planet especially in impoverished countries relies on science

5515730 we warn against efforts by vested interest groups and clans who are fanning muslim christian enmity to preserve their monopoly of landholdings and political clout in mindanao religious conflict is being stirred to cover up the real nature of the mindanao conflict land grabbing and land monopoly by elite families and clans big business and tncs and mncs on one hand and landlessness and agrarian unrest of mindanao peasants regardless of their race or religion on the other
5515731 we condemn this us intervention as it derails genuine peace for the moro people and equates peace with the security agenda of the united states in mindanao and southeast asia the us has been forthright in admitting that it is involved in the peace process with the milf to rid mindanao of its self defined terrorists its strategic motive is to establish us foothold in oil natural gas mineral ore and agribusiness interests in the region
5515732 the people of mindanao especially the moro people should bear in mind the historical wrongs inflicted by the united states empire which continue today with its bogus war on terror us military deployment and economic plunder of natural resources that abound in moro territories
5515733 if only to salvage the document as an authentic instrument for bangsamoro self determination
5515734 we demand for a grassroots oriented and solidarity based process that is complementary and parallel to genuine peace negotiations where the moro people and their leaders can be given the opportunity to share their vision of self autonomy and right to self determination far from the need for political survival of the arroyo regime and the interventionism of the united states
5515735 she is mobilizing the countrys political and economic elite at the national and provincial levels to foment their deep seated anti moro chauvinism to justify the current military offensives and enforced displacement of over 150 000 moro and non moro people

5515741 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

5515750 para pelaku bidah adalah orang orang yang mengikuti hawa nafsu dan syubhat
5515751 dan siapakah yang lebih sesat daripada orang yang mengikuti hawa nafsunya dengan tidak mendapatkan petunjuk dari allah
5515752 bidah lebih di cintai oleh iblis dari pada perbuatan maksiat orang terkadang bertaubat dari maksiat tetapi seseorang sulit bertaubat dari perbuatan bidahnya
5515753 tidaklah datang suatu tahun pada manusia melainkan mereka membuat bidah dan mematikan sunnah hingga bentuk bentuk bidah menjadi hidup dan sunnah menjadi mati
5515754 tidaklah suatu kaum membuat bidah dalam agama mereka melainkan allah subhanahu wa taala akan mencabut dari mereka sunnah yang sepadan dengan nya kemudian tidak akan mengembalikan kepada mereka sampai hari kiamat
5515755 hendaklah kamu menghindari apa yang baru di buat manusia dari bentuk bentuk bidah sebab agama tidak akan hilang dari hati seketika tetapi syaithan membuat bidah baru untuknya hingga iman keluar dari hati dan hampir hampir manusia meninggalkan apa yang telah di tetapkan allah

5515765 karena sesungguhnya ayat ini adalah makiyah turun sebelum peristiwa hijrah dari makkah ke madinah sebelum berbicara terhadap orang orang yahudi dan nashara dan sebelum adanya al hawarij kaum pertama pembuat bidah sama sekali
5515766 shahibu pelaku bidah tidaklah dia menambah kesungguhan puasa dan shalat kecuali dia semakin jauh dari allah dan dari ayyub as sikhtiyani dia berkata
5515767 barang siapa yang menyeru kepada petunjuk maka dia mendapatkan pahala sebagaimana pahala pahala yang mengikutinya hal itu tidak mengurangi pahala pahala mereka sedikitpun
5515768 sesungguhnya engkau tidak mengetahui apa yang mereka ada adakan secara baru setelahmu

5515785 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5515786 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5515787 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
5515788 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
5515789 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are

5515796 we are working on a new edition of the law that would allow entry into russia to be restricted for foreigner citizen debtors
5515797 we are not talking about restricting entry for political motives
5515798 taatilah saya selama saya taat kepada perintah allah dan rasulnya tetapi apabila saya melanggar perintah allah dan rasul maka gugurkanlah kesetiaanmu kepada saya
5515799 perumpamaan orang orang yang tidak beriman ialah seperti gembala yang meneriakkan ternaknya yang tidak mendengar selain suara panggilan dan seruan saja mereka tuli bisu dan buta sebab mereka tidak menggunakan akal pikiran
5515800 ayat ini jelas sekali menyebutkan bahwa taklid menerima begitu saja tanpa pertimbangan akal pikiran atau suatu pedoman ialah bawaan orang orang tidak beriman orang tidak bisa beriman kalau agamanya tidak disadari dengan akalnya tidak diketahuinya sendiri sampai dapat ia yakin kalau orang dibesarkan dengan biasa menerima begitu saja tanpa disadari dengan akal pikirannya maka dalam melakukan suatu perbuatan meskipun perbuatan yang baik tanpa diketahuinya benar dia bukan orang beriman dengan beriman bukan dimaksudkan supaya orang merendah rendahkan diri melakukan kebaikan seperti binatang yang hina tapi yang dimaksudkan supaya orang dapat meningkatkan daya akal pikirannya dapat meningkatkan diri dengan ilmu pengetahuan sehingga dalam berbuat kebaikan itu benar benar ia sadar bahwa kebaikannya itu memang berguna dapat diterima tuhan dalam meninggalkan kejahatan pun juga dia mengerti benar bahaya dan berapa jauhnya kejahatan itu akan membawa akibat
5515801 bahwasanya dalam penciptaan langit dan bumi dalam pergantian malam dan siang bahtera yang mengarungi lautan membawa apa yang berguna buat umat manusia dan apa yang diturunkan allah dari langit berupa air lalu dengan air itu dihidupkannya bumi yang sudah mati kering kemudian disebarkannya di bumi itu segala jenis hewan pengisaran angin dan awan yang dikemudikan dari antara langit dan bumi adalah tanda tanda akan keesaan dan kebesaran tuhan buat mereka yang menggunakan akal pikiran
5515802 dan sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah bumi yang mati kering kami hidupkan kembali dan kami keluarkan dari sana benih yang sebagian dapat dimakan disana kami adakan kebun kebun kurma dan palm dan anggur dan disana pula kami pancarkan mata air supaya dapat mereka makan buahnya semua itu bukan usaha tangan mereka kenapa mereka tidak berterima kasih maha suci yang telah menciptakan semua yang ditumbuhkan bumi berpasang pasangan dan dalam diri mereka sendiri serta segala apa yang tiada mereka ketahui juga sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah malam kami lepaskan siang maka mereka pun berada dalam kegelapan matahari pun beredar menurut ketetapan yang sudah ditentukan itulah ukuran dari yang maha kuasa dan maha tahu juga bulan sudah kami tentukan tempat tempatnya sampai ia kembali lagi seperti mayang yang sudah tua matahari tiada sepatutnya akan mengejar bulan dan malam pun tiada akan mendahului siang masing masing berjalan dalam peredarannya juga sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah turunan mereka yang kami angkut dalam kapal yang penuh muatan dan buat mereka kami ciptakan pula yang serupa yang dapat mereka kendarai kalau kami kehendaki kami karamkan mereka tiada penolong lagi buat mereka juga mereka tak dapat diselamatkan kecuali dengan rahmat dari kami dan untuk memberikan kesenangan hidup sampai pada waktunya
5515803 mereka bertanya kepadamu tentang ruh jawablah ruh itu termasuk urusan tuhan pengetahuan yang diberikan kepada kamu itu hanya sedikit sekali
5515804 orang orang arab badwi itu berkata kami sudah beriman katakanlah kamu belum beriman tapi katakan saja kami sudah islam iman itu belum lagi masuk ke dalam hati kamu
5515805 tetapi sebenarnya tuhanlah yang berjasa kepada kamu karena kamu telah dibimbingnya kepada keimanan kalau kamu memang orang orang yang benar
5515806 dan apabila hamba hambaku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku maka katakan aku dekat aku mengabulkan permohonan orang yang bermohon apabila dia bermohon kepadaku maka sambutlah seruanku dan berimanlah kepadaku kalau kalau mereka terbimbing ke jalan yang lurus
5515807 dan carilah pertolongan tuhan dengan tabah dan dengan menjalankan sembahyang dan sembahyang itu memang berat kecuali bagi orang orang yang rendah hati kepada tuhan orang orang yang menyadari bahwa mereka akan bertemu dengan tuhan dan kepadanya mereka kembali
5515808 kebaikan itu bukanlah karena kamu menghadapkan muka ke arah timur dan barat tetapi kebaikan itu ialah orang yang sudah beriman kepada allah kepada hari kemudian malaikat malaikat kitab dan para nabi serta mengeluarkan harta yang dicintainya itu untuk kerabat kerabat anak anak yatim orang orang miskin dan orang terlantar dalam perjalanan orang orang yang meminta untuk melepaskan perbudakan mengerjakan sembahyang dan mengeluarkan zakat kemudian orang orang yang suka memenuhi janji bila berjanji orang orang yang tabah hati dalam menghadapi penderitaan dan kesulitan dan di waktu perang mereka itulah orang orang yang benar dan mereka itu orang orang yang dapat memelihara diri
5515809 orang orang beriman kepadamu telah diwajibkan berpuasa seperti yang sudah diwajibkan juga kepada mereka yang sebelum kamu supaya kamu bertakwa memelihara diri dari kejahatan
5515810 beberapa hari sudah ditentukan tetapi barangsiapa diantara kamu ada yang sakit atau sedang dalam perjalanan maka dapat diperhitungkan pada kesempatan lain dan buat orangorang yang sangat berat menjalankannya hendaknya ia membayar fid yah dengan memberi makan kepada orang rniskin dan barangsiapa mau mengerjakan kebaikan atas kemauan sendiri itu lebih baik buat dia dan bila kamu berpuasa itu lebih baik buat kamu kalau kamu mengerti
5515811 tetapi kebaikan itu ialah orang yang sudah beriman kepada allah kepada hari kemudian malaikat kitab dan para nabi mengeluarkan harta yang dicintainya itu kepada kerabat kerabat anak anak yatim orang orang miskin dan orang yang melepaskan perbudakan mengerjakan salat dan mengeluarkan zakat
5515812 kamu kerjakanlah sembahyang dan keluarkan pula zakat serta tundukkan kepala ruku bersama orang orang yang menundukkan kepala
5515813 beruntunglah orang orang yang sudah beriman mereka yang dengan khusyu mengerjakan sembahyang mereka yang menjauhkan diri dan percakapan yang tiada berguna dan mereka yang mengeluarkan zakat
5515814 tangkaplah orang itu dan belenggukanlah kemudian campakkan kedalam api menyala sesudah itu belitkan dengan rantai yang panjangnya tujuhpuluh hasta dahulu ia sungguh tidak beriman kepada allah yang maha besar juga tidak mendorong orang memberi makan orang miskin
5515815 mereka yang menafkahkan hartanya baik di waktu malam atau di waktu siang dengan sembunyi atau terang terangan mereka akan mendapat pahala dari tuhan tidak usah mereka takut juga jangan bersedih hati
5515816 bilamana kamu memperlihatkan sedekah itu itu memang baik sekali tetapi kalau pun kamu sembunyikan memberikannya kepada orang fakir maka itu pun lebih baik lagi buat kamu
5515817 perkataan yang baik dan pemberian maaf lebih baik daripada sedekah yang disertai hal hal yang tidak menyenangkan hati allah maha kaya dan maha penyantun orang orang beriman janganlah kamu hapuskan nilai sedekahmu itu dengan menyebut nyebutnya dan menyakiti hati orang
5515818 dengan kenikmatan yang telah diberikan allah kepadamu carilah kebahagiaan akhirat tapi jangan kaulupakan nasibmu dalam dunia ini berbuatlah kebaikan kepada orang lain seperti tuhan telah berbuat kebaikan kepadamu dan jangan engkau berbuat bencana di muka bumi ini allah sungguh tidak mencintai orang orang yang berbuat bencana
5515819 musim haji itu ialah dalam beberapa bulan yang sudah ditentukan barangsiapa sudah membulatkan niat selama bulan bulan itu hendak menunaikan ibadah haji maka tidak boleh ada suatu percakapan kotor perbuatan jahat dan berbantah bantahan selama dalam mengerjakan haji segala perbuatan baik yang kamu lakukan tuhan mengetahuinya bawalah perbekalanmu dan perbekalan yang paling baik ialah menjaga diri dari perbuatan hina patuhilah aku wahai orang orang yang berpikiran sehat
5515820 dan tuhanmu sudah memerintahkan jangan ada yang kamu sembah selain dia dan supaya berbuat baik kepada ibu bapa
5515821 tangkislah kejahatan itu dengan cara yang sebaik baiknya kami mengetahui apa yang mereka sebutkan
5515822 kebaikan dan kejahatan itu tidak sama tangkislah kejahatan itu dengan cara yang sebaik baiknya sehingga orang yang tadinya bermusuhan dengan engkau akan menjadi sahabat yang akrab sekali
5515823 apabila ada orang memberi salam penghormatan kepadamu balaslah dengan cara yang lebih baik atau setidak tidaknya dengan yang serupa
5515824 dan kalau kamu mengadakan pukulan pembalasan balaslah seperti yang mereka lakukan terhadap kamu tetapi kalau kamu tabah hati itulah yang paling baik bagi mereka yang berhati tabah sabar
5515825 mereka yang memakan riba tidak akan dapat berdiri kalau pun berdiri hanya akan seperti orang yang sudah kemasukan setan karena penyakit gila
5515826 setiap riba yang kamu lakukan untuk menambah harta orang lain dalam pandangan allah tidak akan dapat bertambah tetapi zakat yang kamu lakukan demi keridaan allah mereka itu yang akan mendapat balasan berlipat ganda
5515827 whether under the umbrella of lean efficiency sustainability green warehousing or conservation the qc enterprise produces some benefits that allow for tier one distributors to become more green and eco friendly
5515828 when distribution center operations evolve because of environmental and ethical pressure the qc enterprise will adapt as well as provide a cost effective solution since supply chain and distribution budgets are being stretched by the high cost of fuel a wcs eliminates costly inefficiencies which will improve the bottom line

5515836 the era of consoles defined by graphics and high production values is over sony and microsoft took the bet that prettier graphics would be the huge differentiating feature for their consoles they were wrong everybody expects things to look good so making it look 10 per cent better doesnt have a big impact on its value since thats changed we now live in an era where community defines the value of a game not production values so the community dynamics of an mmo are more valuable to a user than how good the graphics look
5515837 alex st john the era of graphics focused consoles are over and this is the last generation of consoles
5515838 the graphics no matter how good can be are already
5515839 if people have that type of attitude there its stupid

5515850 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5515876 the hygiene of digestion has to do with the quality and quantity of food eaten in the manner of eating it if the food is eaten too rapidly it will not be properly divided and when swallowed in coarse lumps the digestive fluids cannot readily act upon it on account of the insufficient mastication the saliva will be deficient in quantity and as a consequence the starch will not be well digested and the stomach will not secrete a sufficient amount of gastric juice it is not well to eat only soft or liquid food as we are likely to swallow it without proper chewing a considerable proportion of hard food which requires thorough mastication should be eaten at every meal drinking freely at meals is harmful as it not only encourages hasty eating but dilutes the gastric juice and thus lessens its activity the food should be chewed until sufficiently moistened by saliva to allow it to be swallowed when large quantities of fluid are taken into the stomach digestion does not begin until a considerable portion of the fluid has been absorbed if cold foods or drinks are taken with the meal such as ice cream ice water iced milk or tea the stomach is chilled and a long delay in the digestive process is occasioned the indians of brazil carefully abstain from drinking when eating and the same custom prevails among many other savage tribes eating between meals the habit of eating apples nuts fruits confectionery etc between meals is exceedingly harmful and certain to produce loss of appetite and indigestion the stomach as well as the muscles and other organs of the body requires rest the frequency with which meals should be taken depends somewhat upon the age and occupation of an individual infants take their food at short intervals and owing to its simple character are able to digest it very quickly adults should not take food oftener than three times a day and persons whose employment is sedentary say in many cases at least adopt with advantage the plan of the ancient greeks who ate but twice a day simplicity in diet taking too many kinds of food at a meal is a common fault which is often a cause of disease of the digestive organs those nations are the most hardy and enduring whose dietary is most simple the scotch peasantry live chiefly upon oatmeal the irish upon potatoes milk and oatmeal the italian upon peas beans macaroni and chestnuts yet all these are noted for remarkable health and endurance the natives of the canary islands an exceedingly well developed and vigorous race subsist almost chiefly upon a food which they call gofio consisting of parched grain coarsely ground in a mortar and mixed with water eating when tired it is not well to eat when exhausted by violent exercise as the system is not prepared to do the work of digestion well sleeping immediately after eating is also a harmful practice the process of digestion cannot well be performed during sleep and sleep is disturbed by the ineffective efforts of the digestive organs hence the well known evil effects of late suppers eating too much hasty eating is the greatest cause of over eating when one eats too rapidly the food is crowded into the stomach so fast that nature has no time to cry enough by taking away the appetite before too much has been eaten when an excess of food is taken it is likely to ferment or sour before it can be digested one who eats too much usually feels dull after eating
5515877 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them

5515886 after being ordered by the state department of natural resources to resolve the threat posed by radium contaminated wells in the central third of new berlin or face substantial fines our engineers researched a number of alternatives repairing the system would cost many millions of dollars and purchasing water from racine or oak creek would not be cost effective at this time the agreement with the city of milwaukee is the best combination of cost and providing new berlin citizens with the safest healthiest water available
5515887 our joint and successful efforts such as passage of the great lakes compact and the water talks between our two cities show the good that can come from suburban and urban leaders finding ways to work cooperatively

5515932 after only getting a bronze in oslo in 2024 i was determined
5515933 i had to be as strong as possible because i wanted to win that medal for my family and all the girls in my church quilting club back home
5515934 someday im going to grow up to be like my dad
5515935 wanna go to lunch or meet for a drink later today
5515936 because americans cram so much into their lives we tend to schedule our headaches we live on a sparse diet of promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect

5515940 hopefully at some point we would like to extend it thats where we are
5515941 its not easy for young people to come to our country it doesnt matter where they go they have to settle in get used to the culture get used to the dressing room and then you can see their development and feel for the place
5515942 things dont happen overnight its done by time and we hope that all the players we have settle here to have great careers at the club
5515943 i cant deny it was an important issue to keep him here
5515944 i know that no one is harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances
5515945 what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for
5515946 people have to understand one thing at the age of 18 i arrived at a dream club like manchester united it was a dream come true
5515947 but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do
5515948 i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on
5515949 people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
5515950 im very aware what this club has done for me ill be forever grateful manchester united and its fans can be sure that ill never forget them no matter what happens
5515951 theyre special and theyll always have a place in my heart
5515952 one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that manchester united would be fairly compensated
5515953 the figure mentioned which would have been a world record would be some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club at least in material terms
5515954 for a while i wanted united to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid
5515955 if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself
5515956 when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it
5515957 sir alex ferguson was always intransigent and denied any possibility of a transfer
5515958 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
5515959 he has been one of the most important people in my playing career not only because of what ive learnt and continue to learn from him in sporting terms but also in human ones as well
5515960 if it were humanly possible i would like to have him always by my side he has been like a second father to me
5515961 iniziamo la discesa verso il campionato dice il mister rossoblu massimiliano allegri la coppa un impegno importante che ci preparer sia a livello mentale che di concentrazione e comportamento e una gara da affrontare col giusto spirito altrimenti si rischiano delle brutte figure
5515962 le sensazioni sono buone abbiamo lavorato bene sul campo dobbiamo avere pi sicurezza nei nostri mezzi ma senza scivolare nella presunzione cosa mi piaciuto di pi i progressi nella gestione del possesso palla dobbiamo comunque migliorare sia singolarmente che a livello collettivo

5515964 it is time the international community helped ease israel out from its fantasy world where stone and concrete equals right and justice
5515965 it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important
5515966 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

5515969 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5515970 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5515971 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5515972 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5515973 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5515974 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform
5515975 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5515976 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5515977 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the second half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5515978 the public do have less patience with footballers because of the amount of money that can be earned
5515979 but when you step out onto the pitch it is not about money it is about pride in your performance just like any other sport
5515980 however the fact we get a hard time is partly our own fault
5515981 when someone makes a mistake people just say ah the footballers again
5515982 it is hard because footballers get thrown into the spotlight at a young age with not much life experience but we could do more
5515983 i have been cheering every british medal the same as everyone else
5515984 the difference is that rowers for instance have one or two championships a year footballers have to perform two or three times a week
5515985 if you got up at 4am to train your head would blow up you need to find a balance in your life
5515986 the money is there because it is a global game but people should concentrate more on the positive things like a thrilling champions league final or the title race
5515987 we need to improve and we need to stay cool and calm
5515988 it is pigeon steps we just need to go forward a little bit all the time
5515989 one week you are on top of the world the next you are at the bottom some players cope with that pressure better than others
5515990 it is a psychological barrier we need to get over
5515991 this wont happen every week there will be times when we dont play well but we need to feel even when things are going against us that we are going to win
5515992 results help that i remember how much it helped when we went 10 games unbeaten under sven goran eriksson
5515993 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5515994 that is nothing against becks as a captain i thought he was an unbelievable captain who was magnificent for his country but he was coming to an age when for me we needed a shaun wright phillips or an aaron lennon to come on on the right side just to change the game
5515995 john would have played every minute of every game he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5515996 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio they are both great players but john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone else
5515997 why has he not already chosen him maybe he doesnt know him as well as i do he may have been giving himself time to assess the situation you would have to ask him
5515998 if i had come from another country and was not too sure of the characters of the personnel i have got having only seen them on tv then maybe i would give myself the time and space by rotating the captaincy thats the only reason i can come up with
5515999 he has taken a blow we need to pick him up and get on with it when i saw him at liverpool he used to come on and was a super player and he certainly never let his country down so being left out was a sad day for peter
5516000 my fathers mother was born in dundee and so i was aware that i could play for scotland
5516001 but it was a big surprise when i heard i had been called up i thought it was a bit of a wind up i had only played one game for derby
5516002 however as soon as scotland came calling it was a very easy decision to get myself up here as soon as possible
5516003 it is an exciting time for me from playing league one football with forest this is completely different end of the scale
5516004 ive done well for derby in the last couple of games and i will keep pushing on from there
5516005 but as far as international football is concerned i havent had a taste of that in any age group so its going to be a whole new test for me
5516006 but its an opportunity im going to thrive on and i will try to show everyone what i can do because there are a lot of people who obviously havent heard of me
5516007 ive got a good left foot and the ability to take on players so im more of an entertaining player than a player who plays in a defensive role
5516008 its a very strong squad on paper and now we need to deliver a performance which indicates that strength
5516009 right across the board we have a strong squad and lot of players with experience of playing regularly in the premier league with their clubs
5516010 there is good team spirit and there are a lot of faces here who are familiar to this squad on top of that we have some new ones as well
5516011 but you can go through the squad and there are not too many names that people might think where is he playing his club football
5516012 we have sold out the last few under 21 games and there are not too many countries at this level who bring the crowds in and im including the likes of italy and germany
5516013 i think that is probably a testament to the quality of players on show
5516014 i think some for the players in the under 21 squad should be disappointed if they dont make the senior squad
5516015 but as soon as the squad is picked and if youre in the under 21 side you should be ready to roll your sleeves up and think i must do well in this squad
5516016 it is important that players view international football whether it be for the under 21 side or the seniors as an education
5516017 it is an opportunity to play in a different style and be alongside the best talent in the country
5516018 there are five of six boys who arguably could be in the senior squad but for them to sit on the bench against the czech republic for the senior squad is probably a bit counter productive
5516019 steven took a knock to his knee yesterday in training so as a precautionary measure we just thought it was better that he sit out the session this evening
5516020 we will review the situation tomorrow but the expectation at this stage is that he will resume training tomorrow
5516021 i was just 13 when one of my best friends brothers was about to sign a contract with leyton orient
5516022 but one day he was walking the streets saw a fight went over to help got stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5516023 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5516024 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again because of incidents that have happened
5516025 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to so it is important we get involved in something like this
5516026 i went to the same school as stephen and i will never forget when the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said he had been killed there was a sombre and chilling atmosphere
5516027 one day the guy was enjoying life and talking about his a levels and the next day he was gone he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
5516028 thankfully the headmaster at that school led a few campaigns highlighting knives and things like that and in hindsight we can all appreciate it
5516029 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives if you go to prison now it will be a step in the right direction
5516030 people need to know it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5516031 communities and youth centres also need to play a bigger part boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5516032 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting are campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5516033 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5516034 i was a bit disappointed in the way paul robinson was treated he had a couple of off games but i didnt think he deserved to get dropped because hed been playing reasonably well until then
5516035 the finger is always pointed at goalkeepers when they make a mistake and i think thats harsh when other players in front have probably made worse ones
5516036 hes got the talent given the chance hell probably come back to form you have to push it out of your mind
5516037 thats what my coach said to me back in my early days at chesterfield if you make a mistake youve got to get your concentration back straight away because therell be another shot or header coming in a few seconds
5516038 its not easy but hes got to completely forget about the errors hes made but its a new season
5516039 the one i like he looked a good goalkeeper is foster at manchester united
5516040 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5516041 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5516042 you would have to ask the club i have been trying to get into the team
5516043 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5516044 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5516045 we have spoken about it but at this time i dont think i will say too much more
5516046 theres no doubt i would like to go to a major tournament i havent been for a few years and that appeals to anyone
5516047 the disappointments of the last few tournaments thats in the back of your head and you would love to go to another world cup
5516048 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5516049 when i met the manager at the end of last season it changed my mind
5516050 i had the summer to think about it because it wasnt an easy decision it wasnt easy to quit
5516051 but when i met the manager i liked what i heard so i made that decision
5516052 he has got a lot of experience and just the way he was talking about certain things i suppose he persuaded me to come back
5516053 you have got to respect someone who has done well in management

5516082 i think its a fantastic win and a vindication for them because they felt they were good rowers they performed on a world stage

5516085 this employee is really not so much of a has been but more of a definite wont be
5516086 works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap
5516087 when she opens her mouth it seems that it is only to change feet

5516119 community has been a core element of both aol and netscape since their inception and will continue to be as the text on the site explains we wanted to give a more traditional portal alternative to the netscape users who requested it you can rest assured that social news will continue to be an important part of what we do
5516120 no doubt some members will jump ship but since the social news version of netscape launched more than a year ago most of the people with a yen for an old fashioned portal have already left certainly the 323 589 individuals as of this moment who have joined the community didnt do so simply to check the weather and headlines

5516150 if i see a need and can help in any way i will its just part of our lifestyle as a family

5516158 only one in five councils are using charging to the full potential not just to cover costs but to shape their area
5516159 reducing congestion improving levels of health and exercise encouraging the use of local shops
5516160 the practice of local authorities using excessive parking charges to raise revenue is killing town centres
5516161 the minister doesnt seem as though he knows what he is talking about
5516162 these proposals are diabolical in respect of enabling local high streets and local business to survive we have found that where high streets are surviving there is free parking and the minister should be aware of this
5516163 is mr healey then going to insist on all supermarkets charging for their car parking
5516164 it is up to local councils to make these decisions if they choose to do so it must not be used to make a profit and or as an alternative to cutting out waste and driving down expenditure
5516165 it is shocking that whitehall is pressing councils to use parking charges as a cash cow to raid the pockets of public you would have thought the excessive rises over the past decade in council tax would be enough
5516166 ministers are calling on councils to use to squeeze more money out of the public who are already struggling with the spiralling cost of living
5516167 the last thing taxpayers need is even more stealth taxes and charges
5516168 its outrageous that government ministers are going round in public claiming to understand the financial pressures people are under but behind closed doors they are urging councils to squeeze everyone for even more money
5516169 councils already raise far too much by charging for things that used to be included in return for council tax
5516170 when i debate the economic role of local government i always hear the argument for more freedoms and financial powers im always receptive and im looking at new funding tools at the moment
5516171 half of councils dont even have a clear policy on charging to guide their decisions on how to use their powers
5516172 local councils have to make tough choices between spending cuts council tax rises and charging fees
5516173 in certain parts of the country the money councils have received from central government will make it the worst settlement for a decade
5516174 that different councils have different charging policies should come as no surprise every area has its own unique issues and councils will rightly adopt charging policies to local circumstances
5516175 charges and fees would be better exercised through a buoyant open and progressive local tax system but under the current system councils are doing the best they can to put people first with the tools theyve got
5516176 drivers are already being hit with expensive fuel and the increased cost of a tax disc
5516177 if they arrive at their destination and find that they have to pay an extortionate amount they will vote with their wheels and go elsewhere
5516178 charging for a scarce resource is one way of allocating but city centres are in competition with out of town retail where parking is free
5516179 parking has always been a service to communities and not a revenue raiser
5516180 it was cool to win so i kind of wanted to celebrate in style
5516181 the guys at fox came up with the idea to run number one on my back and i ran it it was cool and it was a good day the first moto was a little tougher because i was actually a little nervous watching the gate on the line but once i got out there i felt good
5516182 when i got to the halfway point it said 33 or 34 seconds on the pit board and i still felt good so i just decided to see where i could end up
5516183 i came down on that first downhill and i was charging hard
5516184 i hit the brakes and i think i hit a wet spot because before i knew it i was laying on the ground and rolling down the hill it was super fast
5516185 but no im not going to ride a 450 this year i was actually just talking to mitch about a 125 back at the truck just for saturday practice just to do it
5516186 the track is a little sandier than i thought but you know that its going to get rough and there are going to be fast guys im just going to go out there and try to get a good start to set myself up for a good moto since yesterday saturday i feel a little more comfortable on the track a little more time on the bike and a little more time on the track helps but its going good so far
5516187 it definitely feels good washougal was my first win but the tracks are two different tracks ryan villopoto goes really well here and he showed it today he made that mistake in the second moto though and i was able to take the win from him it feels good to get another win
5516188 i think this week was easier the second moto of washougal ryan was on me the whole time and i really had to be on my game this week in the second moto i got out to the lead and tried to not lose much time i just had to ride to the checkers
5516189 yeah theyve been making the tracks a little smooth lately but i was really pumped on how the track was this weekend
5516190 i thought that we would go out in the second moto and it would be really flat but they did build us monorails everywhere those were pretty intense you almost had to duck your head because you were going so fast the track was rough and i think it was probably the roughest one yet
5516191 it was kind of one of those bitter sweet things
5516192 ive really been working really hard this year and i kind of fell into an opportunity to get a factory honda ride which has always been a big dream of mine to be on a factory team practice was going really well and i was looking to get on the podium which were my expectations set for myself because the bike really was giving me that much of an edge things were going really well and i was out there practicing and pushing it and i ended up crashing and injuring my shoulder

5516201 largely the brainchild of jason calacanis and brian alvey while much of the design and general direction of the site had been laid out prior to my involvement things really kicked off out at the viceroy hotel in santa monica california we discussed netscapes early role as a means of discovery for internet users current internet trends and the unfortunate tarnishing of the brand over the years it was clear that we all shared the same vision
5516202 that kind of schedule had its difficulties especially for a virtual team our hard deadline meant that we were launching no matter what even if that meant reductions in initial functionality and performance frustration stress and eventual exhaustion affected both anchors and developers alike when we launched though it was one of the greatest feelings in the world
5516203 the brand has returned to its role as a discovery mechanism for internet users of all demographics
5516204 the future for netscape looks very bright we will continue to develop great new products we will continue to listen to member feedback we will continue to develop our social news site which we believe will become the best of its kind on the web

5516206 this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5516207 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5516217 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
5516218 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer

5516318 why isnt barack obama doing better why after all that has happened does he have only a slim two or three point lead over john mccain according to an average of the recent polls why is he basically tied with his opponent when his party is so far ahead
5516319 this ability to stand apart accounts for his fantastic powers of observation and his skills as a writer and thinker it means that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in obamas eyes but it does make him hard to place
5516320 if obama is fully a member of any club and perhaps he isnt it is the club of smart post boomer meritocrats
5516321 so cautiously the country watches this should be a democratic wipeout but voters seem to be slow to trust a sojourner they cannot place

5516324 the larger context of this work is for all involved a now familiar one the swirling boundless techno rich always on 24 7 media landscape and cyberscape
5516325 if the world itself in all its complexity is the vital first reference point for all we do the answers to the huge questions it poses wont come from either a retreat into dogma or to an imaginary higher ground that holds the difficulty and irreducibility of the world at bay nor a complete accommodation to the flux that outsources judgment to the remorseless 24 7 cycle

5516439 in aceste cazuri ideea de familie paleste foarte mult copiii ajung sa creada ca parintii sint doar cei care le dau nastere si atit ceea ce nu constientizeaza parintii in aceste cazuri este ca cei mici au nevoie de un echilibru afectiv si material iar copiii pretuiesc dintre acestea doua mai mult iubirea parintilor

5516466 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5516467 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5516468 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5516469 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5516470 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5516471 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5516472 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5516473 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5516474 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5516475 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5516476 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5516477 thirty years ago 20 years ago we were the fruit pickers
5516478 we were the cotton chippers we did all this rural work we were the unskilled labourers in the rural industry
5516479 we created a false economy and then people got used to the idea of staying at home rather than actually going out and looking for work
5516480 and they did travel they used to move down to mildura they used to go out to moree they used to go all these areas doing the fruit picking doing the cotton chipping
5516481 the extension of the quarantining of welfare payments needs to be extended into the dole payments as well
5516482 we are told that bathurst and orange are two campuses of the one hospital therefore gwahs greater western area health service has a duty of care to ensure people are returned safely to the hospital they were admitted to
5516483 he was diagnosed at bathurst as having a broken back
5516484 with no orthopaedic support in bathurst and no one available to see him in orange that weekend he was rested here for 24 hours before being transported to orange
5516485 there he was advised that surgery would not be necessary but he must have total rest for six weeks
5516486 his elderly mother then had to collect him in her small car and drive him home
5516487 she had surgery in orange then spent three days there recovering without family support or access to a wheelchair
5516488 it is good news that these people were diagnosed and treated properly at bathurst but if we had the orthopaedic coverage a city of 38 000 people requires these things would never have happened
5516489 in the meantime there must be a better way of dealing with it
5516490 its also really sad that people wont complain because they are so afraid of retribution
5516491 greater western area health service has made a commitment to working with the bathurst health council in identifying and finding solutions to transport issues between nearby health facilities
5516492 gwahs is looking forward to working with the health council and other key community stakeholders to provide transport services which best provide for the needs of the community

5516501 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth chairman kevin mccann said
5516502 to bring all that forward was a just a little bit challenging in a sense chief executive grant king told investors

5516505 russian administration believes the united states may soon suffer from a serious political crisis
5516506 america is standing on the verge of a large scale crisis of its own existence
5516507 i would like to use this opportunity for an open and pragmatic conversation
5516508 russia is indeed stronger and able to assume greater responsibility for solving problems on a regional and global scale
5516509 the habit of resorting to force is increasing in such circumstances it is important to maintain restraint and to evaluate situations carefully
5516510 i am convinced that with the end of the cold war the underlying reasons for most of the bloc politics and bloc discipline simply disappeared
5516511 we simply cannot accept the attempts taking place in individual countries to highlight the civilizing liberating mission of the fascists and their accomplices
5516512 it is those states that have such a passion for rewriting history and domestic and foreign policies that are at the same time the most zealous advocates of illegal acts like the kosovo precedent and those same states are the ones who have become ultra nationalist in their policies harassing national minorities and denying rights to the so called stateless citizens in their countries
5516513 for us this task is particularly important since in many cases we are talking about abuses against russians and russian speaking populations and protecting and defending those rights is obviously one of our responsibilities
5516514 i have focused on these aspects because europe today needs a positive rather than negative agenda
5516515 that is why we proposed to conclude a new treaty on european security and to start this process at a european wide summit
5516516 a strategic partnership between russia and the eu could act as the so called cornerstone of a greater europe without dividing lines
5516517 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement that will end this conflict
5516518 anyone can be passionate but it takes real lovers to be silly

5516522 we are delighted that olympics athletes took the opportunity to download this unique album which conveys a message of hope and solidarity with the tibetan people as well as a commitment to freedom of expression that cannot be suppressed
5516523 are rallying together to denounce internet retailers that offer songs for tibet for purchase
5516524 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users and an official website at this time reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
5516525 papercheck has built a proprietary test that can quickly assess an applicants editing skills the test is composed of two parts the first part is a multiple choice grammatical and formatting examination the second is a practical editing exercise the test is constantly altered to avoid the possibility of being compromised
5516526 the facebook application is a great accomplishment like many of our decisions to build new web applications the facebook application was actually a customer editor driven decision
5516527 papercheck customers are lifetime customers they grow with our company as they move from their academic careers to the business world

5516530 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5516531 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5516532 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5516533 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5516534 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5516535 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5516536 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5516537 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5516538 saya harap semua yang terbabit kegiatan itu hentikanlah tak ada erti cari populariti guna politik wang tak ada makna tidak tulen jika seseorang itu mendapat sokongan dan kemenangan kerana menggunakan politik wang
5516539 duit bukan ukuran kalau guna politik wang akhirnya kita akan kerugian lain kali masa depan kalau main politik wang orang kaya saja yang boleh pegang jawatan
5516540 orang yang tak kaya dan tak ada wang bukan tak boleh jadi pemimpin seolah olah dia tak boleh jadi pemimpin bukan kerana dia tak boleh jadi pemimpin tapi kerana dia tak gunakan wang
5516541 itu perkara penting yang dimaklumkan kerana ini perkara berkaitan peralihan kuasa

5516547 a type common to the darker nation smart ambitious well educated utterly dedicated to the romanticism of the long shattered civil rights movement living on the fringes of what remains
5516548 yes we can support a biracial ivy educated male lawyer candidate for the highest office in the nation
5516549 yes we can wage a social justice revolution in which everybody has health care the death penalty is considered an abomination and we wont bomb pakistan
5516550 what struck me was how few blacks are in the networks of the young professional types even democrats and progressive types we still have a long way before the fundamental sociocultural segregation of our society is relieved

5516556 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise
5516557 however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5516558 we have now spoken to several witnesses and built up a good description of the suspect
5516559 i would urge local people to read it carefully and think about anyone they know who fits the description given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally

5516563 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation
5516564 becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5516565 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for sometime and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase

5516567 this young couple were killed at the home they shared in newcastle thousands of miles from their families and the country of their birth
5516568 they leave behind distraught families and uncomprehending friends and no amount of speculation concerning their online activities should be allowed to obscure the fact that this was a happy young couple who had their futures snatched away from them

5516575 it is not politically motivated and has nothing to do with anwar the government has been working on this bill since 2001 it is ridiculous to attribute it to political motives
5516576 suspects have to give their dna samples it is compulsory
5516577 there is no law at present on this what we are doing is introducing a law to regulate and govern the taking of dna
5516578 i dont think they the opposition should attribute a sinister motive to it if there is a case in court and you are not guilty why should you worry about this bill
5516579 i did this when i was the education minister back in 1996 to open up opportunities for everyone to further their education

5516584 we are a major badminton nation but to remain as one there has to consistency in everything so far we have done reasonably well but i will not play politics and say that everything is perfect
5516585 there are so many areas that we can improve on and i mean both within bam and the states we have to improve our talent scouting methods of coaching and also how we bam support the players and coaches
5516586 we also have to contend with limited talent at the grassroots as we have to compete with so many other sports for talent from the same pool this is an area that needs to be sorted out
5516587 to succeed we need consistency implementation can improve as we go along but consistency in policies are very important
5516588 the same applies to bam and the state bas as a sport we may be world class but we arent in the management aspect so there is no consistency in the implementation of policies and this affects the running of programmes
5516589 badminton is a sport we are good in but to stay there we need assistance and i am not only talking about funding

5516609 the evidence showed khan was a committed and active supporter of al qaida ideology he had extensive amounts of the sort of information that a terrorist would need and use and the international contacts to pass it on
5516610 the prosecution case was that aabid khan was the link between sultan muhammed and hammaad khan police found the three had computer files and discs books documents and videos as the tools of their trade terrorism
5516611 there were not only items of propaganda but practical guides on making explosives and poisons and a particularly chilling step by step video guide of how to make a suicide vest
5516612 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5516613 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5516614 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaida and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5516615 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5516616 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5516617 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5516618 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4
5516619 pakistan is my love i have always tried to do by best for pakistan
5516620 im not scared about any charges sheet im not worried about any charge sheet no one can prove any allegations against me god willing

5516622 we have doubled our efforts and manpower to 200 members and 13 fire engines and are working round the clock at the scene
5516623 we are battling the blaze at both petrol tank farms while applying the cooling process on another tank which is located close to the first two tanks
5516624 the primary reason is that the hospital needed an influx of cash to grow our services the sale will enable us to do that
5516625 within a couple of months we hope to be breaking ground on the building of a new clinic
5516626 i already had global interests but that was when i left for rome a priest there took a group of us to the middle east for three weeks
5516627 i cultivated an interest that would last the rest of my life
5516628 i had thought about going into foreign service after i got my masters degree but korbel told me hed like me to consider the ph d track where i would be one of only 18 students
5516629 he also mentored condi rice in fact she became his ward
5516630 now think about that the first two women to be secretary of state and im sort of related to them through him
5516631 i had never been to oklahoma id been to no city smaller than denver
5516632 but i made a connection here immediately several vietnam veterans were among my students and they were about the same age as i was it was 1971 and they were all talking about what was happening abroad the class became a conduit for me we sat around and talked about these issues
5516633 we were trying to revitalize the campus in the 1980s the sequoyah institute was part of that concept
5516634 i helped create and execute the international conference on the question of palestine and joined the secretary generals office on palestinian affairs
5516635 i also established an international network of non governmental organizations which would be active in the mideast peace process after i left i was pro bono chair of those ngos that was the international coordinating committee on the question for palestine which would host strategy sessions and conferences around the world
5516636 but there are a number of reasons to be hopeful president bush and condoleeza rice have advocated the two state solution and if everything comes together at the right time it could work the u s will need to play a pivotal role but as long as were seen as being only interested in israel and not peace it will be difficult
5516637 eight months ago if youd asked me i would have said there was half of a 1 percent chance id be back at nsu because i was chancellor of a great system in wisconsin
5516638 but susanne and i are so pleased to be here its like watching a loop in our own lives come full circle i taught my first class in international studies in seminary hall and was as green as i could be and now im president of this institution so theres some symmetry
5516639 how many times do you get to be president of a university during its centennial i have an incredible appreciation for this acknowledgment of the past the women and men who founded this university were so persistent in their far sighted vision they established something that has endured and affected thousands of lives
5516640 this man had a tremendous impact on history with his kind of thinking and his story has to be told far and wide
5516641 i talked to some retirees who remembered that succession of people we brought in the economists journalists former presidents were going to do that again
5516642 those sorts of university initiated programs are good for communities and that is one reason were here to enrich the environment were the oldest educational institution in this part of the state and our work doesnt stop in the classroom we have to do our part to make the community a better place to live that means a partnership and collaboration with the city cherokee nation the chamber of commerce et cetera
5516643 with the state of funding and the rising cost of living we cant survive on what the state gives us we must supplement our funding with public and private resources
5516644 our model is a little difference from other regional universities its story is so compelling and exciting for the people of this state and i believe it could enjoy national distinction
5516645 we need to make the campus and its programs more vibrant
5516646 nsu has its historic roots here and here it will stay
5516647 were grounded in tahlequah our students on this campus dont go to broken arrow i see that as another outlet of support
5516648 with susanne what you see is what you get shes as genuine as they come
5516649 im fortunate to have her at my side weve been married almost 16 years and it just keeps getting better
5516650 if theres something going on shes not up there talking about it she in the midst of the people doing something
5516651 when youre a president of a university its more of a lifestyle than a job youre never not working
5516652 susanne and i both like to travel and we have strong international interests
5516653 and i became a kansas city chiefs fan because they had their summer camp on our campus in wisconsin
5516654 i enjoy all sports i put a strong emphasis on mind body development
5516655 one reason im so pleased to be back is that theres such a great team in place theyre dedicated to nsu

5516659 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5516660 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5516661 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5516662 we believe the old railway institute building would be ideal
5516663 however weve also formed a sub committee to identify a suitable location
5516664 from feedback were receiving theres definitely a need for a mens shed in bathurst
5516665 its not just a shed its a way for men to use shared skills in a big work area and to also have a chat and a cup of tea
5516666 traditionally men dont get together to share their problems so this is a way of addressing that as well
5516667 we will also be looking to council as well as state and federal governments for support

5516691 many journalists did their best they talked they wrote they talked they wrote our olympic committee our swim federation they said this is sport let her train and they said no i said i am just going to swim and they said no they didnt say anything they just ignored me
5516692 they said this is your dream these are the olympics you must train as best you can and im glad im here
5516693 but i tried my best and thats ok it has been my dream and i am excited to be here i dont think i will keep on swimming i have to concentrate on dentistry now but maybe ill keep on swimming for next time

5516696 here i do something i swim draw and build sand castles i feel sad when it is time to go home
5516697 at home i dont do anything but help my mother i feel bored all day but here i feel there isnt enough time in the day to practice everything
5516698 summer camp is much better than staying at home theres no place to play in our town so we always stay home but here we have so much to do i love the sea very much and i wish the camp lasted for a longer period of time
5516699 this two week camp hosts 224 girls from beit hanoun town aged between 6 and 12 years every morning they ride special buses from beit hanoun to the seashore to join the camp
5516700 the main goal of these programs and camps is to provide recreational opportunities and a place of release for the pressures experienced by gazan children on a daily basis moreover the camps promote childrens talents and creativity
5516701 our summer games bring joy happiness and hope into the lives of beit hanouns children those from marginalised and underprivileged areas are in most need of care and attention we ensure that problems related to stress can have an outlet through these exceptional programmes
5516702 three days later things started to take another direction as the girls became more calm and enjoyed the activities smiling and having fun
5516703 i like drawing very much here i build houses and shelters in the sand and swim with my friends all the time in beit hanoun people rarely go to the sea because of the difficult situation but here we are provided with everything
5516704 here i am very happy with my friends in summer games i hope it will be repeated many times i like swimming the most as well as building sandcastles
5516705 the children of gaza deserve and need an escape from the psychological trauma of their daily misery
5516706 it is so important to provide children with the opportunity that children in other countries often take for granted the potential for a better future will only be achieved if gazas younger generation is provided with the semblance of a normal life creative learning experiences room for self expression and opportunities to develop their skills

5516719 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region
5516720 the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region the outcome there will determine whether we realize the grand ambition of a europe that is whole free and at peace
5516721 russia must make good on president medvedevs commitment to immediately withdraw russian troops to their positions before the current fighting began we also need a truly independent and international peacekeeping force in georgias conflict regions and we must help the people of georgia to rebuild their country and preserve its democratic institutions
5516722 when congress reconvenes i intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for 1 billion in emergency assistance for georgia with a substantial down payment on that aid to be included in the congress next supplemental spending bill
5516723 russias actions have already erased the possibility of advancing legislative efforts to promote u s russian partnership in the current congress including an agreement to allow for increased collaboration with russia on nuclear energy production and the repeal of the jackson vanik amendment which currently blocks the countrys integration into the world trade organization russias failure to keep its word and withdraw troops from georgia risks the countrys standing as part of the international community that is not the future the united states or europe want but it is the future russia may get if it does not stand down its forces and live up to its commitments

5516757 one day the angels came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came with them
5516758 from roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it
5516759 have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil
5516760 have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land but stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face
5516761 very well then everything he has is in your hands but on the man himself do not lay a finger
5516762 the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby and the sabeans attacked and carried them off they put the servants to the sword and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you
5516763 the fire of god fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you
5516764 the chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off they put the servants to the sword and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you

5516772 search me o god and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if there is any offensive way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
5516773 have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil
5516774 one day when jobs sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brothers house a messenger came to job and said
5516775 while he was still speaking another messenger came and said
5516776 while he was still speaking another messenger came and said
5516777 while he was still speaking yet another messenger came and said
5516778 at this job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head
5516779 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked i will depart the lord gave and the lord has taken away may the name of the lord be praised
5516780 the cosmic contest with the accuser is now over and job is restored no longer is there a reason for job to experience suffering unless he was sinful and deserved it which is not the case god does not allow us to suffer for no reason and even though the reason may be hidden in the mystery of his divine purpose never for us to know in this life we must trust in him as the god who does only what is right
5516781 then the lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up all the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god and they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship
5516782 i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land
5516783 and it will become calm i know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you
5516784 then they cried to the lord please do not let us die for taking this mans life do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you o lord have done as you pleased
5516785 and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
5516786 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
5516787 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater so is my word that goes out from my mouth it will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it

5516800 the mhra is keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter otc where it is safe to do so and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management we know many pharmacists are ready for this too making this medicine available from a pharmacy is a real example of how we are progressing and enabling people to play an active role in taking charge of their own healthcare

5516803 you have shown you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5516804 this complex and sensitive inquiry has been part of the largest investigation of its kind within the uk the success of the operation is very much down to the excellent working relationship between cleveland police ceop centre met police and cleveland crown prosecution service cps
5516805 he thompson was a senior administrator for a paedophile website todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5516806 id like to make it clear that these websites cannot be stumbled across by their very nature they are hidden and people are directed to them but what i want to re iterate is that people who visit these sites leave a trail and we will follow that trail and find them
5516807 the evidence showed that philip thomson had in his possession one of the largest collections of images of child abuse in the uk
5516808 i provided pre charge advice to cleveland police and decided that philip thompson should not face just one or two specimen charges relating to the images but a total of 27 charges to reflect the criminality of his behaviour and to give the court adequate sentencing powers
5516809 thompson was a critical piece of this jigsaw network he was the librarian warehouseman for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5516810 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5516811 ultimately helps our national security because right now were sending billions of dollars to some of the most hostile nations on earth
5516812 makes it more difficult for us to shape a foreign policy that is intelligent and is creating security for the long term
5516813 he spends a substantial amount of time providing strategic and policy advice to clients in renewable energy
5516814 that is what has always motivated him on this issue and will continue to determine his policy going forward
5516815 he wants to represent the united states of america and his policies are based on whats best for the country
5516816 with a number of associations and groups to orchestrate and coordinate their activities
5516817 he has a terrific policy staff and relies primarily on those key people to advise him on key issues whether energy or climate change or other things
5516818 we made a series of mistakes by not adopting a sustainable energy policy one of which is the subsidies for corn ethanol which i warned in iowa were going to destroy the market
5516819 if you want to take some of the pressure off this market the obvious thing to do is lower that tariff and let some brazilian ethanol come in
5516820 but one of the fundamental reasons biofuels policy is so out of whack with markets and reality is that interest group politics have been so dominant in the construction of the subsidies that support it
5516821 we want to evaluate all our energy subsidies to make sure that taxpayers are getting their moneys worth
5516822 reduce overall demand through conservation new technology and improved efficiency
5516823 it does not serve our national and economic security to replace imported oil with brazilian ethanol
5516824 would take a broader view of energy security and recognize the important role that ethanol plays
5516825 is that a fact or is it just a story
5516826 what is america if not the happy zone which right from the start has attracted the many elements from eugenics of the best european races where is the vital force of the white race located if not there
5516827 our solution was shabby we ruined both races by merging them the blacks have lost their admirable wild physical qualities and the whites have suffered the inevitable worsening of character as a consequence of the crossings among different races
5516828 blacks and mestizos will surpass the number of whites in this year of 2008 in brazil
5516829 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
5516830 if anybody wants to criticize this one earmark let them have at it
5516831 this is something that i think benefits the people of our county of our region and i am very proud to have the opportunity to assist in getting the federal government involved in helping the every day lives of our citizens
5516832 is what governments about and what government has to do to serve their people
5516833 this has been a serious pollution problem in fayette county and in the region and its something that very desperately needs to be fixed
5516834 unfortunately urban county government has been one of the biggest polluters in our community for too long a time
5516835 south elkhorn station has been the site of more overflows of raw sewage than any other overflow site in our community we just simply have had insufficient capacity to handle the flow during our wet weather periods
5516836 regardless of how long our legal proceedings may take we dont intend for those delays to delay our progress towards improving our environment
5516837 to correct evasions in the law and to extend it to workplaces to protect more people
5516838 when lexington passed the law four years ago our law was the gold standard
5516839 but now around the country as well as kentucky those laws are more comprehensive than ours meaning they cover all workplaces and have fewer exceptions

5516844 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5516845 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5516846 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out
5516847 we will continue to relentlessly pursue those individuals who choose to trade access download and publish online child abuse images and child exploitation material

5516858 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
5516859 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
5516860 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
5516861 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
5516862 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
5516863 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
5516864 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
5516865 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
5516866 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
5516867 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
5516868 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

5516908 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5516909 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5516910 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5516911 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5516912 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5516913 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5516914 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5516915 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers

5516958 i would expect that to continue particularly because if you look at what inbev did when they bought labatt in 1995 they increased their spending but they spent a lot of it to reestablish and retell the brands story if in fact they do the same thing here in the u s theyll do the same thing and stress its still a part of the u s culture
5516959 so its not just online but cinema advertising video gaming a lot of ad channels that are not picked up clearly thats where young men spend their leisure time i think the shift to digital will be gradual theyre very successful and therefore i wouldnt expect them to do anything dramatically different from what theyve done

5517007 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5517049 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5517050 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5517051 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5517052 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5517053 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5517054 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5517055 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5517056 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5517057 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5517058 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5517059 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5517060 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5517061 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5517062 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about olin kreutz being our center and lance briggs being our linebacker

5517107 audrey came out with us but she wont be going back

5517109 she was afraid to go to her doctor because she didnt know how she would pay
5517110 we are excited about the new talent the department has been able to recruit to our team
5517111 in spite of the shortages of trauma surgeons in the u s we have been able to recruit these highly skilled surgeons because they see the endless potential for greatness in tucson
5517112 these new faculty are four more steps toward our vision of building the best academic and clinical trauma center in the southwest under rhees leadership
5517113 i know most of you here have sung my songs during karaoke sessions so feel free to sing along with me
5517114 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
5517115 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
5517116 early on i said i would cast my ballot for sen clinton
5517117 im going to cast my ballot for her and then the moment i cast my vote im going to continue to enthusiastically support sen obama its going to be a good release for all of us
5517118 the whole obama narrative is built around this narrative that obama and david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true so they have to be protective of the crown jewels
5517119 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5517120 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5517121 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5517122 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5517123 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5517124 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5517125 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5517126 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5517127 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5517128 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5517129 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5517130 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

5517133 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5517134 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5517135 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5517136 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5517137 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5517138 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5517139 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5517140 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5517141 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5517142 im such a big fan of those guys it makes total sense
5517143 he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her
5517144 its not fair to owen because he really cares for her and ends up getting hurt
5517145 kind of dark and moody like the work ive been involved in
5517146 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5517147 without hesitation we said he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5517148 i saw the first fireball and the helicopters go down
5517149 then about four other news choppers started circling the wreckage you could see they were jockeying for position
5517150 what words are there to express the pain and anguish when a senseless tragedy like this ruins a ratings bonanza like a high speed chase
5517151 i only hope that we can find solace when the overnights come out
5517152 everyone knows hes conservative and has come out strongly for the things that the pro family movement stands for but i dont think hes a christian at least thats my impression
5517153 the real question in this race is whether jesus is a fredist
5517154 we cant keep up with him almost as soon as we let go hes bounding down energetically with his arms and leg flailing and tumbling eventually we catch up finding him sprawled out quietly meditating at the foot of the slope his arms and legs twisted behind his back hes eternally youthful
5517155 killed no one but innocent civilians excersizing their 2nd amendment rights destroyed baby formula and medicine factories that im afraid are too dangerous for you to enter and inspect and damaged playgrounds where our children play in spider holes and underground bunkers
5517156 were watching what medicare is doing along with everyone in the country to see how this will develop
5517157 creo que a cualquiera le podr a haber pasado ni modo ahora a l le pas ahora lo tiene que superar y seguir adelante todo el equipo lo apoya todo el equipo est consciente de que esto pod a pasar entonces ya hay que levantar la cabeza y pensar en lo que viene
5517158 debemos de estar tranquilos se hizo buen partido el equipo est trabajando se hicieron bien las cosas l stima que no se pudieron concretar las posibilidades que tuvimos pero vamos por buen camino y vamos a hacer un buen torneo
5517159 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5517160 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5517161 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5517162 there have been misconceptions that taoism is a religion based on superstitious beliefs
5517163 we hope to let everyone have a glimpse of the history culture and philosophies in taoism practices
5517164 commitment to producing the works of william shakespeare and his contemporaries along with other classical theatre repertoire and the work of living playwrights
5517165 we havent simply come up with a list of plays and slotted people in we have encouraged artists to come forward with their own dream projects
5517166 he is certainly our greatest playwright but to truly know his work it is vital to explore the plays of his contemporaries which is why we present ben jonsons rollicking city comedy bartholomew fair
5517167 thats not hard to figure out at all our people in other countries know theyre missionaries their churches know theyre mission bases if we just applied here what we know there wed grow here again too
5517168 i will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5517169 the highest priority now is to secure the coastal towns
5517170 clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion
5517171 is a virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority
5517172 but if they are indeed trying to spin off that female pb
5517173 its going to be one of the best concerts youd ever been to
5517174 this song goes out to all women who have made a difference in the world
5517175 other countries and old rivals like australia now look to us as a country that got serious about sport and are now saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table
5517176 you need the funding to employ the best coaches and put the best systems and structures in place so you can get success on a consistent basis
5517177 weve put in place a system where people succeed but we cant be complacent
5517178 other countries are going to invest accordingly so weve got to step ahead of the game particularly as were hosting the games in 2012
5517179 we want to be successful as a nation and i think the performance of the team out here has inspired everyone and given us a performance we can be proud of
5517180 the medals are still clustered in a small group of sports such as cycling rowing equestrian and sailing contested mainly by the better off nations and in some cases by the better off individuals in those nations
5517181 the task now leading up to london 2012 is to increase the number of sports in which british athletes are genuine medal contenders
5517182 you saw that azizul wasnt outclassed he gave hoy a fight and that is all that we asked him to do
5517183 the cyclists will return to melbourne their training base after the hari raya holidays we have also decided to retain beasley as the cyclists are showing improvement
5517184 im not really thinking about tomorrow today to be honest this is just a relief more than anything else
5517185 we knew we were going to win but to actually do it while youre under a bit of pressure is just so great
5517186 we didnt realise what kind of time we had we thought we might beat the record but not by three seconds
5517187 i knew thered be a lot of world records but the depth of the great performances and competitiveness to win gold medals weve never seen anything quite like that before
5517188 this olympics was the fastest deepest most incredible olympics there has ever been
5517189 there were so many people from all the countries going fast
5517190 the number of gold medals were spread all over the world and the silver medals and bronze medals also spread over the world
5517191 they werent for slow times it was an incredible experience
5517192 hes a phenomenal athlete you have the absolute respect for his achievement
5517193 i dont know if ill still be alive when they stop talking about this bloke
5517194 you wonder if youll ever see someone as good as that again
5517195 today yesterday we had a very difficult game to play we tried to pressure them from the beginning to try to make them lose their concentration
5517196 in the second half china played a lot better they made easy shots they made a lot of threes and came back but we didnt lose our confidence we played calm and were not nervous and controlled the game at the end
5517197 if we should be able to play close from the beginning for sure yao ming should play
5517198 yao fought he wants to play and wants to help us as much as possible but he is a player and i am the coach i make those decisions
5517199 i guess what i dislike about the americans is that theyre very insular and a bit arrogant and theyre not aware that the rest of the world exists
5517200 but 10 years down the road because of the way the global economy is going this is going to change when they get a wake up call and start noticing the rest of the world
5517201 my favourite american city would be new orleans because id never been there id heard so much about it because of hurricane katrina
5517202 i find it extraordinary how theyre picking up the pieces within two years of the disaster despite the resource constraints
5517203 the way the disaster was handled it was as if it had happened in a developing country people were left to die in a football stadium for five days before the survivors were relocated to other parts of the country
5517204 the people didnt even know where they were going when they got on buses theyre still in makeshift homes today
5517205 its pretty much anti bush anti war which surprised me americans i thought like to kick ass and wanted blood for their 9 11 tragedy and humiliation but the mood has changed
5517206 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5517207 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the premier league or champions league well need more than this
5517208 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5517209 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style
5517210 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at middlesbrough the top four are on another level
5517211 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them to bring in crouch and defoe diarra i couldnt have asked for more
5517212 he is one of the best football players in the world
5517213 i like messi even though hes on the other team
5517214 when he gets the ball he is unbelievable argentina are better than brazil they have a modern passing game
5517215 many people think the olympics are not as important to us as the world cup but were brazil and every time we take to the pitch we do so to win we want to claim our countrys first gold medal in football
5517216 we have to play against everything we have to play to win theres no other way
5517217 if the opposition play open football against brazil then we can play open and pretty football
5517218 its the president of my country ive got to go
5517219 the great leader of dprk north korea and the people of dprk were waiting and i was very happy to send this happy news to them
5517220 im disappointed theres that fall that cheng fei made but i cant change her scores the judges made up their minds
5517221 the longest holiday ive had in the last few years was three days due to training now i can finally take a rest
5517222 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5517223 he has had a terrible spell with injury we are all disappointed for him but he will have to come back again
5517224 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and he is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5517225 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5517226 fifas decision was unfair and inhumane i dont consider that i did something so serious that i have to pay such a huge sum
5517227 erase the myth that french dishes are rich and fattening and meats are bad good food can only be made with good produce to guarantee that it is good prepare it yourself
5517228 everything is in your taste buds trust it listen to it there is no recipe that cannot evolve you prepare with your heart and your taste finally your hands
5517229 if you dont like pickled anchovies you can fry some ikan bilis for instance
5517230 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5517231 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5517232 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5517233 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5517234 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5517235 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5517236 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5517237 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5517238 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5517239 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5517240 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5517241 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5517242 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5517243 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5517244 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5517245 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5517246 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5517247 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5517248 obviously now there is much tighter engineering opportunity to be much closer aligned with saps applications
5517249 we have to be realistic its one company so the openness has its limits
5517250 its easier to sell business objects to sap than to sell sap to business objects
5517251 the good news is at least for the first half of the year we are seen as an open and agnostic solution set
5517252 we feel we may have lost customers in the past because we may not have had the right solution weve got the right solution today
5517253 nos preparamos bien y estuvimos cerca de la victoria pero as es el futbol no siempre el que juega mejor y domina es el que gana pero hay que darle la vuelta a la hoja y pensar ya en tecos
5517254 ellos han tenido un buen inicio de torneo pero nosotros hemos merecido un poco m s y ahora contra tecos ya es el momento de despegar es una buena oportunidad de reafirmar lo que hemos mostrado
5517255 es una plaza que ahora se ve m s complicada por el inicio de tecos pero esperamos seguir sacando buenos resultados y que ahora no sea la excepci n
5517256 el equipo se vio bien ejercimos m s dominio y por eso es que el empate es un tanto amargo
5517257 es un equipo que est enrachado y que por jugar en su casa ser m s complicado pero necaxa cada vez se ve mejor as que trataremos de proponer el partido y sacar la victoria
5517258 la verdad me siento muy bien en lo personal quiero agarrar mi nivel para buscar una oportunidad en selecci n pero hay que ir paso a paso y partido a partido desde mi llegada a tecos ste es mi mejor momento pero lo importante es que estoy colaborando con el equipo
5517259 es muy importante el despertar de robert de pinho hay que conocernos m s y entendernos de lo mejor para calificar estoy muy contento ac se ha armado un buen equipo y me ilusiona estar en una liguilla
5517260 este partido ante monterrey deja muy claro lo que es el sistema del profe trejo y lo que queremos as que hay que seguir en esa l nea el equipo hizo bien las cosas y la victoria es el resultado ahora hay que ser muy inteligentes para lo que venga
5517261 s me gust creo que fue un buen partido y una excelente oportunidad de ver al necaxa que pretendemos sobre todo en los ltimos veinte minutos del primer tiempo cuando le damos la vuelta al marcador el equipo funcion muy bien pero tenemos que seguir mejorando para ser m s constantes en cada partido
5517262 el empate no es malo aunque aspir bamos al triunfo chivas ven a con todo toda la semana dijeron que ramos un equipo marrullero ya les demostramos que no ya les ense amos quienes somos y creo que el 2 2 es justo
5517263 son un rival peligroso como todos no hay equipos peque os as que todos los partidos son complicados tecos est en buena racha se reforz bien as que vamos a estar muy atentos y ojal que el equipo salga con todo por el triunfo
5517264 ojal que le vaya bien yo creo que van a salir adelante ante un honduras que siempre se complica les deseo lo mejor sobre todo porque ah est paco ram rez quien est haciendo un buen trabajo m xico va a salir victorioso el mi rcoles en el azteca
5517265 obviamente estoy muy orgulloso es la primera vez que santos convoca a este gran n mero de jugadores y creo que lo merecen todos estamos dispuestos a hacer el sacrificio para aportar a nuestra selecci n nacional porque finalmente es el proyecto m s grande que tenemos en el pa s de futbol y yo s que estos guerreros van a aportar mucho a nuestro equipo nacional
5517266 yo creo que es un proceso muy bueno e interesante con grandes jugadores y muy abierto donde el se or eriksson est buscando llevar a los mejores y no por lo que dice el papel sino los mejores por lo que el mismo ha visto yo me qued muy satisfecho cuando tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo porque dijo que iba a visitar a todos los equipos en sus partidos y creo esa palabra la ha cumplido es importante que el platique con los t cnicos y los jugadores para poder sentirlo con su propia piel
5517267 tenemos confianza total y mientras todos confiemos y estemos unidos vamos a generar una vibra muy positiva de la que estoy seguro que nos va a dar muchas satisfacciones
5517268 el futbol es as no se nos hab a dado la posibilidad de ganar en la primeras fechas sin embargo el trabajo continu igual y la actitud del equipo de luchar de pelear a pesar de todas las lesiones e inconvenientes que hemos vivido en este torneo es muy gratificante tener estos tres puntos de ayer y poder retomar el camino a la senda del xito
5517269 siempre trabajando fuerte cuando hay confianza las cosas salen bien y ahora me toc ante monterrey un equipo fuerte que en su casa es fuerte y lo mejor es que ayud al equipo a atraer los tres puntos
5517270 no s qui n dijo esto pero el que lo dijo no entiende nada porque yo gracias a dios he conseguido mucho en el futbol y nada tienen que decir de m y menos en m xico donde respeto a todos y entonces no creo que la persona dijo no lo s pero estoy demostrando que estoy bien no he podido marcar en los primeros partidos pero ahora ya empec y espero que no pare y la confianza est al 100 por ciento
5517271 marcar gol es siempre importante me quedo muy contento cuando lo hago y m s cuando fue un partido dif cil como ste porque yo hab a dicho a lo largo de la semana que era el partido m s importante de mi vida y pude demostrar que f sicamente estoy bien y cuando salen los goles las cosas que dan bien y ahora tienen fe en mi muy grande y estoy muy contento
5517272 no con la volpe no tuve muchas oportunidades y jugu contra monterrey no contra la volpe al entrenador hay que respetarlo y yo ahora estoy en tecos y busco lo mejor para tecos
5517273 dentro del campo es una pelea y todos quieren ganar es una adrenalina alt sima pero tranquilo con sus expulsiones todo se nos volvi m s f cil presi n no hay entren bien y siempre hago goles siempre tengo la confianza del profe pues habla mucho conmigo
5517274 mantener la humildad de que podemos hacer muchas cosas m s si bien es cierto que no se jugo un buen partido pero lo importante y lo rescatable es que se sacaron los tres puntos que era lo que quer amos
5517275 uno nunca piensa que se puede arrancar de esta forma por lo dif cil y lo irregular que es el torneo pero nosotros sab amos que pod amos hacer una buena campa a por el equipo que tenemos y por la pretemporada que se hizo gracias a eso es que se ha tenido un buen arranque nadie nos ha regalado nada es m rito de todos nosotros estar en la posici n de arriba
5517276 uno trabaja pensando en la necesidad de cumplir con la esa regla sino por que el equipo lo necesita no dejando de lado de eso pues uno inicia jugando por eso motivos ahorita ya en estas circunstancias no debe de pensar en eso uno de debe de pensar que jugar por sus cualidades se puede llegara a mucha m s cosas
5517277 es una buen oportunidad para separarnos de ellos y ampliar los puntos que nos separan
5517278 la verdad que s es una victoria important sima despu s de un partido que se perdi le ganamos a un rival muy complicado que en casa siempre es fuerte as que estamos muy contentos igual que es sorpresa para la gente y para la prensa nosotros ten amos muy claro la forma en que se iba a dar el partido y la verdad creo que trabajamos bien el primero y segundo tiempo y sobre todo se fue contundentes
5517279 no s lo yo lo coment en la pretemporada se coment que quer amos olvidarnos pronto del tema del descenso y pensar en los primeros lugares es muy temprano el torneo pero es lo que se quiere en tecos
5517280 la temporada acaba de comenzar pero ya hemos empezado a sentir el traj n ante tigre perdimos un poco el rumbo nos desesperamos y eso nos complic el cansancio hizo que abus ramos del pelotazo ofensivo hay que serenarse
5517281 son conscientes de la gran oportunidad que tienen de participar en un torneo importante con equipos prestigiosos de la parte del continente donde el futbol es altamente competitivo
5517282 el motagua ha llegado a buenos aires con una gran ilusi n pero tambi n con la seguridad de que posee las condiciones para no desentonar en un torneo fuerte se ha preparado para eso y ojal los muchachos lo puedan mostrar
5517283 it relies solely on scientific knowledge and reason to identify our critical role in future evolution
5517284 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5517285 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5517286 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5517287 im a mother myself so i cant help but be concerned about you and care about getting you some help where is your mother
5517288 im just a drunk who got lost out here last night and couldnt find my way home are you going to charge me with an mip
5517289 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their toil for if they fall one will lift up his fellow but woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up
5517290 when i got hired i thought id get to wear pretty clothes and talk about whos sleeping with whom instead were talking religion sex guilt rejection loyalty greed there are some serious issues here
5517291 there were all sorts of rumors about why i didnt take it that i was quite arrogant about the whole thing it wasnt that at all it was again about wanting variety in my career thats not to say i wasnt grateful for the opportunity i genuinely was however i had to make a choice that felt right for me which was a difficult one especially as a young actor being offered a steady job
5517292 i think that there is something compelling about her sense of duty and her sense of getting the job done at whatever cost there is comfort in that in difficult times in times of war but people like that may be misguided
5517293 rezultatele aferente primului semestru din 2008 indica o piata a asigurarilor stabila si in continua dezvoltare fapt care in opinia mea reflecta inclusiv o incredere din ce in ce mai mare a consumatorilor de produse de asigurare
5517294 you know youre the first person to ever break out of sona
5517295 health benefits inspire a rush to the altar or divorce court
5517296 my coach is a jerk it was all my coachs decision
5517297 if i had competed in group a i would have won the gold
5517298 you can see my background is totally different i apologise to all the lifters im sorry but i had no control over it
5517299 i think that was the biggest mistake my coach has ever made
5517300 i love philosophy and i stick to tolstoys words that the major victory is the victory over yourself
5517301 continue to train to make progress but first i need a period of rehabilitation
5517302 sapiyev is aggressive always moving into attack so i was a little anxious
5517303 i got tired in the third round he attacked me in the corner and my coach yelled now the score is even try to hold him as long as you can i was worried
5517304 during the break after round three my coach said you have to push yourself because we have been waiting for this day i said next round whatever you want to say just yell it

5517318 donor support from internal and external sources also makes it possible to provide affordable services to everyone
5517319 for example the contraceptive stocks provided as a commodity grant by the internal planned parenthood foundation ippf are available at nominal rates while the government support for pap smear services makes the services affordable as well
5517320 the sessional doctors provide voluntary services and thus costs of services to clients are kept low making it affordable to all people
5517321 the feedback indicated that it is good for them to be able to access such educational programmes as they learn to take responsibility of their actions and more importantly know how to protect themselves from sexually transmitted disease such as hiv and to avoid unwanted pregnancies

5517334 we see a great synergy in bringing two of our successful sports marketing activities together
5517335 champ car racing and golf are both dramatic tension filled sports that require precision and complete focus from their competitors however champ car races are certainly a little more fast paced than any golf tournament ive ever seen
5517336 the bridgestone golf division is relatively new so creating a closer link to bridgestone firestone north american tire llc bfnt makes perfect sense for us
5517337 golfers are an appealing demographic that tend to buy high performance tires so we think bridgestone golf can be an effective way for bfnt to gain important brand exposure to a highly desirable consumer group working together will benefit both sides of the business
5517338 i think franck will continue to surprise many people this year
5517339 he was without a doubt the best driver in atlantics last season and i think he is a great addition to our team we knew before the test in sebring that we were signing franck for the year now everyone knows why we are so excited to secure him for 2008 the chemistry with franck is excellent and he is an experienced professional a pleasure to work with our focus is to take this team to the next level and franck will help us achieve that goal
5517340 conquest racing is committed to taking the next step up and adding franck to the line up is evidence of our desire to fight for the win every race weekend franck is an extremely talented driver and he has proved that in every series in which he has competed i think we can expect great things from him
5517341 this is a great moment and opportunity for me to be joining the champ car world series with a team like conquest racing
5517342 i want to again thank both eric and anthony blumberg for believing in my ability even though we had our eye on part of the 2 million team scholarship i am very grateful to my managers at cjmotorsport who were still able to put together a deal for me without it i cant wait for the upcoming test in laguna seca to get back behind the wheel again and continue my preparation for long beach
5517343 the team ended the day first and third so thats a good place to start sebring is kind of an enigma in itself so you cant take too much away from this but for the sake of the team and for the confidence of both me and david its a good place to start were looking forward to long beach more than anything weve got two tests still to go but we know weve got a good package underneath us now i just want to go racing
5517344 a lot of the teams have been here in their private testing in weeks previous to this test and we havent so we were a little bit behind when we first got here this morning this afternoon has been awesome its a new team for me joining sierra sierra this year and im just working on gelling with the team i cant tell you how excited i am to get to long beach and start the year
5517345 its a great confidence booster for our whole team we worked really hard in the preseason and to come to the first test and be quick its just a really good payoff the whole team is working really great and the car is doing what i want it to do so it speaks of good things for the team im looking forward to starting racing forsythe is such a big organization and everything is so well prepared you have so much confidence in the team im very happy to be here
5517346 its similar to setting up a small town for a weekend
5517347 with more than 175 000 people expected to attend theyll need everything from hospitality suites to rest rooms to trash containers to a hundred other little things
5517348 and thats only half our job come sunday night when the last race engine is switched off well take everything apart inspect it and start getting it all ready again for 2009
5517349 year in and year out dwight and his staff in conjunction with our suppliers and the city of long beach do a tremendous job constructing a circuit which is challenging for the drivers as well as providing a variety of spectacular viewing areas for our fans
5517350 they accomplish this while making a strong effort to minimize the impact on downtown businesses
5517351 it wasnt that we thought we were too good to run anymore or anything like that we accomplished what we needed to do what we set out to do and we didnt see much point in running around any more laps for us to finish today 1 2 i mean david was right behind me and i think we had really strong cars today its just such a huge boost for the team weve worked really hard in the preseason and for the first time running with everyone and for it to all come together like this and to end this test 1 2 its huge for everyone david did a great job both engineers are working really hard and the crew is awesome now were just looking forward to when it really counts in long beach
5517352 we made some improvements on the car reviewed data overnight and we were there james put in a very quick lap time and we were just under a 10th behind him its a good step forward for the team and we kept the momentum going from yesterday you cant ask for more from the team than to run 1 2 in the first test im extremely happy and really excited to get on with the season
5517353 the track has a lot of grip and its more physical that way especially with the bumps
5517354 its definitely more physical but the cars like it and theyre a lot of fun to drive a lot of times we come to sebring to test for street courses since it is bumpy and there are concrete patches now that youre here and theres so much grip it doesnt really simulate the first day especially of a street course it starts to simulate the second day a little bit but its still a little bit too grippy for that
5517355 it was a crescendo each session we were faster and we tested many things for all the phases of a race weekend and we did well in each so its good that we can already fight with the top guys
5517356 its a dream for all drivers to work with such a professional team i said it before and i will say it again this team can and will be competing for the championship i loved the experience and working with oriol servia was fantastic were quick and the team is happy we didnt have any problems throughout the test all we need now is to move forward and hopefully make the line up and if it does happen i think it would be a turning point in my career
5517357 im very very happy and very impressed with the team
5517358 we did the last race in mexico and we obviously had a good car they have been working hard all winter and all the new things they did they were better so im really happy the conditions today were nothing like you are going to find this season so we didnt really want to focus too much on the set up we just wanted to test and try things and thats what we did it was also good to have alex here to compare notes
5517359 its been good very nice to get back in the car after the off season we are testing a lot of new stuff to improve the car overall for the street courses this year and things are going well
5517360 when you arent sure about where youre going or how well youre doing relax becoming uptight worried skeptical or depressed is natural and to some degree healthy but dont let it drag on too long relax forget about your concerns and look around for someone else to help for awhile become concerned about their concerns and do what you can do to help them losing thought of yourself in helping others can do wonders for your own mental state
5517361 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5517362 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5517363 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5517364 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5517365 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5517366 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5517367 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5517368 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5517369 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
5517370 una feroz boca sucia de 11 a os que corta a los bandidos con una espada ninja
5517371 taxis on the road have been operating 24 hours a day for 23 years with two or three drivers each at one time
5517372 their suspension systems are destroyed the can separate from the steering shaft and accidents happen like falling into canals
5517373 you will see many of the older generation keeping their 20 year old stoves and refrigerators they bought when they got married
5517374 the traffic law has been overdue for a long time
5517375 there are a lot of very old vehicles on the road and that is a drag on economic performance
5517376 they will slaughter us how will i feed my kids
5517377 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5517378 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5517379 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5517380 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned
5517381 it might be a peaceful experience for people but its not for the whale
5517382 he was here in early spring and committed to me during a meeting that the department of fisheries and oceans would be looking to make changes in how nova scotia seal hunters could be licensed to make it easier for new hunters to get licenses since that commitment ive heard nothing from ottawa
5517383 its a big step forward to have the department of fisheries doing this i give the minister full credit for speaking out publicly in the media about the need to reduce the grey seal numbers and the need to do it on sable island we do need the higher quota and we do need access to sable island thats where the big herd is at and where its concentrated
5517384 as long as they say that publicly its very difficult to gain acceptance from the general public around the world about the need to reduce the numbers the scientists continue to ignore the impact of parasites in fish that come from grey seals that we know are killing the fish we have fishermen who are observing spawning fish being chased off spawning grounds by large number of grey seals
5517385 uneducated dimwitted people who came to town barefoot and married their cousin
5517386 that caricature like so much we think we remember about the famous monkey trial was largely wrong
5517387 and it would be all too easy to conclude from schneiders account here that dayton was a creationist set up
5517388 first ill ask whether schneider considers david berlinski to be a religious fundamentalist
5517389 nobody is calling for id to be taught in american public schools thats settled and its hard to see why it keeps coming up from anti id writers
5517390 while discovery institute does not support efforts to require emphasis mine the teaching of intelligent design in public schools
5517391 science education needs only high standards qualified teachers and access to lab equipment
5517392 if we the discovery institute view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree our strategy is intended to function as a wedge that while relatively small can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points
5517393 nobody believes that evolution has a sense of direction in which it is ultimately headed
5517394 they those at the di are encouraging schools to teach evolution more thoroughly included its evidential challenges
5517395 science is the pursuit of natural explanations for natural phenomena
5517396 it id suggests that nature displays hints of something beyond nature
5517397 error rests upon the lack of a crucial distinction namely intelligent designs failure to recognize or at the very least blur the distinction between science and philosophy both in ontology and methodology
5517398 science is the pursuit of knowledge of nature and of natural and supernatural explanations for natural phenomena
5517399 philosophical naturalism says that a supernatural explanation for neo darwinism doesnt matter it doesnt need evidence because neo darwinism is the only game in town so it must be true
5517400 science is the pursuit of knowledge of nature and of natural and supernatural explanations for natural phenomena
5517401 at what point can there no longer be a natural explanation
5517402 at what point can there no longer be a natural explanation
5517403 i threw berlinski in as an example of the fact that not all id proponents are fundamentalists not by any definition of the word
5517404 contrary to tom gilson not all atheists are genocidal dictators
5517405 first schneider misrepresented what the di did they did not withdraw their support just because they saw death in the looming
5517406 school boards have the authority to permit and even encourage teaching about design theory as an alternative to darwinian evolution and this includes the use of textbooks such as of pandas and people that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design
5517407 but from the start we just disagreed that this was a good place a good time and place to have this battle which is risky in the sense that theres a potential for rulings that this is somehow unconstitutional
5517408 early on seeing how the case would go the discovery institute withdrew its support
5517409 now if in your mind science knowledge and knowledge science then id most definitely would want to alter your version of
5517410 science can tell us what exists in nature and then we can gaspose think about what that means we can also consult knowledge from philosophy and theology with that combination of approaches we can draw our conclusions be they strong or tentative
5517411 will sucre let him go through with it now that gretchen knows who and where mari cruz is
5517412 stop throwing trash out the window its against the law there are trash cans all over the place go find one
5517413 as the secretary said many times before we have no plans to use the authority that weve been given so im not going to comment on any speculation
5517414 i used to drive you to your soccer tournaments and you were rude back then
5517415 en consecuencia todos los funcionarios que ocupan posiciones en virtud de decretos expedidos por el poder ejecutivo deben mantenerse en el ejercicio de las mismas cumpliendo con sus obligaciones y ejerciendo las facultades y atribuciones que el cargo respectivo les confiere
5517416 no everything is good for the first time in the car im quite happy everybody is very motivated inside the team i was at the factory working with the engineers the mechanics and everything was fine but you never know until you get in the car obviously things are going well we did everything we wanted to do so its cool i just hope i will stay in the car for the championship
5517417 sebring is not my favorite track it doesnt really show what the car can do however im pretty happy to see how things were going today we made a lot of improvement compared to yesterday when we were struggling a little the car was doing what i wanted at the end of the day it was just unfortunate that there was so much grip on the track it was almost not drivable but im happy and the team is doing a really good job
5517418 so far it is going very good we are doing a lot of developing of the car we are changing a lot of things and we are progressing testing things for the year champ car is cool its fun its a heavy powerful car and this is a bumpy track but its cool its different than what i have done before you never know when the turbo is going to kick in so you have to be ready for the oversteer
5517419 it is going well i think being away from single seaters for the last two years makes it hard at the beginning
5517420 everything is completely different we are making constant progress we are not yet where we want to be which is closer to the leaders but we are moving in that direction which is positive yesterday i did 103 laps so that was hard physically and today we should do about 100 laps but its going well without major problems and i am confident that with a little bit more work we can be more competitive
5517421 i was just learning to work with the team and learning the car i think everything is going as planned we will see how tomorrow goes but im pleased with what happened today
5517422 it was an interesting day a little hard physically though because since my last race in atlantic which was in august i only did one test back in november but i should be good by the end of the test
5517423 im a bit surprised to be honest to be at the top its a new track for me new people to work with and a new car but everybody did a really good job to get everything prepared the team is showing its potential and that it can fight for the top however today is only the first day and there is still a lot of testing time left but it feels good to be with the top guys
5517424 we didnt run new tires at the end so when you look at it like that i think we were second or third before everybody put tires on
5517425 the track is obviously pretty good and overall our cars are performing well right now and im happy because im never normally near the top in sebring so its good for me
5517426 i hadnt been in a car since november and in the morning session we were already third everything is going so well this team is so professional were working on different set ups for the car and they are very happy with the feedback im giving them its so much easier to work with a team when the chemistry is there right from the start and you dont have to build that up first i think this team will definitely be contending for the championship
5517427 certainly we need to keep learning as much as we can about the car and try to hone in on a good set up for myself and for justin
5517428 ill be the first to admit i struggled at sebring in the champ car it was quite a tough track for me but just go there and learn as much as we can its been a while since any of us have sat in the car and its going to be quite the change of pace from what ive been driving recently but im certainly looking forward to it
5517429 well to start with the first thing is getting used to the team getting used to the car and the environment
5517430 so the first test is all going to be about getting familiar with my environment and learning how to extract the most out of it so this is going to be a steep learning curve this first test then hopefully well learn a few things and move on from that in the next few months and you know find what suits my style and which bits are going to help us work best on the race weekend to go out there and win races
5517431 i was impressed by the team when i tested with them two years ago
5517432 unfortunately we were not able to get a deal together that year but i am excited to have the opportunity now
5517433 alex is a very competitive and capable driver that has consistently placed among the leaders in races and the championship standings over the years
5517434 testing alex in sebring will give pkv racing an opportunity to receive the benefit of his experience as we work through the various projects we have for this test in addition it will give us a chance to see how alex meshes with our team as we proceed with our search for a second driver
5517435 this is a team that is capable of winning the championship this year and it would be a dream come true for me to be with pkv in 2008
5517436 i think i can help them get to the top of the standings but first things first and that is to get our work done and have a good test in sebring after that we will see where things go from there
5517437 im very excited to be able to go to sebring with pacific coast motorsports
5517438 ive always been very fond of the team and i actually started my champ car career with their junior team so its a great feeling to be able to drive their car again
5517439 everybody knows champ car is huge in mexico and also among the hispanic community in the united states so im really looking forward to giving everybody a great result at this test and hopefully for the whole year
5517440 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5517441 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5517442 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5517443 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5517444 its mostly human rights for women were talking about here anyway
5517445 i would imagine there probably was a good reason to set up the equality authority when it was set up however maybe they have fulfilled whatever they set out to do
5517446 i do believe that that remit has been expanded to include anything that causes any displeasure to any woman in the country its about banging doors and throwing the odd tea cup or whatever you do its about a bad monday or a bad friday or whatever day of the week it happens to be sometimes
5517447 but the slamming of a door or the banging of the tea cup i would not interpret that as domestic violence
5517448 what we require right now is that verification package from north korea before we can go forward with the delisting
5517449 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
5517450 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization

5517452 the whale is closer to the kattegat a passageway to the north sea and therefore closer to its usual summer habitat the nutrient rich arctic waters
5517453 in the wild newborn dogfish are at risk from a variety of predators including adults of their own species
5517454 so this salmon like ability is probably a valuable defence mechanism
5517455 i was amazed id never heard of dogfish doing anything like this and no one else ive talked to has ever seen it before
5517456 within the space of about 20 minutes all six had jumped out again

5517459 oh i dont know really what i thought right then but i knew i had to get it out
5517460 he had to have it out and id do anything i could

5517493 river bottoms depend on where youre located on the river
5517494 ive been to the bahamas pleasure diving and you get down there and see all those nice fish and colors and its amazing but i always enjoy diving in these tributaries around here in the fresh water i kind of know what to expect
5517495 i position all the cranes first thing in the morning and feed workers the material barges they need or move barges to a different location these cranes might work in one location for a half hour then have to back up to one of the other thrust blocks
5517496 sometimes its busy as can be and you dont stop sometimes you have two or three hours without having to move anything and i just sit up here and listen to blues music
5517497 we start at 6 30 and end about 5 30 long days but its nice where else would you want to be than on the great kanawha river
5517498 there are good people on this river and a lot of good companies

5517500 during summer weekends i spend as much time as i can on the river i live at east bank mile 76 8 on the kanawha river ive got a dock there so i can actually do some of my diving there for the boats
5517501 im living the dream i want to be in to be part of about anything that takes place on this river i want to be able to tell people later that i helped put these walls up or that i helped build that riverbank or that dock or that pipeline river crossing
5517502 i see there are a lot of people in the industry who have degrees and they move ahead a little quicker
5517503 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5517504 the bottom line from our perspective is that the player has a contract which our rules obligate him to respect
5517505 our rules dont recognize a player or his new team being able to buy the way out of an existing contract its not a scenario that our existing rules contemplate or allow
5517506 we should forget emotions and we should start a new life with a transfer agreement in place
5517507 but without such an agreement if somebody will break the moratorium then it will be everybody could take any player and it will not be good for hockey

5517509 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5517510 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5517511 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5517512 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options

5517530 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5517531 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5517532 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5517544 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5517545 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5517546 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5517547 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago

5517562 i would like to congratulate the university of california santa barbara on making an excellent choice mark massari has a vision and drive to be successful and that enthusiasm is contagious among his staff
5517563 he was on the forefront of helping oregon state develop a campus wide strategic marketing plan that has helped brand the university nationally ucsb has hired a person who i consider to be a part of the next group of young talented athletic directors and i have no doubt he will be successful in leading the gauchos program
5517564 one of the brightest up and coming athletic administrators today
5517565 mark is a values driven person who will put the university and the students wellbeing first always
5517566 ucsb should be congratulated for hiring a very talented person in mark massari
5517567 he successfully managed a wide range of strategic and complex projects for us and i can say this without a doubt hes been a major factor in our success at oregon state his ability to lead and more importantly to produce is an outstanding combination he simply made us better our loss is truly ucsbs gain
5517568 if i can have half of the career hes had in athletics i will be a happy man
5517569 ever since i first recruited mark to play for us at sac st i knew he was going to be a great teammate and addition to our program
5517570 i remember mentioning to our head coach that his type of personality loyalty and attitude was what was needed for us to continue our foundation i enjoyed our four years together and the many years since ucsb made a great hire
5517571 every experience god gives us every person he puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only he can see
5517572 the irs is offering a type of amnesty to more than 45 companies that engaged in complex leasing transactions that the agency has challenged as abusive tax shelters an amnesty under which the firms would give up most of the tax benefits from the deals but avoid potential penalties the transactions are known as silos or lilos for sale in lease out or lease in lease out long popular with banks they involve companies buying or leasing assets outside the u s such as telephone networks or railroad and power systems then leasing them back to their original owners such arrangements created tax benefits for the u s companies which claimed depreciation expenses for the assets on their tax returns
5517573 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company

5517576 even if china goes from 25 to 15 year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5517577 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5517578 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5517579 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15
5517580 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5517581 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5517582 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5517583 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said

5517591 we also congratulate arianespace for another excellent launch campaign resulting in the accurate deployment of the amc 21 satellite
5517592 we need to harness the beginnings of a third wave of feminism a unified movement must include those who feminism has failed to reach in the past such as men many ethnic minority women working class women and young women
5517593 but for a really guilty pleasure i read conservative websites specifically i read mens rights activism sites and blogs and have ever since the eensy weensy that erupted on my blog a few months back i dont comment on them but i read them and i do not lightly dismiss them
5517594 ive noticed the same thing you have serin that mras have a broad range of political opinions on issues other than gender and feminism
5517595 im interested in these sites for several reasons not the least of which is the sucking vacuum created by the absence of logic in most of their arguments i also enjoy the back slapping atmosphere of boyish camaraderie and the grammatically adventurous venom unleashed on dissenters but beyond these small pleasures is the voyeuristic fascination of finding out how these people think and how they interact when theyre in groups of like minded people my point is not to expose these mens rights activists and anti feminists as hypocritical and misogynistic they accomplish that all by themselves what i find much more interesting is the systematic co opting of the language of oppression
5517596 im interested in these sites for several reasons not the least of which is the sucking vacuum created by the absence of logic in most of their arguments
5517597 feminism they say is a cult of victimhood and yet the anti feminists have codified their own list of victimization the catalog of anti male shaming tactics is a perennial favorite on mra sites
5517598 examples of the shaming language used by women feminists against anti feminist men include such phrases as youre bitter and you need to get over your anger at women to which the author proposes the response should be anger is a legitimate emotion in the face of injustice the inverse is not considered valid however angry bitter and bitchy women are not expressing legitimate emotion but are simply angry bitter and bitchy
5517599 code lavender is frequently found on mra blogs when male commenters dissent from the party line
5517600 the charge of misogyny is listed as a shaming tactic as to which the author says one may ask the accuser how does a pro male agenda become inherently anti female especially since feminists often claim that gains for men and women are
5517601 these blogs and websites represent a surprisingly large chunk of internet voices though not as large as say blogs devoted to star trek and they are for the most part very very angry the cdc hardly a feminist organization has a fact sheet on what they term intimate partner violence risk factors for being abused include for women having a greater education level than their partners dominance and control of the relationship by the male risk factors for being a perpetrator belief in strict gender roles e g male dominance and aggression in relationships desire for power and control in relationships dominance and control of the relationship by the male i certainly do not mean to suggest that any of the bloggers or site administrators listed above are abusers themselves but they are part of and feeding into a culture of anger and violence against women i read their blogs because as individual screeds they amuse me but i do not dismiss them because as a collective voice of aggression and hostility they bear watching
5517602 a combination of individual relational community and societal factors contribute to the risk of being a victim or perpetrator of ipv understanding these multilevel factors can help identify various points of prevention intervention
5517603 outside of ampersand most of the blogging is shrill estrogen laced histronics or hand wringing self flagellating exercises of male penitence ala hugo schwyzers blog yep i see a chick just fell from the nest
5517604 so now i am here to destroy feminism i will wage a pr campaign against them fight fire with fire and some day when they are no longer lodged inside the bum of the state i will physically drive them from this land i will to i stand besides these words and i will carry them out im one pissed off dude and i know exactly who the enemy is to my happiness insane feminism and their insane genes
5517605 if you refuse to have relationships with women then you are admitting defeat
5517606 you guys dont have it as nearly as bad as us women
5517607 im not interested in boys im interested in real men
5517608 men are shirking their god given responsibility to marry and bear children
5517609 so you are saying i shouldnt spend my money on myself but should instead spend it on a woman like you and you accuse me of being selfish just what were you planning to do for me anyway
5517610 how can you be so shallow and turn down a single mother
5517611 if you refuse to have relationships with women then you are admitting defeat
5517612 so now i am here to destroy feminism i will wage a pr campaign against them fight fire with fire and some day when they are no longer lodged inside the bum of the state i will physically drive them from this land i will to i stand besides these words and i will carry them out im one pissed off dude and i know exactly who the enemy is to my happiness insane feminism and their insane genes

5517636 when the clauses are taken at face value however giving all the words their normal usage then paul is saying no to their slogan as far as married partners are concerned
5517637 as throughout the paragraph the ordinary sense of words in their immediate context offers the best understanding of the sentence their
5517638 singular freedom from the desire or need of sexual fulfillment
5517639 but i say to the unmarried and to the widows it is good for them if they remain even as i am but if they cannot exercise self control let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion
5517640 for many later christians this has been the troubling verse
5517641 with an explanatory for paul appends a reason it is better to marry or to be married than to burn
5517642 in this case then paul is not so much offering marriage as the remedy for the sexual desire of enflamed youth which is the most common way of viewing the text but as the proper alternative for those who are already consumed by that desire and are sinning
5517643 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5517644 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5517648 this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5517649 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5517650 thats really the first thing we saw and hes in pretty good shape

5517662 this is a case where things will change from day to day
5517663 the place where you parallel park one day could be a lane for traffic the next day people need to pay attention because if your car is in the way well tow it at the owners expense
5517664 weve already seen where some people probably in a hurry to get to work or somewhere else have moved the barrels and not put them back
5517665 they need to realize that if the highway patrol catches them they can be cited for tampering with a work zone and they also need to realize that this roadwork is not a life sentence

5517671 this lets our partners create incremental revenue on top of hp servers our software and the services so that the blended margins become more exciting for them
5517672 from a channel perspective the solution is based on the needs of customers
5517673 we can leverage the relationship our customers already have with their preferred server vendors whether its dell hp or ibm
5517674 oftentimes customers pick a vendor for the support levels they get they dont want to deal with 10 different hardware vendors to support their environment
5517675 they can maintain the hardware platform they have invested in
5517676 thats a very significant factor in a customers decision making process

5517683 im not going to feel intimidated by some chick who comes in with a hammer because thats against the law its a criminal offence
5517684 i heard this woman coming on the bus screaming at the driver well why didnt you stop for me
5517685 she took the hammer out from the purse and she started hammering the driver i think it was around the drivers shoulders and chest after the attack she was bleeding from her fingernails so i guess she had covered her face
5517686 she was trying to punch me and she tried to bite me and you dont know who this woman is you dont know what she has
5517687 everybody was so scared because she had a big purse and i guess they worry she has a gun or something so i got up and i said whoevers got a cell phone call 9 1 1 and i went to the front to get my daughter off because she was so strong that little girl
5517688 im pretty muscular and just my voice and my attitude can intimidate people like this because theyre cowards
5517689 the woman was outside the bus knocking the windows knocking the doors i want my purse
5517690 they were so fast it was so great to see the police service and such action
5517691 she was shaking and i was holding her hand and saying youre not driving nowhere call the supervisor
5517692 the woman had been lying in wait at the bus stop her hammer at the ready
5517693 hey uh would you like to come do the movie

5517697 our article was targeted at young adults who plan to get married someday but who are not adequately preparing for it
5517698 living with your parents before you get married can be a very good thing
5517699 we have no problem with young people who feel called to forego marriage in order to better serve god they are not outcasts or oddballs obviously the apostle paul didnt think so however we do have a problem with young people who delay marriage out of self indulgence and sloth emphasis mine or because they think they can get the sexual benefits from a relationship without the responsibilities that accompany the commitment of marriage because we felt your post distracted from the message of the article by addressing what we view as an entirely different issue a straw man if you will it failed to meet the second criterion
5517700 in particular i note that several evangelical commentators believe god ordains a minority of souls to be single
5517701 because we felt that your post and blog is inconsistent with the values of our readers families and the purpose of our blog and because of concerns over the appropriateness of several websites linked to on your sidebar it failed to meet this third and final criterion
5517702 if a young mans excuse for foregoing marriage is as trivial as he doesnt want to mow the lawn well guess what
5517703 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5517704 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5517705 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5517706 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5517707 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring

5517719 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5517720 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5517721 i respect sen obama for his victory i respect his candidacy
5517722 and i will always have admiration for what hes been able to achieve but i can also tell you there are very stark differences for the future of this country and we will continue to draw them
5517723 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5517724 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5517725 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5517726 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5517727 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5517729 resolving the whither musharraf question may well allow the government in pakistan to now focus on issues of even greater urgency and immediacy like what is happening in the tribal areas
5517730 the new pakistani government may or may not prove to be as reliable of an ally in the global war on terror as president musharraf has been only time will tell
5517731 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5517732 whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists and prevent them from crossing the border in afghanistan and carrying out attacks and from attacking targets within pakistan

5517760 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5517761 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5517762 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future

5517774 everywhere my husband and i go we meet lovely christian women beautifully dressed deeply spiritual thoroughly feminine and single they long for marriage and children but what is it with the men are they blind to feminine pulchritude deaf to gods call numb to natural desire where are the holy men of god willing to shoulder the full responsibility of manhood to take the risks and make the sacrifices of courting and winning a wife marrying her and fathering children in obedience to the command to be fruitful while the church has been blessed by men willing to remain single for the sake of the kingdom and i do not regard lightly such men who are seriously called isnt it obvious that god calls most men to marriage by not marrying those whom he calls are disobeying him and thus are denying the women he meant for them to marry the privileges of being wife and mother

5517783 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5517784 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5517785 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5517786 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

5517793 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5517794 yo a party aint a party till its ran all through and leave it to my crew its gon be playa proof after three rounds we gon blow off this roof a party aint a party til its ran all through
5517795 i want to see the data i want to see the valid scientific links made
5517796 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5517797 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5517798 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5517799 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5517800 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5517801 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5517802 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5517803 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5517804 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5517805 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5517806 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5517807 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5517808 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5517809 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5517810 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5517811 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5517812 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5517813 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5517814 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit
5517815 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5517816 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5517817 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5517818 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5517819 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5517820 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5517821 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
5517822 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
5517823 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5517824 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
5517825 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5517826 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5517827 89 but i havent found anything so if anyone of you could help me out finding his other works id really appreciate that
5517828 we have wanted to develop this idea for several years
5517829 we knew we needed a unique format and the right host with the naked cowboy on board we have both
5517830 the naked cowboy is one of the most successful street performers in the country other shows have done a great job showcasing competition we plan to take a deeper dive with heart
5517831 ive weathered snow sleet and rain wearing only underwear in the most populated commercial real estate for over 10 years knowing that one day i would have a show of my own
5517832 i like this feast because it brings all the different italians together
5517833 friday night was a rain out we only sold about 255 of them
5517834 but we expect to sell about five to seven thousand over the weekend
5517835 this feast is a tradition and its about heritage love as well as the pride of being italian
5517836 we have a spaghetti dinner coming up and our christmas party
5517837 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
5517838 as part of general international law and customary international law
5517839 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5517840 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5517841 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
5517842 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
5517843 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
5517844 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
5517845 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
5517846 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
5517847 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
5517848 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
5517849 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
5517850 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
5517851 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
5517852 it makes us hungrier because we were on the top and now were not it humbles you and makes you ask yourself questions and challenge assumptions culturally its definitely changed us it makes us more aggressive and forces us to innovate
5517853 its about a 15 per cent decline in earnings and the company has to tell shareholders why it took so long to come to the market with the information
5517854 its purely based on the performance of the company its all about the companys net profit for the year
5517855 they need to sort out the overhanging issue of the pulp mill and concentrating on their asset base and improving it
5517856 there may well be pressure on him especially now with this decline in earnings to relinquish one of his roles
5517857 coming around the corner in the next one two or three years
5517858 if theres a final dividend of less than 8c youd have to say this stock would weaken even further
5517859 theres been a significant drop in earnings per share and for the third year in a row and you cant maintain that level of dividend
5517860 after looking at the x ray and consulting with our team doctors it was revealed that scott long suffered a broken bone in his foot and will have surgery in the next couple days to aide his recovery
5517861 im uncertain at this time how long he will be out of action
5517862 ive had players with similar injuries respond quickly and its my hope that scott can respond quickly in this instance we wish him a speedy recovery but we are lucky to have capable depth behind him to pick up the production in his absence
5517863 with the situation here i felt i needed to do something that was important to me i had a great experience at nc state and it was a special place for me over the last two and a half years the entire coaching staff and the support staff have been great to me i want to thank them and my teammates for being there for me i wish them all the best
5517864 justins a great kid and hes done a great job for our program hes decided to transfer to the university of louisville hes a great kid for our program and a great player
5517865 it has been the major driver of growth and has far exceeded what we expected
5517866 its a great product from our point of view because its very difficult for the large carriers to respond as it directly affects their pstn revenues
5517867 with the acquisition now complete we expect it achieve 2 5 million in synergies over the next financial year
5517868 its going to be at least a year before a decision is made on the national network and the government doesnt want a capital expenditure freeze for three to five years
5517869 the only way telcos can operate at the moment is by assuming the status quo and then dealing with the changes as they arrive
5517870 realistically by the time the nbn comes and starts being built most of the transition growth from dial up to broadband will be done
5517871 at that point the major differentiator will be deliverable product service and brand perception
5517872 this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5517873 we will continue to monitor the storm and its progress we will continue to consult with government agencies as well as the angels and the american league
5517874 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game silverman said
5517875 well monitor the weather throughout the day if theres going to be a call to postpone it likely would be made in the afternoon
5517876 tenham o plano pronto para tomar a pol cia de gu rico quando for necess rio diga ao comandante da pol cia que se atenha s conseq ncias mas n o vou permitir que essa pol cia ataque o povo de gu rico nem o governo nacional
5517877 se voc s tivessem que tomar com os gloriosos tanques do ex rcito a pol cia de gu rico far o isso a qualquer momento esperem a ordem n o vamos permitir que atentem contra o povo contra meus ministros
5517878 every now and then you get on facebook and you have people you see and youre like wow i went to school with them and they never said a single word to me and now theyre trying to be my friend i think its funny
5517879 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future

5517881 we are extremely gratified to have received these noteworthy awards from fitness management
5517882 the ten commandments of politics now began thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5517883 the market is closer to the actual outcome than the polls about 74 of the time
5517884 i have long said that the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5517885 u s policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaida and the taliban there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5517886 critical theater in countering the threat of al qaida and violent islamic extremism
5517887 i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5517888 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5517889 women think differently than men they will bring fresh ideas to how we conduct business
5517890 they are not iraqis they are not muslim it is not our way they are mad
5517891 it is a critical issue if it does pass the industry will be transformed
5517892 lets see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one
5517893 lets see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one
5517894 you are wise to keep your eyes wide open at all times
5517895 we want one but first tell us what it is
5517896 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
5517897 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet
5517898 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5517899 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5517900 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5517901 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5517902 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5517903 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5517904 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5517905 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5517906 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5517907 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5517908 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5517909 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5517910 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5517911 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5517912 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5517913 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5517914 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5517915 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5517916 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5517917 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5517918 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5517919 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5517920 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5517921 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5517922 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5517923 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5517924 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5517925 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5517926 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5517927 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5517928 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname
5517929 it just came up and people started talking to me and going hey bonus jonas and i was like hey whatever
5517930 hell tell it straight up and hell be mean if he needs to
5517931 once i got comfortable with having diabetes frankie used to call me pancreas boy but hes the cutest kid alive so he can get away with it
5517932 i remember sitting down with frankie and said nick is in the hospital and hell be home in a couple of days
5517933 it stood out for a new pac this was a big new pac you dont find many freshman who have a leadership pac like his

5517941 the word incites a response in those who members of the kingdom of god
5517942 other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil
5517943 and after the sun had risen it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away
5517944 other seed fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked it and it yielded no crop
5517945 other seeds fell into the good soil and as they grew up and increased they yielded a crop and produced thirty sixty and a hundredfold
5517946 to you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of god but those who are outside get everything in parables 12 so that while seeing they may see and not perceive and while hearing they may hear and not understand otherwise they might return and be forgiven
5517947 these are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown and when they hear immediately satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them
5517948 in a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places who when they hear the word immediately receive it with joy 17 and they have no firm root in themselves but are only temporary then when affliction or persecution arises because of the word immediately they fall away
5517949 and others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns these are the ones who have heard the word 19 but the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
5517950 and those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty sixty and a hundredfold
5517951 that cost about 28 million and has grossed 63 million dollars in over 2 weeks of release
5517952 and the 23 million it opened to and comparing it to
5517953 s tally of 26 million this weekend the numbers can be misleading and to some dissapointing
5517954 which raised its domestic total by 16 million to 471
5517955 will remain the 1 film in box office history for the time being
5517956 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5517957 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5517958 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5517959 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5517960 we had him a green room in a totally different building
5517961 mccain camp is whining because andrea mitchell reported that he was not in the
5517962 obama did poorly on that all gods children are created equal including jews buddhists and muslims as long as they accept jesus christ as their personal savior show starring that chubby gay cowboy fella from saddlebags mountain ergo mccain somehow penetrated the golden cone of silence
5517963 the primary area for all of this going on is west of the primary village and just south of the grand canyon corridor
5517964 within the grand canyon we have not received any known damage
5517965 but still if this comes to fruition want to bet the first episode has a scene that involves all the women taking a shower together
5517966 save yourselves from hell even if it be by giving only half a date of a palm tree as charity and one who does not have even that
5517967 do not consider even the smallest good deed as insignificant even meeting your brother is a good deed
5517968 every part of a persons body must perform a charity every day the sun comes up to act justly between two people is a charity to help a man with his mount lifting him onto it or hoisting his belongings onto it is charity every step you take to prayers is a charity and removing a harmful thing from the road is a charity
5517969 nimic nu m a pregatit pentru filmarea unui astfel de subiect nici macar stagiul militar

5517975 you wouldnt think about performing open heart surgery or even an appendectomy without years of training and education why would you think you could be successful at real estate investing without some training its kind of like the old axiom just because you can buy and sell something doesnt mean you should
5517976 she wanted to win and she would run so hard that after some of her races she just practically would lay down for three or four days
5517977 she would run very very hard and give it all she had every time
5517978 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5517979 we are truly blessed that she was a part of our life and we are deeply saddened by her passing
5517980 loved everything from the salmon and spring rolls to the grilled avocado sandwich everything is fresh and from scratch the owner chef is always
5517981 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5517982 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5517983 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5517984 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5517985 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5517986 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5517987 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5517988 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5517989 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5517990 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5517991 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5517992 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5517993 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5517994 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5517995 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5517996 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5517997 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5517998 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5517999 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5518000 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5518001 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future

5518064 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5518065 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

5518076 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5518077 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5518078 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

5518086 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5518087 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5518088 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

5518092 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part

5518103 last year 20 percent of subprime loans were delinquent and those types of loans continue to be adjusted upward we have the second highest foreclosure rate in the nation and notices of default continue to rise
5518104 by seeing an example of how much their monthly payment might increase homeowners will know months in advance what they can expect to pay in the next 90 to 120 days
5518105 families need more notice so they can better plan how they will make ends meet when their monthly mortgage payments rise
5518106 some might be able to rent out a room find a second job or seek other assistance if they dont have a clear understanding of how much their mortgage will adjust they get blindsided

5518112 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5518113 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5518114 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5518115 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5518116 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5518117 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5518118 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5518119 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5518120 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5518121 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5518122 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5518123 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework

5518139 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year

5518167 a mim n o me incomoda nada ter perdido a solidariedade de um clube e ter ganho a de outro porque n o preciso dela para nada nunca precisei e como treinador do vit ria a nica solidariedade que preciso a que me dada todos os dias pela minha direc o acho interessante que os clubes designados grandes andem atr s da solidariedade de outros clubes e que andem a correr de um lado para outro s para aparecerem na fotografia isso que eu acho engra ado mas se calhar neste pa s toda a gente acha isso normal o vit ria para ficar no seu lugar entre os primeiros lugares do campeonato n o precisa de ningu m a n o ser dos seus adeptos dos seus dirigentes e dos seus jogadores
5518168 este clube de facto muito grande ao ponto de outros clubes se encostarem a n s porque sentem que a nossa grandeza lhes pode ser til mas aten o que o vit ria grande sozinho n o precisa de companhias deste ou daquele para ser grande nunca precisou em 86 anos de hist ria n o precisa de alian as de amigos nem de inimigos e eu sei que a direc o pensa o mesmo esta direc o move se pelos interesses do clube e se numa dada altura eles s o coincidentes com outros clubes pois bem h um trabalho conjunto a fazer
5518169 o vit ria n o perde identidade nestas ocasi es como outros clubes que se agarram a estas alian as para poderem aparecer um bocadinho lamentavelmente para esses clubes esta grandeza do vit ria conquista se n o se compra por isso que h outros clubes que at gostariam de jogar no nosso est dio para terem um ambiente como o nosso mas n o t m porque a rela o dos adeptos com o clube n o se explica nem se exporta uma coisa que se sente que deve ter uma explica o sociol gica e que n o merece a pena ser copiada porque ser sempre uma tentativa falhada
5518170 o conhecimento que tenho do futebol portugu s e porque toda a gente me diz que esta poca o vit ria deve preparar se para ser o bombo da festa dos rbitros
5518171 recordo que na poca passada no campeonato come mos com tr s empates e todos diziam que n o ganh vamos a ningu m esta poca est a passar se o mesmo alguns maus resultados na pr epoca e um empate com o basileia e j suficiente para os doutores do futebol se intranquilizarem tenham calma que eu tamb m tenho a equipa boa melhor do que a do ano passado e tem um potencial tremendo
5518172 as pessoas dizem me que se n o passarmos a eliminat ria da champions league uma frustra o pois se acontecer que seja seria uma frustra o bonita em 86 anos de exist ncia nunca tiveram uma frustra o igual a esta o vit ria n o p ra a se for eliminado mas o vit ria n o vai ser eliminado
5518173 em primeiro lugar devo dizer que os adeptos do vit ria s o nicos s o uma coisa fant stica

5518187 the surge has succeeded and yet senator obama still cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5518188 nor has he been willing to heed the guidance of general petraeus or to listen to our troops on the ground when they say as they have said to me on my trips to iraq let us win just let us win instead senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight even in hindsight he would oppose the surge
5518189 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5518190 before al qaeda in iraq is defeated and before a competent trained and capable iraqi security force is in place and operating effectively
5518191 there will be no place among g 8 nations or in the wto for a modern russia that acts at times like the old soviet union the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5518192 i know how to catch bin laden i will follow him to the gates of hell
5518193 mccain s personal fortune traces back to organized crime in arizona
5518194 recently mccain responded to mitt romneys statement that he understood the economy based on his many years in the private sector by claiming romney had said a military career is not a real job
5518195 mccains neurotic boast that he is the only republican who supported the surge is beginning to sound as insane as bill clintons claim to being the first black president although less insulting to blacks
5518196 and yet for the 4 billionth time at the jan
5518197 a review of contemporaneous news stories about the surge clearly demonstrates that the only republicans who were so much as skeptical of the surge consisted of a few oddball liberal republicans such as sens gordon smith norm coleman and olympia snowe
5518198 they certainly werent attacking mccain their standard bearer in liberal republicanism but even if they were it was a low point for mccain being criticized by the likes of olympia snowe
5518199 like the democrats mccain thinks if he simply says something over and over again he can make people believe its true thus again at the south carolina debate on jan 10 mccain was proclaiming that he was the only one on this stage who supported the surge
5518200 mr straight talk announced one of the reasons why i won in new hampshire is because i went there and told them the truth that and the fact that democrats were allowed to vote in the republican primary
5518201 even in the florida primary allegedly limited to republicans mccain lost among republicans seventeen percent of the republican primary voters in florida called themselves independents
5518202 at least under president hillary republicans in congress would know that theyre supposed to fight back when president mccain proposes the same ideas tax hikes liberal judges and social security for illegals republicans in congress will support our president
5518203 it is incontrovertible multiple sources confirm that they remember it the same way and they are not john funds source as novak reports
5518204 mccain long after the fact repeated what the ted kennedy moveon people for the american way crowd said about alito
5518205 it makes no sense but he said it whether he remembers the specific comment or not he did say it so we need to try to understand it or at least get some pretty detailed commitments from senator mccain going forward i hope he and others will understand why this is necessary a president who confuses adherence to judicial restraint with conservative political decisions is very confused about how to select judges it is one thing to vote for and even praise judges some other chief executive has picked especially when it would be political suicide not to it is another to discern good supreme court appointments just ask ronald reagan or george bush pere or fils take your pick
5518206 senator john mccain as recently reported and discussed here and on the corner has said privately that he would not appoint jurists like justice samuel alito because he wears his conservatism on his sleeve
5518207 to refresh recollections many of justice alitos former law clerks fellow article iii judges and others a good number of whom were liberal democrats testified during his senate confirmation to the exact opposite proposition that justice alito did not wear any political ideology or convictions on his sleeve
5518208 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration
5518209 everyone in task force helmand is affected by the death of a soldier and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time
5518210 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5518211 while it is unclear exactly what caused their death an investigation is under way what is clear is that taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them
5518212 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5518213 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5518214 a number of individuals were detained and questioned as a result of a proactive operation
5518215 consequently some have been charged with drug related offences unconnected to the mullanys murder the two females arrested and charged last week are still in custody at her majestys prison
5518216 we are not in a position to disclose any details regarding their arrests and charges except to say they are linked to the other three persons presently in police custody
5518217 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5518218 we are not going to make any further comment at this time and we would ask that the media continues to respect our privacy
5518219 earlier today we informed the families of ben and catherine mullany of the latest developments in antigua the force is continuing its support of the ongoing investigation and trained family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
5518220 the whole country was in shock from this terrible crime
5518221 these charges will bring some degree of relief to the families of the victims the community and everyone who values life
5518222 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5518223 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar non believers with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5518224 the material in their possession promoted extreme ideology most notoriously of osama bin laden of al qaida as well as groups in various countries that adopted it
5518225 these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5518226 we hid in the bushes at the back of our house until 1pm
5518227 i condemn the dastardly attack and the violence sowed by the milf early this morning in some towns of lanao del norte
5518228 we will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5518229 illegal and they were ordered by rebel leaders to vacate the areas they attacked
5518230 but renegade or otherwise it amounts to an affront to our national government even the rebel leadership agrees with us that these renegade groups are breaking the law and we must make every effort to make sure that these things do not succeed
5518231 but if it continues this way i think we will have to seriously take a look at the whole situation are we talking to the correct people
5518232 creates pressure on hamas and is likely to accelerate the negotiations over gilad shalit
5518233 the gesture will not make hamas more flexible about its demands because the organization sees that israel is releasing prisoners with blood on their hands which merely causes hamas to harden its position
5518234 hamas is looking despairingly at how despite the fact that it holds shalit it is not succeeding in bringing about a prisoner release while abu mazen abbas who is conducting negotiations with israel is securing a prisoner release
5518235 its enough to see hamas response to the governments decision to understand the pressure the organization is under
5518236 a prisoner release is not interpreted as a gesture but as weakness
5518237 releasing prisoners as a gesture does not attest to weakness but to strength
5518238 prisoner exchange deals attest to weakness far more than does a move made in a manner and at a time convenient to us with the goal of strengthening moderate elements in the palestinian authority
5518239 the war between states it was a really neat fort in good condition well upkept and currently undergoing some minor maintenance
5518240 in my view that is not the best interest of the region especially for fiji and the solomon islands
5518241 the year on year increase in capacity follows the delivery of a number of new aircraft in recent months
5518242 also the deployment of the larger a380 in place of the b747 400s on the london sydney and tokyo routes also contributed to the capacity increase
5518243 east asia and west asia and africa route regions recorded declines due to new capacity introduced to these regions not yet being fully met by traffic growth

5518269 but the externals were not further involved instead as a result of the strange remarking exercise a number of students were moved from a straight fail to a borderline position permitting them to be deemed to have passed if marks for other subjects were high enough the net result was that students whom professor buckland and his co examiner had failed and whose failures had been endorsed first by the external examiner and then by the board of examiners were told that they had passed

5518272 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5518273 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5518274 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5518275 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5518276 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5518277 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5518278 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5518279 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5518280 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5518281 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter

5518287 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5518288 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

5518292 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5518293 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5518294 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5518295 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5518296 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5518297 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5518298 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5518299 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5518300 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

5518349 we want to see how frequent this occurs what steps might be taken do all judges approach this in the same way those kinds of things
5518350 obviously what needs to prevail here is the safety of the child
5518351 the only defence that child had was the law which is designed to defend her and the court who has an obligation to uphold that law
5518352 i suggest to you that the judge in this instance failed that child miserably but also failed in her duty as a judicial officer
5518353 i think somebody should be looking into what happened in this particular case
5518354 but whats more important is changing the rules going forward so you always have a criminal background check so that you always have proper representation for the child
5518355 i said to deputy mayor shelley carroll lets find a way to help the community and if there is something that we might be able to assist in we remain open to that
5518356 i didnt get into any specifics but i just said that if we can help you should call upon us and well take a look at it
5518357 just being there and seeing the windows blown out and the garage doors blown off and the roofs torn away just through the grace of god this happened at 4 oclock in the morning
5518358 this obviously raises some questions and we think we should take the time to get those answers
5518359 how hillary managed to have the guts to post on a gaming blog still amazes me
5518360 i just think that its a bad time to have him as the president we have this terrible president right now and the economy is in the shitter we need someone who is has some experience to run the country someone who wont get filibustered into eternity when dealing with congress im not gonna tell anyone who to vote for but the man is going to end up being jimmy carter part 2 if hes elected
5518361 what ea surely will do is consolidate its monopoly on sports games
5518362 by taking out all of that competition ea has a monopoly in sports if these guys have a monopoly theyre not going to cut pricing on sports games as quickly weve been seeing sports games come down in price before christmas the last couple of years thatll never happen again
5518363 you either played madden at eas price or you went home
5518364 yknow not hatin on sony but i would rather m with t2 than ea that would be death to sports games as we know it paying for sneaker downloads for nba how about paying for animations in madden or just mediocre sports games period
5518365 thats a good question i dont know of any specific games offhand i just used the rape pillage and plunder line
5518366 it seems to me like the best path would be to have m rated games treated as r rated movies

5518370 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5518371 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5518372 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5518373 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5518374 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5518375 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5518376 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5518377 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known

5518386 in the midst of filming it i discovered that it was hardcore but it was a little late to say well i dont do this sort of thing and then stomp off the set so i did it
5518387 and in that film i met marc stevens who was playing the high priest of sexual witchcraft to my high priestess and he was a hoot we just bonded right there on the set we had a great time

5518421 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5518422 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5518423 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5518437 a new england journal of medicine article three years ago said if you had heart disease and had a certain genetic makeup and you ate arachidonic acid the diameter of your coronary artery was smaller a major risk factor for a heart attack
5518438 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
5518439 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
5518440 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
5518441 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
5518442 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
5518443 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
5518444 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
5518445 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab

5518453 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5518454 fighting to become part of the system here in england the traditions and what not though as the show progresses he slowly starts to understand them and embraces them
5518455 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
5518456 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental
5518457 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5518458 i think going into season 4 this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship

5518484 im going to keep the same approach just make quality pitches
5518485 it may be a little different coming in in the middle of an inning but once youre out there and get the ball i think its the same thing
5518486 for me any time a manager or somebody shows they have confidence in you whether you have been struggling or not that means a lot

5518571 ia adalah hasil perjuangan umno dan bn jadi menidakkan perjuangan parti ini seolah olah kita tak buka peluang kepada bukan bumiputera
5518572 ini kerana sebahagian besar orang melayu dan islam sokong umno serta sebahagiannya sokong pas jadi untuk parti keadilan rakyat pkr dapat sokongan daripada orang cina dan india sebab itu dilontarkan cadangan buka uitm 10 peratus

5518596 jewish leader looks to obama rabbi hopes strong ties to black leaders will be rekindled
5518597 one thing that works in obamas favor is his mantra that the 60s are so yesterday hes not a descendent of slaves hes not trying to refight the cultural wars that gives him space to distance himself from the divisive politics of jesse jackson and louis farrakhan
5518598 jewish leader looks to obama rabbi hopes strong ties to black leaders will be rekindled
5518599 nothing could be better for the jewish community than to have both parties vying for the jewish vote
5518600 what makes america a great country in my view is that both parties have learned that its dangerous to write a group off we have very close elections and every vote counts

5518610 the republicans jumped on this i said absolutely immigrants need to learn english but we also need to learn foreign languages this is an example of some of the problems we get into when somebody attacks you for saying the truth which is we should want our children with more knowledge we should want our children to have more skills theres nothing wrong with that thats a good thing i know because i dont speak a foreign language its embarrassing
5518611 i agree that immigrants should learn english but instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english theyll learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual we should have every child speaking more than one language
5518612 i have a plan to grow this economy create more and better jobs and get america moving again i have a plan to reform government achieve energy security and ensure that healthcare and a quality education are affordable and available for all i believe the role of government is to unleash the creativity ingenuity and hard work of the american people and make it easier to create jobs at its core the economy isnt the sum of an array of bewildering statistics its about where americans work how they live how they pay their bills today and save for tomorrow its about small businesses opening their doors hiring employees and growing its about giving workers the education and training to find a good job and prosper in it its about the aspirations of the american people to build a better life for their families dreams that begin with a job americans are having a tough time but weve been through worse and beaten longer odds even in these difficult days we must believe in ourselves nothing is inevitable in america weve always been the captains of our fate all youve ever asked of government is that it stand on your side not in your way i intend to do just that to stand on your side to help business and not government create jobs to fight for your future and not the personal ambitions of politicians and bureaucrats

5518614 our officers are going to be on and around our campus more than a kirksville police department officer will be because thats our area thats our primary jurisdiction so thats where were going to be our concerns and our mission is to ensure safety of the campus and people who visit and use our facilities this will go a long way in helping us to be able to do that

5518637 and then a cat flew out of my butt for real
5518638 are any of these end of summer clearance tents canopies in the outdoor aisle of the discount store good for shows
5518639 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
5518640 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5518641 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5518642 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5518643 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5518644 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5518645 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5518646 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5518647 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5518648 hes a multi faceted complicated fellow hes a trained killer he speaks a variety of languages and he can repair his own chest wound from a gunshot
5518649 marshall is frequently a vital source of information for mary but sometimes he has the same flaws that spock displayed in that his emotional intelligence is sometimes insufficient for the situation
5518650 you need a passionate go getter like mary so in some ways it resembles the spock kirk dynamic if spock was in love with kirk
5518651 david maples has a sort of off center sensibility a really special voice
5518652 i felt like the part was written for a boy in that shes complex and edgy david had a fresh approach to writing a girl which i appreciated
5518653 were both a little bit grumpy acerbic and quick to judge those arent strengths but im comin clean she doesnt believe in anything mystical or magical and neither do i
5518654 theres a fine line between us and the characters at this point
5518655 marys a very funny acerbic person i try to give it back to her in a lighthearted way
5518656 we love each other and know how to push each others buttons and we enjoy doing it sort of like real life
5518657 being in the town where the show was actually set gives it an authenticity
5518658 apparently there are quite a few witnesses hiding there so i dont know if the show will help hide their cover
5518659 we had an incredible advisor who was the head of the witness program
5518660 he was on the set and we were able to pick his brain but it was difficult to research because of how secretive it is
5518661 our advisors job was to make sure we were on the right path but he couldnt say too much about it
5518662 the percentage of innocent people who go into it is much larger than i thought
5518663 i assumed it was basically mobsters but close to 40 are completely innocent people who need protection from organized criminals
5518664 theyve never lost a witness theyve never had anyone die
5518665 it brings some very real and new challenges i had to find a way of reinventing henry that made him seem older more cynical and controlled his temper gets much worse this season and he gets more vicious hes going down that long and dangerous road to loneliness and paranoia
5518666 its one of the great drama of all time the blood alone is amazing i think henry was responsible for the deaths of over 70 000 people imagine he went from this golden figure which he was as a young man to an utterly decadent and corrupted human being
5518667 early on theres an amazing scene with tigh in the cic youll certainly know it when you see it
5518668 they jumped on it really fast sometimes conditions just combine to make it difficult to catch
5518669 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5518670 wow i wish i could watch the except with lower production values
5518671 when it comes to my tivoed choices my husband usually shakes his head in disgust in fact he once told me that i epitomized everything wrong with the viewing public
5518672 i wish i could say i was a connoisseur of television like my hubby but usually the house red is as good as the expensive wines for me
5518673 the reason for his disgust my love for reality programming i cant help it i enjoy reality shows they are my guilty pleasure i love the drama the fights the relationships and yes the concept of finding love in front of millions
5518674 so when the opportunity to watch a new dating show before it came out to the public arose i was ecstatic a farmer and city girls sounds ingenious what kind of delicious predictments will they be getting into
5518675 from a girl who watches just about everything i have to say sadly and for the first time i didnt buy it
5518676 the common denominator in all my other dating shows is that desire to be with the main guy i really like the british guy on the current
5518677 but to date or marry a farmer you can well you can live on a farm and milk cows
5518678 i realize that all the girls on every dating show are shallow and probably want to just get on tv but somehow i usually forget that and believe that they want to fall in love
5518679 another problem is that a lot of this show feels contrived yes i know all of them are contrived but at least the other ones fake it better
5518680 like i said ill invest myself in just about anything no matter how terrible i mean i married jay right
5518681 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring

5518689 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
5518690 it became much more important to make all these choices as a witting conscious consumer of life
5518691 and deeper than that there was a sense that if you did follow a traditional route
5518692 now it means choosing your breast size it might mean choosing the way your nose looks almost every discrete element of our lives now can be looked at as a consumer choice

5518727 as a result of labors proposed reform we will actually see up to a million people moving from the private system back onto our already under resourced public hospital queues
5518728 that is going to compound problems and make them worse
5518729 we certainly wont be doing anything to jeopardise the governments financial position
5518730 quite clearly there is not a confidence out there in the community that the environmental protection and planning for the greater darwin area is occurring and that i think is the reality of the situation no matter what governments of any colour is saying and we need that information

5518801 my view is that 2012 is useful as a meme if it helps us to catalyze a shift in global culture and consciousness rather than fretting about what may or may not happen on that date we should concentrate on the work that needs to be done now on an inner as well as outer level
5518802 surge toward the zero state each time a cycle enters its terminal phase
5518803 one of my guesses is what we will discover in 2012 is time travel if technologies were developed in 2012 that were able to move through time it would explain why the wave could no longer give a linear description of the unfolding of events because the unfolding of events would go non linear

5518870 este vorba de o situatie de incadrare a unei persoane in grad de handicap pe legislatia actuala acum un an de zile o persoana a fost incadrata in grad de handicap handicap cu grad grav fara ca macar sa cunoasca acest lucru
5518871 comisia trebuie sa analizeze acte medicale emise de medici specialisti din spitale au fost aduse aceste acte medicale nu stim cum au fost ele obtinute
5518872 s a facut o ancheta sociala se pare ca in acel moment persoana in cauza era sub efectul unor sedative statea la pat urmare si a acestei anchete a fost incadrata in grad de handicap
5518873 persoana incadrata in acest grad de handicap a aflat abia dupa un an de zile ca beneficiaza de aceste drepturi care sigur nu le vedea pentru ca nu ajungea la domnia sa noi am dispus o reexpertizare si s a constat ca nu este vorba de handicap si este vorba de o boala de batrinete persoana depasind 70 ani

5518875 am stat cinci luni pe orizontala iar apoi m am deplasat cu ajutorul unui scaun cu rotile in fiecare zi 7 zile din 7 am facut kinetoterapie si am fost ajutat de un logoped
5518876 imi placea sa muncesc asa ca am renuntat la pensie si am lucrat initial patru ore pe zi iar apoi opt ore
5518877 nu puteam fi de acord cu suma avansata de debitoare deoarece as fi primit banii in mai bine de sapte ani
5518878 ea stia ca a fost condamnata printr o sentinta definitiva si irevocabila iar daca mai avea si alte cheltuieli nu ma intereseaza din acel accident am avut si inca am probleme de sanatate conform certificatului de handicap depus la dosar
5518879 am semnat in fata executorului judecatoresc ca sint de acord cu plata a 1 500 de lei lunar nu am putut sa depun nici un ban in acel cont motivat de faptul ca executarea a fost suspendata pina la obtinerea unei hotariri judecatoresti din aceasta cauza nu mi am putut indeplini obligatia asumata si nu pentru ca as fi de rea credinta
5518880 aceasta doamna nu face altceva decit sa tergiverseze prin orice mijloace acordarea daunelor pe care le a dat instanta clientului meu ea are veniturile necesare si cu toate acestea nu face altceva decit sa amine prin orice mijloace executarea hotaririi

5518890 se poate pune intrebarea ce ar fi urmat sa faca morar la bruxelles
5518891 este surprinzator ca dupa toti acesti ani indelungati de negocieri de aderare si acum de stat membru bucurestiul tot nu intelege ca nu de relatii publice are nevoie comisia europeana ci de rezultate iar asta mai mult ca oricind
5518892 e un fel de deja vu intreaga idee seamana foarte mult cu ultimele luni ale guvernului nastase cind nastase geoana diaconescu si puscas aproape ca se stabilisera in fata institutiilor europene venind cel putin de trei ori pe luna la bruxelles pentru a face lobby astfel incit ue sa inchida capitolul 24 justitie si afaceri interne n r acordind prioritate asa cum au facut o dintotdeauna relatiilor publice nu rezultatelor

5518894 after this passes we will be out on the road with the fleet for little fleet aka the big bus ministering to and helping women and families across the state of south dakota
5518895 i felt terrible for the women families and children of south dakota who still had to deal with the scourge of abortion i especially grieved for the post abortive women who gave their heart and soul working on the campaign
5518896 its a fight on a high level im in my element the sword is out i need to go into battle im more than motivated im all fired up
5518897 finally its time im impatient i want to find players to relaunch the machine
5518898 its a new departure with a rejuvenated squad and our objective is clear south africa and the world cup
5518899 its flattering of course to be compared to zidane but its a little bit annoying as well
5518900 its a lot of pressure on my shoulders and really hard to be compared to probably the best footballer of the last 10 years when you are a young player you dont tend to play well every week so it is a lot of pressure
5518901 bring the players together even for a short time to discover where we at without there being anything really at stake points wise it will allow us to sort things out

5518908 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5518909 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5518910 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
5518911 din 2009 vor exista comenzi de stat cu finantare consecventa

5518914 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5518915 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5518916 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
5518917 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5518918 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5518919 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5518920 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5518921 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5518922 why shouldnt the innocence thats presumed by criminal law be considered actual innocence isnt that a distinction without a difference
5518923 certainly with an event of this sort of scale and duration wed expect some erosion to be happening and in the waipa system as well
5518924 the high water table is causing water to run over farmland where it doesnt normally run over farmland
5518925 im keeping a constant eye on it its not improving at this stage
5518926 there are one or two areas that are so saturated we are ending up with having problems near arapuni and near whakamaru
5518927 are you sure this is the right place i thought this was supposed to be all forest
5518928 but i think they bulldozed this entire forest to the ground and then built these pits and funnels
5518929 really what gave that away einstein was it the fact that the forest is completely gone or the vehicle tracks all over the place
5518930 looks like theres some sort of dust storm in the city
5518931 oh crap this is not good come on grab your bag we have to move
5518932 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5518933 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
5518934 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
5518935 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions
5518936 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5518937 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5518938 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5518939 calculamos que el monto que est n pidiendo est muy por encima de su valor real

5518941 chris killen this is dodgy why dont you get a car or something man

5518943 um oh dear i believe i have to uh come here you time to get uh stabbed
5518944 no this is my imaginary sister get a hold of yourself man for gods sake
5518945 he understands this piece and who to show it to because it is a distinct feeling
5518946 it looks like there is glue on it or something
5518947 think before you decide whether or not youd like to publish with me check around find out about me
5518948 the other one was better it smelled like cantaloupe rotting in the garbage this new edit smells like a cantaloupe air freshener in the garbage
5518949 oh man whens he going to post again what a cockmunch
5518950 oh nice work i had totally forgotten about your blog
5518951 listen man i understand your situation but it is not going to change i will fuck you up if you touch me
5518952 this is good i used to watch wrestling a lot and i like people with a sense of humor
5518953 say hi to everyone and tell daryl the blacksmith i wish he would update the i like it blog
5518954 this all could have been avoided but you had to correct me
5518955 babe you look fine now come to bed so i can put my penis into your butthole
5518956 this is how you make me feel when you say things i dont want to hear or have already said and now that i think about it most things that are said i dont want to hear but im not that big of an asshole where id say please dont say anything because it means nothing to me i think everyone should say whatever and the air will get heavy like a garbage bag full of rocks and the edges will expand and its too bad i started thinking while i was typing this because now i have no clue whats going on
5518957 hey brandon scott gorrell have you ever heard of the electric nighthawks theyre this band and they rock and stuff and they make me want to extend my forefinger and my pinky finger and worship the devil have you ever listened to the band i just named
5518958 i have no food at my place and the water in my sink smells like an old ladys breath

5518963 hopefully the situation will improve and result in a reduction of troops
5518964 the meeting will prove successful in resolving the problem step by step
5518965 i think at the meeting today yesterday and tomorrow we will achieve a total withdrawal of troops at and around the pagoda so the problem will be settled
5518966 everything is fine both sides understand each other and there will be no confrontation
5518967 on august 5 us newspapers carried the story of the capture of dr
5518968 ridley has been running a campaign called cage prisoner for the release of a mysterious female prisoner who has been held at the bagram airbase in afghanistan in total isolation and regularly tortured for five years
5518969 quinn and hibernian have said that they have built the cost of risk equalisation payments into their premiums
5518970 does this mean that they will now reduce their premiums
5518971 no payments have been made under the risk equalisation scheme
5518972 the absence of the scheme means that vhi customers alone have financed community rating where everyone pays the same for similar insurance cover regardless of their age to date the decision may have serious consequences for older and chronically ill members
5518973 will now have to have a serious look at the price increase planned before the supreme court decision
5518974 its possible that quinn and hibernian will not have a price increase over the next year because of this decision prices should go down for those customers who are with quinn and vivas and prices will more likely go up for those with vhi
5518975 i would like to especially reassure all elderly members of the community that they will continue to have access to all of our plans at the same price
5518976 the fact its now gone means ireland can develop its health insurance market more the shadow of risk equalisation has prevented a proper health insurance market from developing it has sapped the energy out of people who could have helped boost the health system it has deterred companies from coming here to develop insurance products for long term medical care we need a good public health system and a competitive health insurance market
5518977 we would have an interest in the private health insurance market in ireland if we could get the right scale
5518978 there is no point talking about protecting the elderly and the vulnerable if you have a two tier health system
5518979 the only system that will work is a one tier health system mandatory universal health insurance would be sustainable it would ensure everyone would have equal access to healthcare
5518980 ireland already funds health service provision for all residents equally through compulsory taxation
5518981 to introduce a further compulsory source of funding for universal insurance would effectively be a substantial increase in taxation there would be great complexities in any move from a taxation funded health service to a compulsory insurance funded health service

5518995 we didnt make any plays i probably held the ball too long and made a lot of mental errors
5518996 the productivity wasnt there for the offense so you can never sit and say the quarterback played well when that doesnt happen
5518997 there are some decisions im sure well look at and well learn from based on once again the whole offense it was not a good evening for any of our quarterbacks
5518998 by no means do we think this was going to be easy for any of the quarterbacks theyre young experience is not on their side they need to play games
5518999 hes a guy we feel like understands the position well
5519000 hes got good ball skills so were bringing him in not just for a camp body im anxious to see him play and see what hes got and to see if theres a fit for us

5519007 i tend to get bored when people start saying wheres the record already hey im not fucking off in there it just takes a long time nirvana may be able to make a record in two weeks thats great were not doing that to me every song means reinventing the whole process there are no constants except maybe that ill sing it but are the rhythm tracks going to be played or sequenced are they going to be real fake machines drums sounds car doors slamming its not a simple matter of yelling out chords to someone across the room and starting the tape machine its a different situation im not saying that makes my record any better than theirs its just a different set of parameters
5519008 we have not cashed any checks or run any credit cards if our 90 000 goal is not met by this friday all donors will be contacted and given the choice to receive their money back or have us keep it as a tax deductible donation
5519009 the democrats neglecting to choose obama are disproportionately white female and middle aged an inclination that it could be former supporters of hillary clinton that are holding out
5519010 you can actually quite quickly get your values over a time period
5519011 most flood events we get more water through the waipa than the waikato because with the karapiro dam we can actually manipulate the flows we can avoid that peak river confluence coincidence at ngaruawahia
5519012 if we had the two rivers in flood together then it puts a lot of pressure on downstream areas we try and balance it weve got to be conscious of balancing that risk across the whole 400 km of the river
5519013 there is no way development could have occurred without these stopbanks
5519014 but in the overall scheme of things its the best outcome
5519015 the technology is just great i just dont know how they did it 20 years ago
5519016 many people initially use methamphetamine recreationally at a party or in a social setting but one of the properties of the drug is it promotes wakefulness
5519017 long haul drivers in the us and australia have a reputation for using the drug to keep themselves awake in my experience weve seen students use it to keep themselves awake during study as well as shift workers and people with heavy work demands but it can become a chicken and egg situation people may use it recreationally but then find they have to work longer hours to support their use

5519023 i just never believed wed be the ones here with the gold medal
5519024 i pushed myself to the limit and beyond but for peace of mind i know there was nothing more i could have done
5519025 its a fine line not getting sidetracked by having the world championships here in 2010 itll be a balancing act
5519026 theres good talent at the under 23 level that we want to shape towards london 2012
5519027 everyone goes away for a few months gets their heads together and tries to have a semi normal life and regroup and then decide after that
5519028 the guy that got the silver medal today was juri jaanson estonia and he is 42 he is nine years older than me and as long as im still worthwhile out there be it rowing or sailing there is certainly a desire to keep doing sport while i can
5519029 made our life a little harder as expectations are up over what we can do

5519036 hispanics dont only mark the fastest growing segment of the population but also one of our fastest rising readership segments
5519037 in some vague hope that those who write nonsense will start to think more clearly
5519038 because everybody knows what it means american style comic books they know what it looks like and can point to industry sales statistics comic books are clearly objects that exist in time and space since the things that happen in comic books follow a set of rules and involve activities that dont happen elsewhere one can use the term to indicate a genre of popular fiction comic books can be formatted in different ways thus a 200 page comic book is still a comic book

5519056 purchasing carbon offsets is a way for consumers to make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions both locally and globally

5519068 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
5519069 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
5519070 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
5519071 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
5519072 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
5519073 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
5519074 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
5519075 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
5519076 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
5519077 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
5519078 new book out and making the move to open access
5519079 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
5519080 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
5519081 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5519082 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5519083 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5519084 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
5519085 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
5519086 however a number of prison officers have been working too much overtime and this has become an occupational health and safety issue
5519087 the department believes it is important that there is a balance between work and time away from the demands of the job and we want officers to have more quality time at home
5519088 of course prison officers will continue to earn overtime that is part of the 24 hour job of supervising and managing the states 32 correctional centres but excessive overtime will be stamped out
5519089 editing audio is just like writing code you have to know what not to keep
5519090 if your erection lasts for more than four hours consult your doctor
5519091 overall sen obamas middle class tax cuts are larger than his partial rollbacks for families earning over 250 000 making the proposal as a whole a net tax cut and reducing revenues to less than 18 2 of gdp the level of taxes that prevailed under president reagan
5519092 yeah right just run down to washington and talk to them
5519093 i know im a doctor and on several of their boards and i need to talk to congressmen
5519094 none of these defenses have been litigated before so it would have taken a lot of work and a lot of time
5519095 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5519096 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5519097 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our from their country
5519098 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5519099 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5519100 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5519101 however with the unfortunate passing of both of her parents i believe betty represents s best option to keep the states election division moving in a positive direction

5519105 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5519106 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5519107 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5519108 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned

5519112 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5519129 no there are other hobbies that cost a bit more like my model airplanes i like or flying lessons
5519130 do you mind my wanting to stop at knit shops wherever we go
5519131 no not really i dont mind it that bad its just when youre in there for two and a half hours when you said that youd only be a few minutes that makes me dislike it
5519132 do you think the house would be cleaner if i didnt knit
5519133 no you have four kids well maybe but not that much youre pretty anal
5519134 they can if they want but its a little weird
5519135 how much money do you think i spend on yarn and knitting
5519136 500 plus and then some or maybe a 1 000
5519137 do you think that dad realizes how much i spend
5519138 yeah he lets you spend that much because he loves you
5519139 do you remember that for the longest time you were adamant that when you grew up you were going to work in a yarn store winding yarn
5519140 how long do you think i could go without knitting
5519141 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5519142 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5519143 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5519144 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5519145 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5519146 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5519147 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5519148 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5519149 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama

5519219 dont take a picture of me i dont have make up on
5519220 youre not feeling it necessary to reach our destination excessively quickly are you
5519221 well thats pleasing to know and so it would not perturb you if we proceeded at a leisurely pace
5519222 and the exertion isnt belaboring your person in an unpleasant fashion
5519223 my first glimpse of you proclaimed your steadfastness i could tell you were in a word a trooper so would you have the stamina to converse somewhat as we continue we can commence slowly and youll be sure to cease any vocal exertion should your respiration not be sufficient to your physical requirements
5519224 i heartily enjoy a good conversation and as long as i maintain a suitable concentration on the task at hand therell be no difficulty at all not in the least
5519225 my original intention was to let you begin with some description of yourself and whatever it might interest you to converse about until i get my equilibrium in hand er reach my stride dont you know then we could do a little more of the back and forth sort of thing
5519226 my name is lauren as you alraeady know but you havent told me yet how you happened to know it i suppose you might have guessed it still to guess someones name on the first try when youve only just met seems a bit suspicious to me but you can explain that to me when we get into our back and forth conversation
5519227 im ten years old and i live on the top of a big hill with my mother and father and theres no one else for miles and miles around so i dont go to school bt my father teaches me reading and writing and art and music and my mother teaches me arithmetic and geography and history and science and they both say that im very bright for my age and i think i might be because nothing i study seems very difficult but that might be because my parents each test me on what the other one teaches me and maybe they make it too easy cause they want me to get it right and i guess all parents want to think theyre children are very smart so sometimes i just dont know if i am or not

5519270 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5519271 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all

5519306 the water sharing agreement is a major health and safety victory for the city of new berlin
5519307 after being ordered by the state department of natural resources to resolve the threat posed by radium contaminated wells in the central third of new berlin or face substantial fines our engineers researched a number of alternatives repairing the system would cost many millions of dollars and purchasing water from racine or oak creek would not be cost effective at this time the agreement with the city of milwaukee is the best combination of cost and providing new berlin citizens with the safest healthiest water available
5519308 our joint and successful efforts such as passage of the great lakes compact and the water talks between our two cities show the good that can come from suburban and urban leaders finding ways to work cooperatively
5519309 the city of new berlin looks forward to finalizing these agreements with the city of milwaukee and to future positive partnerships

5519315 a further 44 walking wounded patients have been taken to the medical centre at alton towers and are being treated by medical staff and doctors
5519316 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
5519317 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5519318 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5519319 of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one has been airlifted to university hospital north staffordshire
5519320 twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital

5519324 it is believed that the coach was from the peterborough area
5519325 i heard this massive crash and rumble crunching metal it sounded initially like a thunderstorm but then we heard shouts and screams
5519326 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned and it looked like it had ploughed into a car and down into a garden
5519327 there were many walking wounded being seen to by ambulance staff and half a dozen with head wounds
5519328 with the theme park kicking out there was a lot of traffic on the roads and they were all being diverted
5519329 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway
5519330 one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5519331 it must have dropped about 20ft it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5519332 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority of the people were walking wounded
5519333 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5519334 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them

5519337 actually our colleagues are in rougher shape than we are

5519342 one of the goals of nrp was to reinvent the way the city delivered services that is yet to be realized working directly with the city we can fulfill that vision
5519343 this department will help the city be more responsive to neighborhoods
5519344 so far as i know the program is the most ambitious of its kind in any large or medium sized american city o nly in minneapolis do those citizens receive such substantial funds to translate their discussions and plans into realities
5519345 in an age when so many people have become disillusioned with government your program clearly demonstrates that empowering people into meaningful opportunities in their own neighborhoods can have a tremendously transformative effect
5519346 support neighborhood organizations strengthen resident involvement in neighborhood and community organizations and coordinate activities between the city and neighborhood and community organizations
5519347 we needed to find a way to sustain it in the long term with a more direct relationship with the city we need to break down the barriers
5519348 it focuses attention of city hall policymakers and staff making sure our relationship with neighbors is close productive and positive the new department will have nrp as one of the programs inside the department but it wont be the only function it will serve as a place where neighbors can interact with the city on a number of issues
5519349 the thing that distinguishes nrp is the level of control
5519350 were talking about real empowerment residents are treated more as equals in the discussion
5519351 the danger of it being a city program is that now the direction is that you get support if you play along but what happens if a neighbor doesnt like the way the city wants to deal with it theres always going to be fear that the funding will be cut off if they become too outspoken
5519352 nobody has explained exactly what the city plan is improving
5519353 it makes neighborhoods subject to the whims of the city council which is a recipe for disaster
5519354 has a fixed amount of money for a longer period
5519355 theres a lot of support to keep the structure like this
5519356 everything is a guesstimate its a grand experiment with nothing behind it
5519357 yeah i think theyre back to 13 im sure they will go to africa at least i hope they do
5519358 no intersections why should a lead team have to wait for another team and then also work with them travel west not east it is easier on the bodys time clock time check out so you do not have all of the teams get to the same place at the same time waiting for something to open totally unfair double road blocks one team member does one task the other team member does another task with a bunch teams at the start have real detours start in la but have half of the teams go to hawaii and half to alaska
5519359 hmm i just realised that they got a good lead and then they said bye bye

5519380 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5519381 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5519382 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our from their country
5519383 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5519384 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned

5519474 certainly the continued growth of cdhps is a key headline to come out of this years survey
5519475 fee for service and exclusive provider organizations now virtually disappeared from the market and hmos are losing ground as employers seek to help contain the rising cost of health care and insurance premiums
5519476 across the board were seeing a trend toward employee empowerment and participation when it comes to health care
5519477 theyre taking more control over health care expenditures by increasing participation in cdhps and they are also realizing that there are financial benefits in addition to health benefits of participating in wellness programs as the 2008 presidential election approaches and health care costs and plans continue to be a focus of national attention we only anticipate that employees will look even harder at their own health plans designs and costs
5519478 the intent of the survey is to provide employers of all sizes with the data they need to manage their health care benefit programs effectively
5519479 especially for employers with fewer than 1 000 employees and employers who have operations in multiple locations this survey is the only source of reliable regional and in many cases state health plan benchmarks by employer size and industry categories

5519508 friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5519509 there is something special about jesse hes very very determined
5519510 hes got a huge engine and i can see him making a name for himself in the individual pursuit or in a professional cycling team
5519511 i was riding 3 57 at 27 years of age these guys are riding it at 25 or younger its special i tell you and new zealand cycling is lucky to have such high quality youngsters coming through
5519512 i recall his first national title when we trained for the under 15 nationals in invercargill and trained for the road race
5519513 we went down to the event and he ended up winning the time trial and has just developed from there
5519514 not sufficient to eliminate the need to furlough between 140 and 180 pilots
5519515 would we have liked to save every pilots job yes
5519516 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5519517 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5519518 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5519519 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5519520 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5519521 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5519522 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5519523 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5519524 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5519525 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5519526 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said
5519527 this group thought they could use counter surveillance to go below the police radar
5519528 theyd learned the lessons about us infiltrating paedophile rings that were openly sharing with each other and created this site which in essence appeared to be legal
5519529 in every one of the pictures thats been recovered the image is of a real child a real human being who has been brutally abused
5519530 we have harvested those images and we are now committed to identifying the children that we can searching them out and rescuing them in the real world
5519531 this operation highlights the importance of law enforcement agency relationships both internationally with ceop in the uk and through the virtual global taskforce partners and locally with our state and territory police
5519532 this is not just another successful result in this crime type but it underlines the constant problem police worldwide face in the downloading of child abuse images
5519533 we will continue to relentlessly pursue those individuals who choose to trade access download and publish online child abuse images and child exploitation material
5519534 and if you are one of those people know that police could be knocking on your door tomorrow
5519535 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5519536 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5519537 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5519538 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned

5519551 i need to find out who is lobbying to keep the penny
5519552 warrens different from dobson in that youre not going to hear him saying all this bitter nasty stuff about secularists or the pro choice movement
5519553 warren is now putting forward a new image and a new style but not new ideas or really new politics
5519554 hes doing it at a time when it makes a lot of sense for an ambitious preacher with aspirations to power to stop putting all his eggs in the republican basket
5519555 warren is a pioneer of seeker sensitive evangelicalism aka consumer tested christianity saddleback is designed to seem like what its attendees want it to be
5519556 its more mild mannered than the mean old fundamentalism of the late jerry falwell more life style oriented a theology specially made for its orange county congregation every bit as conservative as old jerrys faith but much more suburban much more middle class
5519557 t he hard core religious right the dobsonites hagee and parsley and robertsons folks are somewhere between 8 10 of the electorate nobody expects them to ever do anything other than vote for republicans theres another group perhaps another 10 15 of the electorate who are more of a swing vote even if they do share some or all of the political stances of the religious right
5519558 like billy graham warren knows that liberals mistake his kind spiritedness for moderation
5519559 in fact warren stands side by side with the hardest right wing of fundamentalism theological point by point but hes a much better salesman

5519566 each dish transported us straight back to italy with the sweet and sour onions served with artisan salami from fra mani we were suddenly eating dinner at a rustic agriturismo outside bologna

5519571 quando il sistema educativo fallisce nellidentificare i soggetti con dislessia in giovane et molti anche se in possesso di un alto potenziale imprenditoriale non avranno lopportunit di esprimere il proprio talento nascosto il sistema scolastico dovrebbe essere in grado di valorizzare molto di pi i ragazzi dislessici anzich emarginarli
5519572 mi ripetevano tutto il tempo quanto ero lento e stupido ogni giorno di scuola era una fonte di stress e delusione
5519573 questi studenti hanno bisogno di un ambiente educativo pi pragmatico ed olistico che permetta loro di esprimere appieno il proprio potenziale un approccio simile produrrebbe una societ pi ricca di imprenditori
5519574 gli imprenditori dislessici sono maestri nel comunicare con il loro team i clienti i media il loro stile semplice e immediato arriva dritto al cuore eccellono inoltre nel problem solving nel gestire pi business e pi persone allo stesso tempo nella media 25 persone contro le 17 dei non dislessici e nel delegare abitudine che devono apprendere per farsi aiutare
5519575 se i sistemi scolastici modificassero lapproccio educativo nei confronti dei ragazzi affetti da dislessia conclude avremmo sicuramente pi casi di imprenditori di successo
5519576 our experience is that sharing waters are more commonly a point of cooperation rather than conflict and we will continue to work in this area given the increasing demand for water
5519577 this essential treaty has been stalled for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5519578 most of the worlds trans boundary river basins lack adequate legal protection and the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5519579 take ethiopia and egypt which have negotiated trade agreements following the nile basin initiative
5519580 now some of the poorest countries in africa which border the river nile cooperate on managing the water resources in turn contributing to peace and stability economic growth and tackling climate change this is a result of recognising a common not conflicting resource
5519581 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are

5519606 because youre going to show your hand as far as what you do on the goal line thats the thing about the preseason you dont want to show too much
5519607 it was good to come out two weeks in a row and get a sustained drive and some third down conversions
5519608 but we want touchdowns we dont want field goals then weve got to eliminate the three and outs we cant go long drive then two three and outs and then go another 10 play drive we just have to have sustained drives if we can go back out there and get four five or six play drives it at least gives our defense a little rest

5519938 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5519939 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5519940 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5519941 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5519942 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5519943 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5519944 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5519945 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5519946 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5519947 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5519948 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5519949 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5519950 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5519951 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5519952 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5519953 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5519954 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5519955 we might roll down the shutters we got built in generators
5519956 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5519957 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5519958 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5519959 everybody seems to be acting like this is a non event
5519960 i am a professional agent and i would like to meet with you to discuss listing your house
5519961 frankly i am puzzled i have noticed your house did not sell we have sold many houses in your area would you mind meeting up to see why your house did not sell we have few buyers interested in your area and we could get it sold
5519962 my 14 year old son could buy a block of detroit property
5519963 this is a huge thing thats why i was kind of nervous
5519964 he would tell me dont tell me what im doing well
5519965 i know that tell me what i need to do to become a good player he said if we do this switch i dont want to be just good at it i want to be really good at it
5519966 i said craig if you want to do that then you have to think about gold gloves and he won four of them
5519967 its offense baserunning everything you see now from second basemen it started with craig he was truly one of the greatest players who ever played this game
5519968 i cant tell you how privileged i am to have had the chance to play with him for the last 15 years youre an amazing player an amazing father an amazing husband anyone with a child sitting next to them you want your child to grow up and be craig biggio
5519969 even if it was by accident like when he accidentally moved his arm out and accidentally got hit by the pitch
5519970 he would chew a piece of gum and when it was time for him to bat he would stick the piece of gum in his helmet and save it for later
5519971 that nasty helmet you saw on the outside had gum stains all on the inside
5519972 bagwell volunteered to come over and drive it and help get the diamond in good shape
5519973 terry deserves it hes been a great brother to me he works hard hes a good man
5519974 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5519975 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5519976 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5519977 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5519978 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5519979 o sta cosa lha trovata stefano andate a visitare lui invece che rimanere da noi che siamo solo na manica cialtroni con i calli al sedere
5519980 goh die heeft dezelfde toon als ik op de telefoon
5519981 the name waikoko springs is the only remnant of traditional practices that once existed
5519982 the significance of the updated wahi tapu therefore relates to the presence of the original source of the water rather than the extraordinary formation of a manmade lake
5519983 weve told them we are not interested in being part of any process
5519984 we have made no formal approach to the council and as far as im concerned they have no claim on anything around here
5519985 we ought not to interfere with the decision that the plan is fair and reasonable in all the circumstance
5519986 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaida and extremist groups
5519987 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges that they face
5519988 the decision by president musharraf will now open up the possibility for the new government to act more decisively on issues facing it and i think that will allow the united states to work in closer cooperation in the weeks ahead
5519989 the fight against these kinds of groups that are interested in attacking the united states or our allies or friends around the world is a fight that was much larger than musharraf as an individual and required institutional changes within the pakistani army intelligence and also at the civilian level among the civilian political leaders to address the rising tide of extremism throughout the country
5519990 with musharraf out of the way it actually provides an opportunity now for the united states to distance itself to some extent so that if the military and the civilian government can agree on a policy which i think inevitably is going to have to be a more aggressive approach to the extremists it will not be seen as american policy
5519991 were proud to be the first manufacturer to offer a clean diesel vehicle for sale in all fifty states
5519992 we believe our jetta tdis truly offer a no compromise alternative fuel driving experience that provides the customer the best of both worlds excellent fuel efficiency combined with a dynamic driving experience
