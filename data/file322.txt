3220000 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3220001 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3220002 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3220003 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3220004 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3220005 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3220006 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3220007 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3220008 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3220009 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3220010 this shows that inflation is a bit higher than expected andraises fears about possible pressure on company earnings
3220011 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3220012 we are trying to stop this as soon as possible
3220013 their purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of georgia
3220014 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
3220015 as i write russia is waging war on my country
3220016 it wasnt the lowest of times i was somewhere below that
3220017 more than 30 years later this was what my life had become
3220018 somewhere beyond treading water just holding on without really caring
3220019 but i had to say to myself its okay being fit and being in better shape than most 42 year olds
3220020 it was to the point where we didnt know what was going to happen to her
3220021 here there is someone i trust who i know who ive selected and who is committed that gives us hope that laylas future can be good

3220023 many people dont think of balance when they think of personal training they think of diet and weight loss or they want to get ready for a wedding or reunion
3220024 since you are trying to stabilize your body youre using multiple muscle groups and can burn so many more calories
3220025 all you need to do is stand on one leg in various poses and you can do that anywhere

3220036 o n friday we do a media interviews sic and basically say that he is unvetted discuss his ever changing positions release the tapes create immediate pressure that deprives him of oxygen
3220037 these were various tapes we acquired from previous campaigns that showed obama had flipped positions penn was obsessed with these this actually pretty much played out one of the tapes aired on abc news and others were published in the washington times
3220038 one thing that i thought was most positive was that we were very physical
3220039 i thought in the first half we went toe to toe with those guys
3220040 we are going to kill ourselves when we get in first and 15 or third and long situations
3220041 the other thing we are going to work on is we had three turnovers on the plus side of the 50 and we only came away with 10 points a field goal and touchdown that is when you have the advantage and you could convert those situations into points
3220042 the way they disguise plays in the nfl with the motions and everything you still match up and play football

3220052 would it be possible for him to withdraw all his combat troops in 16 months
3220053 would it be a good idea to remove all combat troops in 16 months
3220054 physically it would be extremely difficult it would take a complete activation of americas reserve air corps and the entire navy to bring all equipment home in that time frame unless of course you leave all the equipment behind and nobody thinks that would be a good idea so no it would not be physically possible
3220055 absolutely not doing so would leave gaping holes in security and without the proper strategy leaving in 16 months would be a very dangerous proposition and could put troops in harms way
3220056 no more bullets fired no more u s led security checkpoints etc in iraq after 16 months

3220120 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3220121 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3220122 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3220123 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3220124 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3220125 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3220126 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3220127 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3220135 he was always a bit of a rebel i guess you could say in terms of bucking authority sometimes but i think he felt the army was the authority he did like
3220136 i would say it sometimes takes a bit of a crazy person to join the army or to want to be in the army
3220137 he was always willing to try something at least once whether it was a good thing or a bad thing
3220138 hed been in contact before with the enemy so he knows what to expect
3220139 he knows how to get through it and that sort of experience is very valuable for young ncos
3220140 unfortunately he seemed to scare more kids than he cheered up but hes a great guy hes got a real sense of humour
3220141 remembered with the utmost gratitude and respect of this nation

3220166 the generation of the 1940s were a generation which endured hunger strike the blanket in portlaoise the internment camp the gallows and the firing squad their sacrifice ensured the survival of the irish republican ideal
3220167 richard goss epitomised that generation the poet austin clarke in his poem the last republicans dedicated to the irish republicans of 1936 46 wrote that the generation of 1913 23 had inspired the succeeding generation
3220168 richard like his father was also an active trade unionist working in rawsons shoe factory he was an officer in the local branch of the national union of shoe and boot operatives
3220169 along with local republicans such as paddy murphy he trained in the cooley mountains
3220170 going on the run richard goss was appointed oc north leinster south ulster division of the ira in preparation for a campaign against british forces in the six counties
3220171 the executions of the 1940s the deaths on hunger strike all took place under the dark cloud of censorship
3220172 the funeral of richard goss is recorded in the pages of the united irishman by se mus g okelly
3220173 it was a military funeral in every sense of the word his coffin was lowered into the grave and after the clay had been filled in and the last post sounded there came the crack of the three volleys which told the assembled multitudes that another fenian grave had been made
3220174 we honour also today the memory of willie gaughran friend and comrade of richard goss captured on the english campaign in early 1939 he was sentenced to 10 years and sent to camphill prison isle of wight there he contracted tb and was released in 1946 he died some months later
3220175 today the cause which inspired richard goss to dedicate and ultimately sacrifice his life a free and independent ireland remains unfulfilled
3220176 meanwhile we hear calls for unity from many disparate elements irish republicans are described as elitist and backward if they are not willing to dilute their programme in the interest of this so called unity
3220177 it is true unity that is required to achieve the goal of irish freedom but it must be a real unity based on a common programme cohesive and coordinated and based on unequivocal republicanism
3220178 the republican movement provides such a programme it is the only vehicle which can deliver direction and leadership it has and remains in the words of d ith conaill the
3220179 the editorial of the united irishman in december 1957 pointed the way forward
3220180 by strict adherence to principles by pursuing a clearly defined policy by placing the national interest before personal considerations the irish republican movement has built up a reputation for honesty and integrity the irish people can put their trust in that movement sure in the knowledge that it will never betray them or their interests
3220181 the lessons are simple by sticking to the basic fundamentals of irish republicanism is the only means to ensure unity of purpose whilst delivering a clear and coherent message to the irish people
3220182 drawing our inspiration from the memory of richard goss and his comrades let us set about building a mass movement of the irish people capable of delivering a 32 county democratic socialist republic
3220183 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3220184 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3220185 the process has already been protracted and so it is already clear that this administration is not going to be able to achieve its stated goal
3220186 that means that the next administration is going to inherit this problem and it may be possibly what dprk north korea had intended all along
3220187 me and my wife were asleep i woke up and all the people in the bus fell to one side
3220188 i keep trying to pull my wife out and she says help me
3220189 she was stuck in the chair or something there were people on top of her it was people locked together
3220190 she knows nothing one eye is covered she has stitches on the side of her head we just prayed
3220191 next week i can go back to work i think im not sure
3220192 we are no strangers to floods to local fires its just hard
3220193 thats why im trying to give 120 percent im in it for the short term they still have a long road ahead
3220194 i am disappointed in the quarters results while these results are driven by the declines in sales in a challenging economy and retail environment we still believe the company should continue to transition to its new business model we will be focusing on reducing costs to match our present level of revenue improving our supply chain and product offerings and driving the initiatives necessary to complete our transition the business model transition may result in future impairments of certain assets restructuring charges as well as operating losses
3220195 i am confident that using our company and industry veterans like frank kane bill massengill and mike hanna in new and expanded roles will positively benefit the company
3220196 in my view our poor performance is not the result of poor economic conditions much of our operating shortfall i believe is the result of our own lack of execution as a company that began in the midst of the great depression we have a deep heritage from one of the great american brands and are fortunate to have attracted committed and passionate employees benefits that we believe will allow us once again to become a thriving chain
3220197 while working through these difficult market conditions in the first half of the year we focused our efforts on fixed and variable cost reduction and the successful implementation of lean principles throughout the entire organization as we position the company for uncertain economic conditions for the remainder of the year we also improved our balance sheet by paying down a significant portion of our borrowings and raising equity in a private placement and a rights offering
3220198 moving into the second half of the year we plan to mitigate the slowness in the rv and mh industries through continued focus on cost containment continuous improvement and lean operating initiatives at all levels of the organization to maximize our improved market position gained from the adorn acquisition
3220199 when we first purchased adorn llc we felt this was a transformational event for both companies and the first important step in patrick industries inc becoming the premier manufacturer and distributor of building and component products to the rv and mh industries and we are pleased with our progress so far
3220200 since the acquisition in may 2007 we have closed and consolidated ten operations and two operating cells and reduced our headcount by 640 including 70 salaried positions we continue to see significant synergies from the acquisition and estimate our annualized cost savings in 2008 to be more than 3 million during the first half of 2008 we estimate we have already realized approximately 1 5 million in combined annualized cost savings from the integration
3220201 with our leaner combined operations stronger management team and improving balance sheet we have repositioned patrick over the first six months of 2008 to compete in the currently difficult rv and mh markets we are also in a better position to execute our long term strategic plan based on market penetration enhanced capacity utilization improving operating efficiencies product development and strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities
3220202 this truly is a historic moment the safe destruction of the vx stockpile at newport represents the culmination of years of dedication and commitment on the part of the chemical materials agency the newport chemical depot and our employees as a part of the necdf team we have made a difference we have made the world a safer and better place
3220203 thoughtful and rigorous debate might be the ultimate moral act

3220205 the client has come to us and have asked for a number of changes to the gt system over a period of time these changes are completed and placed into qa gt gt uat now the client is happy with 3 out of the 4 changes that you have gt made and has requested that these changes go live straight away but the gt 4th needs some more tweaking
3220206 most of the main roads in the provinces are covered with thick a layer of mud from landslides so it is very difficult for vehicles to move around
3220207 from 1935 onwards they became enemies of the people infiltrators and spies a tiny handful such as paul robeson a singer were tolerated as propaganda trophies the rest sank into a living hades of torture rape slave labour starvation frostbite and death shared with millions of others
3220208 to generate sufficient advertising revenues to sustain its ongoing operation
3220209 were going to smash them thats what we came for
3220210 what makes it especially difficult for the consumer is that they cant compare prices because every airline has a different
3220211 one airline might seem like its the cheapest one but in the end once you add up all the fees it might be the most expensive
3220212 take an airline like air tran which is a low cost carrier
3220213 theyre pretty good the only fee they have is a 10 fee for your second checked bag
3220214 say youre traveling with a family of four times 200 isnt so bad
3220215 but once you get into about 360 then it becomes almost unaffordable
3220216 when it comes to protecting our kids i thought i was protecting them
3220217 he was traveling to mexico to engage in sex with minor boys
3220218 never imagining in a million years that that somebody was very well educated he was a dentist very community oriented a super volunteer and he was living in our home
3220219 dont ever post personal information dont ever post pictures ever it is on the internet for all time
3220220 the schools are still ramping up and thats why we want to become involved to help push out some cutting edge training to get a handle on this
3220221 theyre going where their kids are and where their parents arent and thats the internet
3220222 even if you live in a gated community with an alarm system a child alone in a room with a computer and the internet is just as vulnerable as a child living in a least safe community
3220223 if this could happen in our world where we live and our lifestyle and right under our noses without anyone knowing it including me it can happen to anybody
3220224 i was in downtown dallas and i accidentally got in the hov and i had to go for miles before i could get off it was really frustrating
3220225 for a stretch as long as there is in richardson which is over five miles it doesnt make sense for the commuter to have to exit in plano to access a richardson work place
3220226 right now we dont have many options and it can be quite frustrating when were trying to drive somewhere and find an exit point
3220227 i began to see the most clearly i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional
3220228 i had been so unhappy and i realised that i had just been literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly
3220229 faith and i have joked about doing on golden pond on broadway when we get older
3220230 the idea of me being a crotchety old dude im not far from that now
3220231 i dont think i took enough classes reacting to five other people is completely different than being with an acting coach
3220232 im a horrible driver and my first day on set i had to drive a car and act at the same time i was thinking about too many things at once i almost ran over the girl that i was talking to it was just a mess
3220233 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes
3220234 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3220235 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop
3220236 i bruised my rib and you know how that goes if you get a rib bruise it lasts for about six weeks of not being able to breathe all the way in its such a drag
3220237 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks
3220238 he walks through the whole barracks and gets to the end of the barracks and theres john malkovich and joe pantoliano and me its a six minute shot and then i screwed up my line
3220239 im like i just yelled cut because i screwed up and hes yelling no no you never cut i literally turned white and shrunk because my hero and idol steven spielberg is yelling at me
3220240 i learned you never yell cut as an actor the director yells cut for years i lived with this shame but weve laughed about it since because he remembers it too i was mortified
3220241 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
3220242 it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child
3220243 im not a moderate person and ill be the first to say there have been times when things were taken to the extreme
3220244 i got really fat i want to take care of myself

3220246 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3220247 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3220248 encourages passengers to report any mishaps that come from flying on the nations second largest carrier
3220249 weve started this website because were tired of seeing the tilton organization play the blame game to glenn and his staff responsibility for uniteds predicament belongs to everyone and everything other than themselves
3220250 the unions call for tiltons departure widens the rift between the worlds second largest airline and its pilots
3220251 it started to come as the game went along but its those mental errors weve got to get rid of
3220252 i think it was a good learning experience for us
3220253 he was a big part of our offense last year and hes a very good player were missing him but we have to do what we have to do when hes not here
3220254 after two series its really hard to judge it was tough to get into a rhythm
3220255 mentally going into a game knowing youre only playing two series is really hard to play a football game that way
3220256 i think at the beginning i was more nervous but after a couple of series i was able to calm down
3220257 over all im satisfied with what i did as far as scoring a touchdown but not satisfied with my overall game
3220258 men scarcely ever base their happiness on the real blessings of life as they mount so do their ambitions as for true happiness they draw further and further away from it the blessings and peace of mind and independence based on modest and easily satisfied aspirations are denied to them their time is at every mans command and they waste their lives in futile occupations so long as such men can feel the dignity of wearing ermine and silken robes and provided that the wind of favour blows in their direction and supports them they will wear themselves out among dusty papers gladly devoting themselves to other peoples business to be a minister of state or a president is a risky position for it not only endangers a mans peace of mind but his reputation as well and puts his character to a severe test unless he can rely upon his conscience he will come to grief amidst the every increasing dangers to which he is exposed

3220265 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3220266 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3220267 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3220268 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3220270 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3220271 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3220272 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3220273 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3220274 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3220275 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3220276 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3220277 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3220278 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3220279 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3220280 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3220281 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3220282 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3220283 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3220284 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3220285 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3220286 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3220287 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3220288 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3220289 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3220290 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3220291 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3220292 i think there is a good reason why the propaganda system works that way it recognizes that the public will not support the actual policies therefore it is important to prevent any knowledge or understanding of them
3220293 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3220294 turkey has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3220295 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
3220296 but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle

3220318 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3220319 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3220320 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3220333 i need to think for a little bit would it be okay if we put on some of my music now
3220334 now i understand why jimi hendrix is so popular the music defined a generation in turmoil you should that its disturbing music indicative of struggles and discontent
3220335 twenty years ago i was at a wedding and i heard rabbi freifeld say something that i felt was offensive to my
3220336 a week later i received a letter from rabbi freifeld
3220337 eu tive at que pedir sapatos para fazer campanha porque eu ando muito e os meus estavam furados
3220338 pero me preocupa que se meta esa gente de miami
3220339 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3220340 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3220341 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3220342 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirises hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3220343 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3220344 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3220345 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3220346 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3220347 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3220348 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3220349 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3220350 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3220351 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3220352 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3220353 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3220354 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3220355 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3220356 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3220357 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3220358 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3220359 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3220360 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3220361 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3220362 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3220363 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3220364 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3220365 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3220366 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3220367 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3220368 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3220369 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3220370 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3220371 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3220372 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3220373 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3220374 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3220375 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3220376 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3220377 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3220378 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3220379 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3220380 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3220381 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3220382 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3220383 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3220384 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3220385 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3220386 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3220387 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3220388 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3220389 el registro documental y el ritmo pausado de un testimonio intimo
3220390 conviven con el ritmo del clip y la m sica que acompa a la totalidad de la pel cula

3220393 my astrologer had told me to always have a packed bag next to my door so i could make a quick escape
3220394 thats always the most difficult question to answer there was that call i had to come i had no choice
3220395 i came here to help in building the city of the future i do have some problems with commitment though
3220396 its not that im irresponsible if i say ill do something i really try my best to do it if i have to be somewhere and do a job ill be there and do it its just that i dont like to be fenced in i have so many different interests and i want to be free to pursue them for that reason ive taken on a lot of temporary jobs dropping in and out wherever and whenever im needed and contributing my time and my skills
3220397 that was the time the music virus infected me to the point of no return
3220398 the dj is basically the main host of the evening if people like the music the party is usually a success of course i have my own style and tastes in music but i also try to bring in variety to have something for everyone
3220399 it would be a place where people can have fun and dance and not only the young older people love to dance too
3220400 and having her buy my piece amongst many others was kind of flattering
3220401 it is quite demanding physically first crushing the rock to make it into powder and then carrying pots filled with water around pouring them into tanks mixing the water into the clay then sieving the clay and putting it out to dry during the first month i came home totally exhausted every evening
3220402 and sometimes i have trouble concentrating on what im doing but in spite of that slowly im getting there at least i manage to throw a proper cylinder now what i dont like about these workshops though is that i have to make twenty yam cups or mugs or bottles and they all have to look the same how boring is that but they say you first have to learn the technique and then you can be creative do whatever you want get wild and i know thats the first step but i just wish it didnt take so long when i model my heads i take a ball of clay i play around with it and then the head is there it is born and i probably will never be able to reproduce it thats what i like most about pottery the creative process
3220403 of course ill continue to potter around as i enjoy it so much but i will see what other opportunities to serve the divine pop up next year
3220404 i explode very easily sometimes about small things but normally i also calm down very fast also india and especially auroville have taught me some very important lessons one of them is always touch your own nose mind your own business the other is never throw the first stone
3220405 evan gets to paraglide and hang from the bottom of a helicopter
3220406 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3220407 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3220408 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3220409 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3220410 ich m chte nicht mehr mit der kelly family verwechselt werden

3220419 ich lehne religion als institution ab religion sollte durch das individuum leben die kirche hat alle weisheit und wahrheit verleugnet ver ndert falsch bersetzt sie hat die menschen der selbstverantwortung beraubt verspricht heil durch ablassbrief und busse
3220420 why dont you go on to kiss the ring on the finger of the hand which turned your existence to hell
3220421 g be es die katholische kirche nicht w re ich christ so sehe ich meine parallelen im buddhismus
3220422 ich bin ein mann der die m nnlich weibliche polarit t erkannt und akzeptiert hat
3220423 you are like the ocean and im like the moonlight it seems im only reflecting on your surface but you know i reach your ground
3220424 love is what i believe in and freedom is what i need but why do i suffer from love and why am i not freee

3220431 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3220432 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3220433 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3220434 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3220435 i want a nice road i want that the cars let people pass i dont like that there is no space
3220436 a footpath wound through peanuts fields but bullock carts and cars took the better mud road through the canyon towards pondy the bommaiyapalayam road that connects the villages on the east coast road with the villages on the tindivanam road a road that goes through kuilapalayam and edyanchavadi was tarred and paid for by the government of tamil nadu around the end of the 80s see map the present road that runs from kuilapalayam down to the ecr did not exist in the early 1980s people from kuilapalayam had a meeting to discuss the need for a new road then at pongal time everyone who could hold a mumpti or crowbar met and in an action directe constructed a new road which ran straight across the fields to the beach road the landowners who owned the land the new road was being laid across instantly came running trying to prevent the diggers and levelers from finishing their muddy business but they were told the work wouldnt stop the road was finished and the next morning the police were on the site the landowners from periyarmudaliarchavadi filed a case against the kuilapalayam elders who explained that they would compensate the owners they did this partly by collecting some contributions from their own people and from auroville and partly by giving some land in exchange also auroville donated the land over which some of the new road was laid
3220437 there were no plans no one really knew anything about correct measurements at that time the kuilapalayam auroville development council was established as a joint committee to monitor the road situation
3220438 something will happen only if we make petitions and exert soft pressure on the higher authorities but everyone involved should also cooperate some two years back the kottakupam town panchayat started to collect a toll at the entrances to auroville and repos beach to pay for road improvement but they stopped after 3 days as people complained and did not pay
3220439 during the last 20 years inys has often meant for me a yearly break an oasis an open space to recover from aurovilles unceasing pressures the intensity work the hassles and the total involvement it has helped me immensely in maintaining a balanced stance throughout these years
3220440 i just needed to get away from work pressure and detoxify
3220441 not an alcohol or drug detoxification but a stress detoxification emotional and physical stress does affect the body though you usually notice it much later
3220442 i came mainly for cleansing but i will certainly be happy to lose some kilos i appreciate their food a lot it is organically grown in the compound and prepared in a simple way
3220443 all these bodily exercises were overwhelming but being here is also about giving up and letting go once i realized that things got better i was surprised to enjoy yoga pranayama and above all massages
3220444 it would be good to do a cleansing before the hot season starts this sizzling indian climate makes the liver work overtime and we have to be very careful about the state of this precious organ
3220445 from the kitchen to the treatment section and even outdoors all the treatments are so nicely done with care and love people here really want you to be well
3220446 after all its fun to have your whole body covered with mud its so cooling i wouldnt do the colon hydrotherapy again though
3220447 the fact that its even economically feasible for aurovilian honorary voluntary workers to spend a few weeks here is an absolute blessing
3220448 there are simple double rooms costly rooms and very costly accommodation now they are even building the supernest where one hardly needs to leave the room anymore the jacuzzi is built in and you can get all the treatment in your own private space
3220449 you wont find the food as palatable as at home for this any five star hill station will do
3220450 after i came back from my first visit to india i confronted my parents with 3 new ideas 2 we are planning to have a baby and they recovered only slowly then their interest grew i knew that they would come and visit but i wasnt expecting them so soon
3220451 dust and dirt were the only things they could speak about for two hours after they arrived from madras consciously i didnt pick them up at the airport to give them a chance to have their own first impressions the traffic for germans this is very hard to digest how can our poor poor daughter survive in these circumstances they calmed down when they arrived at afsanahs guest house they seemed to glimpse light at the end of the tunnel
3220452 a thousand times a day i answer the same questions about the same issues which spiders are poisonous from what kind of mosquito can i get malaria are scorpion and snakebites deadly what do i do with the frog in my toilet bowl
3220453 after theyve invested so much in my education as an architect
3220454 hello you dont know me and i dont know you but you know somebody called riad ab del nabi
3220455 i am his mother in law annelies and i am at the centre guest house
3220456 then say hi to my friends alex and laurence who will be coming shortly to live there
3220457 next time you come call me up i am listed in the auroville telephone directory
3220458 hey what was the name of that indian town where your eldest son did his social service auroville yes i thought so jochen start researching here is your next story
3220459 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3220460 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3220461 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3220462 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3220463 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3220464 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3220465 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3220466 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3220467 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3220468 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3220469 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3220470 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3220471 ladies and friends this is a government place we are not even allowed to hit a nail into the wall so forget about cutting holes into the stage
3220472 he told me to look into his eyes and count till 10 and he had huge eyes so i counted and closed my eyes it was really weird i didnt feel a thing and i didnt know what happened until my parents told me later
3220473 my parents were a bit worried i was still dizzy and queasy i had felt something hitting my throat and even some days later that red mark was visible at its base i have no idea how he did it and i would not do it again then when i saw the second trick safely from my seat i thought well i should have stayed on but anyway i received a photo that shows him and me together on stage a nice memento
3220474 everyone who disappears is forming a new species somewhere over the rainbow
3220475 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3220476 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3220477 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3220478 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3220479 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3220480 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3220481 we have awakened from our r ve we have now agreed to call our community courage as this attribute of the mother was the only one of her twelve attributes that hasnt yet been used to name a community in auroville
3220482 aspiration one of the first settlements in auroville was a great experience in the early days no one really had their own house we had shared accommodation in huts and there was a community kitchen
3220483 the apartments had been planned and built without walls around the kitchen and terrace space so the first monsoon took its toll there were wet floors everywhere after my son kilan was born i decided to close the open space although i enjoyed being close to nature too many animals were part of the household and the wind constantly blew the gas stove out
3220484 my son sauman was born the day after we moved into courage slowly we converted the house to our liking and needs originally there was no bedroom door no proper windows poor ventilation a leaking ceiling and sweating walls i approached the housing service to rectify these mistakes they promised to take care of it but to this day nothing has been done so i had to take a loan which i am still repaying to do all the work myself
3220485 i had been involved at the design stage of phase i and had also agreed to be the site architect as construction began
3220486 in the end i feel it was a good attempt to create something new in auroville but i still feel that if our architects office had been allowed to supervise the project some of the basic construction errors might have been avoided
3220487 the water still smells from bacteria after many different tests i now concentrate on using various plants to clean the water but this doesnt always work well as people still put too much detergent in their water and dump everything in their toilets whether it is harmful or not each individual has to become more aware
3220488 in the course of that unbelievable village gang war two years back i became a target as i was acting as the police liaison at that time my family and i lived in acceptance and our house was isolated so we were forced to relocate for security reasons within a month i was told that courage was ready to receive us the community members had all been consulted and had agreed after we moved in i received more threats so we closed the balcony with a grill and the security board agreed that i would have a 24 hour guard for a few months
3220489 except for three or four residents the majority here are without financial means but when we have problems we all sit together and solve them i thank this community for receiving us
3220490 we took the decision to raise fuel prices finding no other way to reduce revenue losses
3220491 the hyperion power module was originally conceived to provide clean affordable power for remote industrial applications such as oil sands operations
3220492 yet the initial enthusiasm has been from those needing reliable electricity for communities the big question for the 21st century is how do we provide safe energy to those who need it indeed those developing nations who demand it without contributing to climate change todays safer proliferation resistant nuclear power technology is the answer but its not feasible for every community to be tied to a large nuclear power plant some communities those that need power for just the most basic humanitarian infrastructure such as clean water production for household use and irrigation are too remote for conventional nuclear power this is where the hyperion power module a safe secure transportable power generator can help
3220493 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3220494 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3220495 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3220496 the line was so long i was like what is this
3220497 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3220498 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3220499 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3220500 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3220501 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3220502 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3220503 his signs are really simple they are small it says want forgiveness a driver told cbs4
3220504 hes distracting drivers and im concerned for his safety as well as the safety of the drivers
3220505 youre not going to have a cake walk putting it through ive got lawyers im going to fight it chief
3220506 and also be on record that you are an enemy of jesus christ
3220507 they are singling me out they have it out for me and its because of the cross
3220508 my constitutional rights are being violated to express the greatest sacred treasure we have in the united states freedom of speech

3220510 our results are largely attributable to the economic environment the country is experiencing the downturn in the real estate market and the increased difficulties faced by our borrowers in obtaining take out financing has caused a number of our loans to become non performing or delinquent and has caused a decline in the underlying collateral securing the companys loan portfolio we are working aggressively to resolve our problem loans however this process will take time and our near term operating results are likely to suffer from the level of non performing assets

3220514 assembly member galgiani and the bi partisan coalition supporting assembly bill 3034 have done a tremendous job in strengthening the high speed train measure on this novembers election ballot with important taxpayer protections and tight cost controls since these improvements were requested and obtained by governor schwarzenegger with approval by every legislative committee that has reviewed them i believe the assembly will concur with the senates amendments and will pass ab 3034 and the governor will sign it in time to apply its provisions to the ballot measure that will assure the best plan for a high speed train system grounded in public private financing and guided by fiscal accountability with the guarantee of no new taxes to fund the system
3220515 there is no such thing of islamic law being above the federal constitution the federal constitution is the federal constitution there is a set of laws we have to follow it is something that we have to follow thats all
3220516 terutama sekali sewaktu agama islam di malaysia kini memang sedang cuba dipersenda sendakan oleh pihak yang sedang memilih untuk mempersendakannya
3220517 kalau perdana menteri tidak pernah berkata seperti yang dipetik oleh the sun tetapi hanya menyatakan seperti yang telah dipetik oleh bernama dan utusan malaysia maka akhbar the sun mestilah bertindak sewajarnya dengan seberapa segera sebelum api kemarahan umat islam memuncak dan membara akibat kesilapan strategik yang berkenaan
3220518 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3220519 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3220520 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3220521 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3220522 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3220523 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3220524 i think this should go back to our police officers
3220525 we should present them with this draft and let them chicken scratch at it that way we see whats good whats bad and whats ugly after that well bring it back
3220526 i think once the police officers give their input the ordinance will be fine tuned and given to council
3220527 some of the safety concerns would be their visibility and their slow speed
3220528 those are just a couple things i see as a problem off the top of my head

3220535 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3220536 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
3220537 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia
3220538 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
3220539 on request of the president of georgia the president of the republic of poland has provided the web site of the president of poland for dissemination of information
3220540 poti serves as a vital energy transit route to europe
3220541 over the past 48 hours russian forces have killed over 100 georgian civilians and soldiers after targeting residential complexes in georgia as well as airports bases and other vital infrastructure
3220542 we are delighted to commence work on the new campus the state government has worked at enhancing infrastructure facilities at hyderabad to make it a premier it destination globally
3220543 it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3220544 we believe that legal errors were made in this decision and we have every reason to believe that the circuit court will look at them afresh and hopefully agree with us
3220545 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3220546 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3220547 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3220548 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3220549 in the event that the foreign courts uphold those rulings ebays going to have to change the way it does business
3220550 if they have the ability to prevent counterfeiting in france and germany then clearly they have the ability to prevent it in the united states
3220551 there are other online sites that have to realize that theyve got to up their game and do at least what ebay is doing if they want to insulate themselves from liability
3220552 theres no question that ebay has taken a lot steps to take its marketplace clean of counterfeiting but there are literally thousands of counterfeited items for sale every day
3220553 if those auctions actually conclude ebay reaps a financial profit from that sale of a counterfeit item if youre gong to profit from it dont you already have some responsibility there

3220557 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3220558 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra us 10 a month
3220559 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3220560 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3220561 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3220562 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3220563 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3220564 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3220565 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3220566 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3220567 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3220568 weve really seen the emergence of semantic web from the research lab were just on the cusp of r amp d to a range of real world applications
3220569 semantic web has been around for a while now a lot of work has been done on the building blocks

3220776 i did martial arts since i was a little kid tae kwon do kickboxing and muay thai
3220777 i had a friend that did jiu jitsu at las vegas combat club he got me into it got me into ufc so i was a fan a little bit and then he kicked my butt one day so i signed up and started training
3220778 then id train in the morning go to school in the afternoon train at night and then work a little at night that was my schedule for a long time
3220779 when you really like something theres not much motivation for whatever reason grappling struck a chord with me the self motivation as i saw it was it being physical chess theres always something to get better at its a technical game that you learn when theres always some way to progress motivation is easy
3220780 after my first few months of training ricardo pires offered to let me mop the mats in order to pay my gym fees
3220781 from then on i was in twice a day everyday training as much as i could
3220782 school was between jiu jitsu but i was still able to do school full time thanks to my parents i got a millennium scholarship that helped
3220783 psychology was my desire to understand myself and understand sports psychology i picked a major that i thought would help jiu jitsu
3220784 i got to train with forrest griffin at las vegas combat club i trained with him a little for his shogun rua fight he picked me luckily to be a coach for the show and it was just great training i got to train with forrest everyday
3220785 actually i had a meeting this morning to talk about creating a partnership with arts factory and unlv
3220786 its good to get them out of the school environment so they can see what its like in the real world
3220787 i think its great because on campus only students see it its a good opportunity for others to see it
3220788 i found a statistic that most family fights happen in rooms with yellow interiors
3220789 it is a simple thing we can do to save energy and money and should be done immediately
3220790 students can make repeated trips to the food stations if they want more food so trays are completely unnecessary
3220791 honestly i dont see how having no trays will help the environment maybe it will save the school money but thats it
3220792 unlv dining is excited to partner with the university on their sustainability task force by participating in the nationwide trend of ongoing sustainability initiatives
3220793 every day the dining commons participates in trayless dining roughly 400 gallons of water are saved and 300 pounds of food dont go to waste
3220794 electricity water and chemical usage are reduced because there are far fewer dishes and trays to wash
3220795 this can save hundreds of gallons of water every day and generate hundreds of dollars in detergent and electricity savings
3220796 what sodexho should do is look at the food served throughout campus
3220797 they are responsible for all catering events on campus and a lot of the food served in the student union can we compost food waste or send it to compost facilities can we regulate the take out containers so that they are made from compostable materials can we get locally produced food or organically produced
3220798 it is the smallest step on a much longer journey to greening our food services on campus
3220799 i think for judah to win hes got to get to him early and establish himself from the beginning he has the speed advantage and hes got to use it
3220800 this is the most concentration the most intensity ive seen since ive been here and im going into my fourth year its a good situation
3220801 its good to have competition for the quarterback spot each person wants to start and you need a strong quarterback a strong leader to control the offense
3220802 my backup michael clausen is a redshirt freshman hes doing a great job out here at practice our competition stays on the field but he does a great job hes going to be a real good quarterback
3220803 we are looking to prove to everyone and ourselves that we can and will do well this season
3220804 it seems like i was in camp just the other day last year camp seems to go by a little bit slow and as games go by its an awesome time the first game will be exciting
3220805 they see the athletes competing but they really get involved in terms of the atmosphere its really high charged a lot of tension
3220806 our students are passionate about rebel athletics and we have been seeing bigger and bigger crowds from our student population at our games over the past few years
3220807 sports fans in general are especially passionate when rivalries exist and i think unlvs feud with unr increases the excitement for everyone including our students
3220808 the week before the game unr goes all out and has unlv bashing activities i didnt really see that at unlv as much
3220809 nearly every aspect of student life is permeated by the nuances of our rivalry in building our new student union we were explicit that no red was to be used in any area of the building in fact that went so far that when one vendor was interested in leasing space in the union they had to contact their national headquarters to receive permission to change the colors of their company at that location because it contained red
3220810 ive gone to both schools and i really dont think the rivalry goes much beyond the
3220811 i do feel a need for competition with unr simply because it makes unlv feel less like a commuter school and more like a university with campus pride and spirit
3220812 i want our student population to get involved and be proud of their school
3220813 csun president adam cronis and myself are in frequent communication on the budget issues and though we often joke about it we work well together in strategizing our response to the cuts the budget issues supersede any rivalry between our universities
3220814 i didnt want the group to be exclusive because the budget cuts are something that effects all the schools in nevada
3220815 the rivalry is always healthy but we have enough sense that when there is a common threat we will unite and help each other out
3220816 in 1936 a german athlete named dora ratjen finished fourth in the womens high jump twenty years later ratjen disclosed that he was in fact hermann ratjen and that the nazis had forced him to compete as a woman
3220817 you cant really be a woman if you are doing so well
3220818 the lady decided to finally stop and i went flying somewhere around 20 feet in front of the car before i could figure out exactly what was going on the police ambulance and fire department were already there
3220819 you will sometimes see metro motor units motorcycles conducting enforcement actions using a plainclothes officer posing as a pedestrian
3220820 the officer signals a motorcycle unit when a motorist fails to yield in the crosswalk
3220821 even driving i feel like it is hard to tell when someone is crossing
3220822 the few times that i have used the crosswalk i had to watch out for cars as i was walking because they did not even slow down or stop
3220823 i think a midtown unlv project report which suggested adding in ground lights and a change of paving material can help make the crosswalk more visible to drivers
3220824 to be honest i wouldnt be able to go to school without the scholarship
3220825 ways to promote the campaigns success stories to the campus
3220826 hes every other lamp post for 100 yards in the quad
3220827 it makes me feel like all the work im putting into school and debate is giving me accomplishments
3220828 its a very generous amount and my accomplishments have earned me the scholarship
3220829 we have to look at research in different ways these days
3220830 las vegas is one of those places people come when they have an idea in mind
3220831 its kind of fun to get recognized for some of the things i did last year and this year
3220832 its all fun and games but you just have to work towards the end goal in the mountain west
3220833 theyre leaders on our team they have a tremendous attitude they work hard and they practice well as i would expect them to
3220834 this is the first time having a quarterback named as starter before the beginning of camp
3220835 so its kind of easy to get our flow together and start getting on the same page
3220836 were going to have to win a lot of games
3220837 next guy who doesnt drive the whistle owes push ups intensity lets go
3220838 everyones really excited we cant wait to get back to it
3220839 ive been working out every day all summer mostly just focusing on football
3220840 we love day one were ready to get down to business
3220841 its beautiful these kids have been so lucky we dont have to worry as much about heat related injuries
3220842 a lot of them find that a set schedule works well for them they know when they gotta do things each day and they get em done
3220843 our league is well balanced i think each school is really positive and thinks it has a chance to win which is good
3220844 we dont have 20 kids its nice to get into the mid 30s
3220845 it looks a lot better it looks like a football team
3220846 and thats with only three sophomores on the varsity its a lot better than weve had here
3220847 this is just really an extension of the camp we ran in july
3220848 what im trying to do is implement as much as we can were going to a lot of meetings walk through and two practices were handing out playbooks
3220849 we want to get that done so when we get to thursday we can just practice
3220850 we offered the united states a comprehensive deal putting all the cases in one package but we want them to compensate the libyan victims of the u s strike this is our condition and they must satisfy it
3220851 one of the worst times in my familys life together was the united states bombing raid on tripoli and benghazi the two biggest cities in libya in 1986 i was only 14 at the time and my family were all together in our home in tripoli one night without any warning the bombers came and for five minutes rained rockets down on us i was woken up by loud crashing sounds and explosions it was absolutely terrifying our house had been directly hit i knew that we had to go to a shelter which had been built within the house sadly some of my brothers and sisters were too young to know what to do and they became trapped in one part of the house when a corridor collapsed they were stuck there until the rescue services arrived and when we dug them out we found that hannah my youngest sister had died she was just four years old

3220854 con los resultados del referendo revocatorio es importante que los prefectos y actores pol ticos reconozcan de una buena vez la legitimidad que tiene este proceso de cambio

3220856 el gobierno boliviano est en la obligaci n de buscar otros recursos para invertir
3220857 habl con algunos embajadores de europa de latinoam rica donde esas empresas son de esos pa ses y si no invierten vamos a recuperar y tenemos que invertir
3220858 yo me acuerdo del ex presidente de argentina n stor kirchner cuando visit tarija dijo si no quieren invertir algunas empresas ll mame levanta el tel fono yo te garantizo la inversi n
3220859 im not allowed to discuss the condition of my injuries
3220860 i think thats something that youve got to talk to coach brad childress about or the trainers
3220861 it just makes us so much better from a coverage standpoint
3220862 hell be a tremendous asset this is the type of safety you look for in the draft a guy who can hit but still has coverage ability as well
3220863 you would like to get those reps and get that chemistry going but hes a veteran player
3220864 im hoping he wont be on the shelf that long
3220865 he has been playing faster than when we were in organized team activities when we were going through installation
3220866 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3220867 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3220868 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3220869 this colorful portable wood lemonade stand on wheels is easy to assemble and is perfect for the young entrepreneur the stand is constructed of hardwood panels 2 colorful oversized wheels chalkboard front panel dry erase counter top and a colorful fabric awning
3220870 oops maybe in retrospect i shouldnt have killed all those guys when i was a teenager
3220871 well maybe a cosmic ray hits one of the transistors in the calculator and it says 1959 instead of 1957 thats an error
3220872 if it was just those two calculators i wouldnt know for sure which was right but here ive got nine other calculators that all say 1957 so it certainly seems probable that 1957 is the correct answer
3220873 because if i have to predict the outcome of any other calculators that compute 19 x 103 or the number of pebbles in a 19 x 103 array ill predict 1957 or whatever observable outcome corresponds to the abstract number 1957
3220874 the pragmatic answer is that we can obtain extremely strong evidence by looking at the results of a hundred calculators even if they are only 90 likely to be correct on any one occasion
3220875 physically departed from the model that i had of it
3220876 physically departed from the idealized question that i had in mind
3220877 how many pebbles would i have if i had a rectangular array of six lines like this one
3220878 should i cut the red wire or the green wire
3220879 whichever wire does in fact defuse the bomb that is the wire that should be cut
3220880 bob and sally could be talking about different things when they talk about enamuh
3220881 whats the difference between a world where theyre talking about different things vs a world where they are talking about the same thing but one of them is miscalculating what facts about their dispositions and such would determine which of the two explanations holds on your view
3220882 someone sees a slave being whipped and it doesnt occur to them right away that slavery is wrong
3220883 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3220884 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3220885 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3220886 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3220887 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3220895 old age pensioners are getting 273 a week which is poverty level and we have been challenging the last government which did nothing to get pensioners to get a decent hike
3220896 at this point its water under the bridge theres no reason to dwell on it
3220897 im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3220898 its getting better unfortunately its a slower process than i would hope it would be but im making strides in the right direction
3220899 obviously hes very questionable wed like to get him to the point where he can operate at full speed again

3220902 what am i going to say its the unfortunate part of the business thats what this sport is it has two sides its obviously a game for all of those who play on the field and who love to play the game but there is a business side too
3220903 so what this isnt telling me anything i didnt already know after all who supplied the information in the first place
3220904 can and should take control of their own health and health care
3220905 what medications am i taking in what doses what are they for and how much do they cost
3220906 what vaccinations even on a clear day its not possible to see the chicago skyline from dartmouth but the dartmouth experts behind an innovative website can see aggregate health information on 100 000 patients in chicago and other cities across the country do i need to keep track of and where can i get reliable information in a form i can understand so i can talk about my health in an informed way
3220907 how many of my patients have feelings of depression that they havent told me about
3220908 how does my handling of allergies compare with that of other doctors

3220910 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3220911 ustedes ver n que ciertamente detr s de eso ha habido muchas cosas y hay muchas responsabilidades
3220912 i remember our portugal ec two years back we started slowly and lacklustre there too and won but we will have to up our game against japan big time thats one thing thats clear
3220913 i want the recovery time to be maximal this group is so eager and hungry on the training but the batteries are dead too early in the match
3220914 my biggest problem with this team is that most lads arent capable of looking beyond their own performance
3220915 its not that they dont want to because they give it their all but they cant find the solutions on the pitch i told drenthe many times to stay deep and keep the pitch long but he keeps on dropping back to pick up the ball and trying to force a solution with the ball on the foot no wonder he isnt able to finish the game and hes not the only one
3220916 its more of like the right thing to do thats the way i put it
3220917 if our school got messed up id want people to come down and help us too
3220918 i thought it would be good to help the community of chapman and help them rebuild the city and stuff and help them get ready for school
3220919 because if that would ever happen to me i would want other schools to help and i would be very thankful for that
3220920 we drove through chapman and you dont really see whats really happened from the outside of it but when you come into the town you see all the destruction and stuff so yeah i feel really good about helping
3220921 its something to be honest i never thought would happen to me or to us id never seen what destruction a tornado can do and it was a real eye opener and its really something else
3220922 i feel good i think its going to help them get back together
3220923 hopefully they can get back on the basketball court and play sports and get everything back to normal this year and if they do id feel even better about that
3220924 all we need is one big bat and were in business
3220925 now we just need saito to get back to closing

3220958 i know some people who thought i had turned usa basketball down
3220959 but that simply wasnt the case there was just never any genuine interest from our national team
3220960 this position point guard is a big problem for us this is why the russian federation did the russian passport for her because we needed a good player at point guard
3220961 so its good for her and its good for us
3220962 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
3220963 in the 60s and 70s the history of russia and america there was some tension there
3220964 if i was playing for some small country that nobody had heard of it would be different
3220965 people are just people what you learn is that russian parents love their kids just like american parents love theirs
3220966 im just thankful that they have accepted me with open arms
3220967 you have to extend a little grace to them i dont have a right to control other peoples opinions
3220968 this has been a growth process for me too i think ill come out of this being a better person and a stronger person
3220969 its the dream of every athlete to come to the olympics
3220970 if she has a chance to achieve a medal whether its with the russian team or the u s team she should get that opportunity

3220972 we need to stand on each others shoulders in order to reach our common goal
3220973 we are very pleased to receive the approval of the planning commission
3220974 we reduced the scale of the building notably by reducing the size of the gables five to six to seven feet on the north elevation and eight feet on the west elevation
3220975 our responsibility is to make sure that theyre so excited and that weve captured their attention that they dont want to leave
3220976 were going to have a lot of fun tonight were just doing a lot of activities and leadership building things were not going to sleep so were not even calling it a sleep in its just a lock in and we have a lot of cool activities planned

3220980 but i am not your enemy if you have a child on the spectrum and are hoping to cure him or her hoping to get rid of the autism i don t want to argue with you most likely you and i don t even use the word autism to mean the same thing if you are one of these parents working to change your child know that i am working too if your quest to change the course of autism fails perhaps the quest to change societal attitudes will fare better in which case your autistic child might have a less hostile world to live in that is why i do this

3220985 does an individual have a right to own a gun in america
3220986 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms we also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms
3220987 the gun was a bottom loading weapon and according to their interpretation all bottom loading guns are outlawed because they are grouped with machine guns
3220988 there are clear limits to the scope of judicial power

3220996 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why should remain a national delegate
3220997 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3220998 it sounded very totalitarian i thought it sounded undemocratic and i was completely shocked
3220999 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3221000 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee
3221001 if someone brings you private correspondence youll use that in investigating a complaint
3221002 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3221003 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3221004 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3221005 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3221006 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up
3221007 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3221008 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3221009 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3221010 the day the hurricane hit a belief he recently reaffirmed
3221011 a ny 12 year old with a laptop could have vetted this preacher in 30 seconds tops
3221012 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3221013 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3221014 believes that it is critically important for the united states to rebuild its national transportation infrastructure its highways bridges roads ports air and train systems to strengthen user safety bolster our long term competitiveness and ensure our economy continues to grow
3221015 voracious critic of how congress loads up infrastructure spending bills with pet projects for members and special interests
3221016 the status quo increasingly looks like a precarious option relying on existing networks and systems will only hamstring future growth and compromise sustainability this country simply cannot afford to keep treating infrastructure as an afterthought
3221017 unfortunately the infrastructure debate in this country only moves forward when catastrophic examples occur of the state of our bridges roads airports and water systems
3221018 if we are going to address this issue and be in a position to challenge rampant economies such as china over the next few decades we have to take a much more considered and holistic approach and not wait for another structure to collapse we need to create a mindset to have the will to build
3221019 it the bill targets specifically large capacity building projects that are not adequately served by current financing mechanisms the proposed infrastructure bank act also will increase the ability of the private sector to play a central role in infrastructure provision
3221020 the legislation we are introducing establishes a new system through which the federal government can finance infrastructure projects by leveraging private and public capital to fund large projects that are vital to our country this legislation provides a new model for prioritizing the building and maintenance of our national infrastructure
3221021 ive got a friend who is pro liberty you should talk to him

3221024 oh okay so maybe the american jackboots arent worse than nazis
3221025 yep theres proof both the nazis and the american jackboots do this
3221026 this is a massive tragedy for the people of burma
3221027 very quickly we can assist in remedial efforts on the ground
3221028 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3221029 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3221030 our nations immigration system is broken and without comprehensive immigration reform our nations security will remain vulnerable that is why we must act
3221031 i understand why you would call it a quote shift
3221032 i say it is a lesson learned about what the american peoples priorities are and their priority is to secure the borders
3221033 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
3221034 ich w rde mir sehr w nschen dass meine athleten einfach besser mit dem druck umgehen sie m ssen endlich lernen psychisch und physisch auf den punkt topfit zu sein
3221035 die heimtrainer haben meine trainingspl ne nicht konsequent befolgt die h hentrainingslager wurden nicht durchgezogen meine anweisungen nicht immer bedingungslos befolgt
3221036 in erfolgreichen schwimm nationen werden die trainingsinhalte innovativ kreativ und individuell gestaltet dort werden die inhalte nicht f r alle athleten verpflichtend von oben verordnet
3221037 ich kann ja nichts daf r dass uns die weltelite derart enteilt ist
3221038 nat rlich bin ich entt uscht dass es hier f r mich zu ende geht aber ich habe schon vor monaten gemerkt dass ich motivations probleme habe
3221039 vor 17 000 zuschauern ist man nat rlich immer ganz besonders motiviert da macht das schwimmen ganz besonders viel spa
3221040 ich w rde mir schon w nschen dass wir mit mehr mut in die wettk mpfe gehen ohne mut gewinnt man hier gar nichts
3221041 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3221042 the democrat leaders of the house and senate are attempting to jam a 200 plus billion dollar spending bill through the congress with absolutely no oversight or scrutiny by a vast majority of members senators or their constituents
3221043 never in my 30 years in congress has there been such an abuse of the processes and rules of the house
3221044 matias joined us last year and made an immediate impact to improve our team
3221045 he is a good player and a great teammate unfortunately with the emergence of jamison olave matias would have had a diminished role in the team going forward and we felt we should allow him to pursue other opportunities we wish him all the best and thank him for his service to real salt lake
3221046 for me the hamptons are all about being in my bathing suit all day and barbecuing with my family
3221047 it was a must win game because of the circumstances
3221048 we have to put ourselves in a playoff position and today was very important i said that today was the most important game because it was the next one now the most important game is against toronto next sunday and if we show the character we showed today i think we have a decent chance of getting the results from now on
3221049 we couldnt get a grip of the game at the beginning in the first 15 minutes
3221050 then they scored a goal that wasnt the best case scenario for us we didnt want to concede a goal early but it happened then we showed something that we havent showed earlier in the year we showed character and resilience we won a very difficult game against a decent side
3221051 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3221052 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3221053 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3221054 i knew something or somebody did something to him i dont know what i dont know if i ever want to know the details
3221055 these people are being placed in the water thrown in the water theres no marks its just preposterous to think that all these men are going to come from bars and just walk into the water
3221056 its not just a mom trying to find an easy answer definitely i know that especially with the series the other boys that have been killed
3221057 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3221058 the time to look is during the dark hours before dawn on tuesday august 12th
3221059 there should be plenty of meteors perhaps one or two every minute

3221063 and it will be a treasure for the rest of my life
3221064 the one thing they do with all of their athletes is drive them into the ground with training the strongest survive if you dont theyll find another to come and do it
3221065 i mean they dont do little things like block out good airline seats for them when they travel they can all be in middle seats in coach for all they care and thats how yao travels with them whatever happens with his injuries theyre going to insist that he keeps playing for them
3221066 it felt like a storybook when he hit that shot
3221067 therefore i am requesting that my position be eliminated in december instead of june
3221068 teachers are getting laid off but god forbid that pete iverson should miss a couple months off his retirement
3221069 the depravity of a system that lines the pockets of someone with such a highly paid post its just appalling
3221070 it is inappropriate and it sets double standards that wed allow someone to stay an extra six months in this district while we lay off people whose contracts end on the first of july and we dont consider their retirement benefits or anything else
3221071 when school is out we have to work hard to get everything done luckily there are no challenges we have not been able to overcome
3221072 the issue for me is the opportunity that mr iverson has been afforded versus how our classified employees are treated
3221073 theyre bending over backwards to help a manager secure a retirement pension while our workers who get textbooks to kids are laid off
3221074 i believe that theres a legitimate issue about whether you can transfer the money in the way that its contemplated
3221075 were using redevelopment to be able to move forward theres no plan we use the river as our back alley its a travesty i think we can do better and we will
3221076 thats the 600 million question but you have to always preserve all options in a redevelopment area
3221077 i dont want to use it just for roads not for private development
3221078 obviously we have a beautiful trolley station there in grantville and now theyve got a destination c street is the area where we have the greatest need for improvements itll beautify a destination from grantville
3221079 but none of that money will be available if the project area is not a redevelopment area
3221080 for grantville i dont think its such a good outcome
3221081 they sold the redevelopment to this area based on the fact that the money would stay here and the first place its going is to downtown
3221082 i dont understand why bad things always happen to me
3221083 i love it when he helps out around the house
3221084 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
3221085 its become the biggest selling item in the 30 year history of our store
3221086 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
3221087 we want to get people to ask the big questions without bashing them over the head
3221088 the poetry is giving us another version of the nanoparticle story
3221089 the idea is that you should be free from any financial interest in decisions being made by government
3221090 entities that you receive income from or that you have an investment in should not be benefiting from your decision even if youre not benefiting directly the philosophy is that your decision should be made for the benefit of the community
3221091 we did not want to make all of our records public
3221092 we had to basically go to jacksonville fla to find a judge that would not
3221093 that would all be dependent on whether the review finds anything
3221094 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him
3221095 not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source theres just not a nicer way to say it
3221096 they just didnt know any better and he was on the floor incapacitated for a couple of days and became of victim of that
3221097 once i had to call 911 because he came over and collapsed in our front yard and so they came and took him away and there was nobody there at the home
3221098 according to what one of the officers said there was quite a lot of feces and everything just in the rooms which is a nightmare
3221099 are the regulations enforced when are people inspected are they inspected often enough
3221100 well the periodics generally happen on about a three year cycle
3221101 so at this point to say we need to go out and revisit it would be a little premature we really dont know whats happened at the site yet
3221102 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music

3221107 joseph e wideners hialeah park race track recently revamped and beautified at a cost of approximately 1 300 000 will inaugurate its 1932 season tomorrow as thoroughbreds thunder down the stretch in the first seven races of a 38 day meeting
3221108 the opening will be a gala affair and a fashion parade for members of the winter resort colonies along the florida coast
3221109 the meeting will end feb 27 with the running of the 10 000 florida derby
3221110 there is a possibility that tropical park will not reopen until feb 29 to prevent conflict with the hialeah dates but this has not been announced officially
3221111 an australia totalizator built for mr widener at a cost of 300 000 and used in connection with pari mutuel wagering systems legalized in florida in 1931 will be a feature of the hialeah race meeting
3221112 approximately 800 horses are stabled at the widener track on the outskirts of miami ready to enter the seven race programs they represent the nations most prominent stables
3221113 the beautification program at hialeah park was undertaken by mr widener after the florida legislature legalized racing and pari mutuel wagering last summer over the veto of governor doyle carlton a total of 20 000 tropical trees shrubs and vines were placed to make the plant a tropic bower the mile and a quarter racing strip circles an artificial lake dotted with small islands while walks and driveways are lined with royal palms and australian pine trees
3221114 in 1931 and 1932 a great expansion of horse racing took place in various sections of the country all directly traceable to mr wideners pioneering in florida

3221177 our ancient sages affirm that sincere repentance and works of lovingkindness charity are the real intercessors before gods throne tb shabbat 32a and that sincere repentance is the equivalent to the rebuilding of the temple the restoration of the altar and the offering of all the sacrifices tb sanhedrin 43b in terms of jewish understanding of the sacrificial rites in the temple while the blood of the sacrifice did indeed represent life it was seen precisely in a representational role symbolizing the complete yielding up of the worshippers life to god hertz pentateuch and haftorahs we can only atone for our own sins and are responsible for our own actions

3221207 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3221208 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa

3221225 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3221226 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3221227 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3221228 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them

3221232 aku memberinya kekerasan untuk membuatnya tetap tegar ketika orang orang lain menyerah dan mengasuh keluarganya dengan penderitaan dan kelelahan tanpa mengeluh
3221233 aku memberinya kepekaan untuk mencintai anak anaknya dalam setiap keadaan bahkan ketika anaknya bersikap sangat menyakiti hatinya
3221234 aku memberinya kebijaksanaan untuk mengetahui bahwa seorang suami yang baik takkan pernah menyakiti isterinya tetapi kadang menguji kekuatannya dan ketetapan hatinya untuk berada di sisi suaminya tanpa ragu
3221235 dan akhirnya aku memberinya air mata untuk diteteskan ini adalah khusus miliknya untuk digunakan kapan pun ia butuhkan

3221238 we went there on an unofficial visit to see how he liked it and see how their academic plan is for him and their rehab since he had an acl surgery june 19 he didnt want something too big or too small assistant coach tony stubblefield has been recruiting him patiently since march weve had offers from other schools arizona ucla oklahoma kansas all the big guys
3221239 best case scenario would be september worst case scenario would be december
3221240 we just want to make sure the kids ready the doctors are saying dec 1 he should be healthy enough to start playing basketball were saying jan 1 right now his knee looks good
3221241 he has been at img since march and im sure img has been working with him on the english language
3221242 i am as curious as anyone else is to see how he does on the test i love the kid and you wish the kid the best and i hope it works out for him he is a super kid and was a role model on our campus but i really hope that img continued to educate him in the english language and math to get ready for that test when he left our campus in march i thought it would be difficult for him to pass the test
3221243 the ad asked him any if he had any questions
3221244 he said what is my academic plan second question whats the rehab like nothing about xs or os
3221245 theres a big difference between you and i being ready and being basketball ready bearcats head coach mick cronin said hes not going to throw him out there until hes 100 percent cleared by a doctor and hes basketball ready
3221246 hes not ready to step in and immediately make an impact on a team
3221247 however in my seven years of pre draft training i havent seen many better projects we had ricky sanchez down here who was drafted directly out of high school as well as weve had numerous kids who weve prepared for the draft including monta ellis louis williams and jackie butler all guys that were drafted and turned into pretty good players and john is a much better prospect than any of those guys were
3221248 if he gets in with the proper strength and conditioning program hes going to have a chance to be one of the better shot blockers and really impact the game from a standpoint of maybe getting to the level of a poor mans patrick ewing

3221312 if england is being pushed by a particular school i would consider that to be political activity which our schools should not be involved in i accept that for other people this is a minor issue but for me its an extremely major issue its all very well saying sport and politics shouldnt be linked but sport is so huge especially football they are linked if there is going to be a link with england it should be a political link and i dont see why that should take place in schools im in politics for one reason and that is to break up the uk and so any suggestion of a strengthening of a link between scotland and england is what im opposed to
3221313 im very glad that people from england and elsewhere are coming to visit work or study and in some cases stay i welcome them to glasgow not least because it shows they think the city is better than those in england

3221318 a line has been crossed when space raiders are no longer 10p
3221319 mp margaret curran has started her labour saving campaign in glasgow east by pinpointing the achilles heel of the snp its the personality of the nats candidate john mason
3221320 he is the colourless man in the shadows often sporting a bitter expression big smiley alex salmond is doing most of the talking so far so currans first move has been to challenge mason to a tv debate
3221321 her strength is debating big issues mason sweats the small stuff facing a feisty woman will be the last thing this man wants
3221322 he has failed to accept a woman in politics in the past i know because it was me it was mason who gave me my first taste of the small minded destructive side of scottish politics
3221323 margaret curran was my opponent in 1999 she won and i got in as a list msp this time around the snp is throwing big bucks into it but personality still counts
3221324 curran was not my problem she fought fair mason was my problem i could not comprehend how this quiet bachelor an accountant who is a professed christian could be so incredibly hostile even when i was at first a stranger to him
3221325 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3221326 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3221327 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3221328 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3221329 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3221330 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3221331 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3221360 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3221361 since real world exploitation requires bypassing multiple memory protections we will present several ways in which these techniques can be combined to achieve remote code execution
3221362 if you read the authors actual words not the sensationalist and wildly inaccurate news accounts you get a completely different story
3221363 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
3221364 the design and implementation of the memory protection mechanisms in windows have a number of limitations that reduce their effectiveness
3221365 in this paper we demonstrated that the memory protection mechanisms available in the latest versions of windows are not always effective when it comes to preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers they raise the bar but the attacker still has a good chance of being able to bypass them

3221385 and ill have to pray that he can cook and clean because you are a complete mess with both hopefully he will have a decent education with good grades and a consistent job get to know his family first we dont need any more drama

3221391 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
3221392 how did you get the job of third days road pastor

3221404 unitedfuture will introduce shared parenting as a default position for child custody arrangements in the family court
3221405 shared parenting is currently granted in only one in nine judgements by the family court with sole custody given to only one parent in eight out of ten cases which is an extremely unsatisfactory situation
3221406 shared parenting would mean that when both parents want custody there will be a presumption that day to day care will be shared unless there are good reasons why it should not be
3221407 academic studies as well as common sense tell us that children are better off when they continue to have significant relationships with both parents after parental separation
3221408 it is a disgrace that the government has not bothered to allow for dna testing to create certainty for families where currently none exists
3221409 the fact that these men are forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in child support for children they are not sure are even their own is a breach of natural justice
3221410 for the children it is a human rights issue they are entitled to know who their father is or in some cases is not
3221411 it is timely to reassess the formula to ensure that it is flexible enough to reflect the complexities of raising children when the parents are separated and both parents contribute to the care of their children
3221412 i have asked my policy officials to examine a number of options for updating the child support system to deal with these and related concerns
3221413 family law is failing thousands of families in new zealand and is long overdue for reform and the effect of fatherlessness is well known and a prime indicator for crime and antisocial behaviour
3221414 family law reform is well overdue in this country the effects of our current system cannot be underestimated and have wide ranging consequences
3221415 unitedfuture is the only party working to make sure children continue to enjoy the support and care of their entire family after parental separation and we are taking the necessary steps to achieve this

3221418 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
3221419 a tree is identified by its fruit make a tree good and its fruit will be good make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad
3221420 the test you know the test youve passed and i am pleased
3221421 was life giving me tests and obstacles to overcome to make me stronger mentally
3221422 you dont understand and it is you giving the test you see its you whos lost because you are pure thought with no heart and soul and that is what leads you astray i may have passed this test of yours but i was only searching for love and happiness in the first place yet youve deceived me for your own purpose now go away
3221423 thank you for pulling me out of that hole i dont need that ladder i already feel on top of the world
3221424 the court confirmed the commissions view that reducing monopoly profits through lower prices is an obvious and significant benefit to gas consumers
3221425 gas consumers have been receiving such benefits since october 2005 when the commission required powerco and vector to lower their average gas pipeline prices by nine percent and 9 5 percent respectively
3221426 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past
3221427 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3221428 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3221429 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3221430 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3221431 the end of credit card consumerism us news and world report
3221432 im going to play around with flavour combinations and cook what i want to eat
3221433 i think thats when i became really creative because i relaxed about it i wasnt trying
3221434 i let the other guys chefs do it and i just cooked some nice food and really it become the most energising period of my life
3221435 im having more fun now with my food than i have in a long long time
3221436 some of the recipes are aspirational some of them are really simple and its for anybody looking for a prompt as to what to do
3221437 im a firm advocate in new zealands reputation as a food destination we have to get smarter about it
3221438 we have a responsibility to become passionate about it about our dining experiences and get that message offshore so people come here to eat rather than us being the worlds pantry
3221439 i want to beat that drum a wee bit and if i can do that through writing i will
3221440 we should be telling those people get down here and eat this
3221441 its not just about white water rafting and bungy jumping or going for bush walks
3221442 there is some really cool food happening here and theres a great deal of integrity behind it because it has been cooked by chefs with a great deal of integrity
3221443 the big food companies would like you to think its too hard to cook
3221444 the confidence we enjoyed for centuries that we could cook has been eroded the whole package meal in the supermarket thing i could never make mine look like that so ill buy it
3221445 we lose the skill levels and we do have time
3221446 they hate us they want people out of restaurants and shopping for food
3221447 they say were time poor but i dont think we are
3221448 its about making that time its about embracing those values about having family and friends over and cooking and enjoying it
3221449 its a bit of mind over matter and something like chicken livers is still quite cheap
3221450 some of those cheaper cuts require longer cooking and again it feels like a catch 22 because you need to give it a bit of care and attention
3221451 people have put distance between you and i and our food it has been deliberately done to divorce that relationship
3221452 people have lost that connection to it because they dont know how they grow it
3221453 cooking is about an act of generosity its one of the greatest joys around and putting a plate in front of someone and watching them eat gives you tremendous satisfaction
3221454 the dinner the meal the love of food thats the occasion and thats what it should be about
3221455 using food and wine as the vehicle to create that occasion
3221456 i find if im stressed or blue ill go for food it helps me it sends me away to other places
3221457 i genuinely like food its not about fine dining all the time
3221458 it could be sardines on toast but i make sure theyre really good sardines
3221459 i tend to shy away from the baked beans on toast approach to things
3221460 once again be a guarantee of fraternity and peace between different peoples

3221464 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was
3221465 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3221466 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3221467 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3221468 i came into the olympics not really thinking id get a medal or anything i just wanted to make the final
3221469 theres a valuable bonus to that we get information about whats happening in the ocean and in particular whats happening in the ocean underneath the antarctic sea ice which is a part of the ocean thats very difficult for us to observe in any other way
3221470 the buoys that we use that profile up and down through the water column in the rest of the ocean need to reach the surface to transmit the data by satellite
3221471 so far the ocean underneath the sea ice is really the big blind spot in our observing system that we use to observe the global ocean
3221472 they measure temperature and salinity as a function of depth as they dive down and up through the water column and from that information we can determine what the ocean currents are doing
3221473 they provide us with a very detailed record of how temperatures and salinity has changed and from that information we can infer how much sea ice forms
3221474 sea ice forms and sea ice is very important for both climate and ecosystems in the southern ocean
3221475 if we want to understand whats going to happen to the climate in the future we need to know what the sea ice is going to do will there be more or less and will it form more or less rapidly
3221476 its like 3 times faster than the read this page
3221477 there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick

3221492 the inclusion of gaming in a library collection is not unexpected if you take some perspective libraries hit a turning point when they made the decision to start including popular media in their collections by doing so they shifted their collection development practices to be more inclusive of what their patrons want embracing the desires of the community they also opened the door to more non traditional resources and by continuing to develop a more inclusionary collection development policy libraries are laying the foundation for building a collection of ideas add to this the maturation of board games over the last twenty years and you can start to see the value that games hold as community resources they have grown into another avenue of creative expression that like a good book or song can capture and share ideas with those who invest the time

3221562 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3221563 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3221564 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3221565 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3221566 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3221567 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3221568 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3221569 it is collecting signatures for people that are letting congress know that they want support for legislative laws to fight cancer

3221573 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia

3221587 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3221588 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3221589 2 3 billion people in the world claim to be followers of jesus
3221590 the old paradigm was you pay you pray you get out of the way
3221591 theres a church in every village in the world the potential sits there like a sleeping giant
3221592 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3221593 im so tired of christians being known for what theyre against
3221594 one of my goals is to take evangelicals back a century to the 19th century
3221595 that was a time of muscular christianity that cared about every aspect of life
3221596 im worried that evangelicals be identified too much with one party or the other when that happens you lose your prophetic role of speaking truth to power
3221597 and you have to defend stupid things that leaders do
3221598 politics is always downstream from culture i place less confidence in it than a lot of folks i dont think thats the answer politics is not the right tool to change the culture
3221599 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3221600 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3221601 the protests have to be resolved before we disburse the money
3221602 when we sell a parcel with a notice that it is protested and later there is a ruling in favor of the protest then the blm needs to return the money to the buyer
3221603 so obviously we dont want to disburse the funds on a protested parcel and then ask the state to give back the money which would be awkward
3221604 valuable to the state and federal government whenever they come
3221605 a company looks at that and says the question is when will i see the permits to drill could i guarantee i will be able to get my investment recovered and some companies might conclude they are not sure
3221606 the discovery of liquid water on mars combined with earlier discoveries of organic substances in a meteorite that came from mars and also of methane in the martian atmosphere all point to the existence of life contemporary life on the red planet

3221617 no es que hay que quitarle la ilusi n a la gente sino tampoco a los propios jugadores si no la tienen se las ten s que dar por qu no podemos so ar con aspirar a cosas importantes hay futbolistas con cinco o seis torneos en el lomo y con chicos con un futuro maravilloso hay que ser conscientes de eso qui n nos va a quitar esa ilusi n hay que luchar por eso lo m nimo que debemos hacer es permitirse so ar y tratar de estar arriba primero para los jugadores y despu s para los hinchas

3221619 fue positivo por el trabajo que se hizo sigo sosteniendo lo mismo tuvimos tres d as de trabajo y sab amos que deb amos apelar al coraje y al coraz n del equipo y dejar claro una idea futbol stica por lo menos en la recuperaci n qued agradecido porque los muchachos no se guardaron nada el terminar con una victoria en el arranque ante un rival como gimnasia que volv a al bosque y que est necesitado es altamente destacable mi presentaci n queda como una an cdota lo que valoro es el esfuerzo que hicieron y el compromiso que tuvieron

3221699 opportunities to meet directly with landowners educate them about certification and walk them through enrollment in the group process are critical to our ability to increase the number of fsc certified acres here in the northeast
3221700 by enabling us to increase the trusts capacity the verso grant will allow us to significantly increase those opportunities
3221701 the program has traditionally enrolled family forestlands ranging up to about 2 500 acres
3221702 in addition to those smaller forests were encouraging the tcnf to certify larger parcels under the group umbrella
3221703 well be working closely with the wood procurement professionals at verso and other paper and forest products companies to help identify landowners who might want to enroll in the fsc group certification program
3221704 of course interested landowners can contact the trust directly by calling 207 688 8195

3221856 trip was shrouded in secrecy because of security concerns and revealed only when he had headed home
3221857 ties between the two neighboring countries had been strained since the fall of saddam because of jordanian fears that iraqs shiite led government was too friendly with shiite dominated iran jordanian officials have been concerned about iranian influence in iraq and the loss of discounted oil which saddam once provided

3221876 there was confusion as to the extent of the attacks however with at least two independent internet monitoring companies saying they had seen no evidence of large scale attacks on georgian government infrastructure
3221877 two web monitoring companies contacted by the times said however that they had not seen evidence of any significant attack on georgian government infrastructure of the sort that affected estonias computer systems in may last year
3221878 far from the battlefield at their computers in moscow another type of soldier was fighting the enemy in the early hours of saturday news websites registered on georgian servers either stopped working or presented false information although no one was caught red handed there was no doubt that the operation was orchestrated by the kremlin
3221879 georgia too has experimented with cyber warfare on august 5 three days before the military operation in south ossetia the secessionist republics two news online services were reportedly hacked this time both websites started to feature the logo and material of a rival company financed by the georgian government
3221880 the front page of the website of russian backed news agency osinform osinform ru which is run by the breakaway regions state radio and television station ir retained the agencys header and logo but otherwize the entire page was featuring alania tvs website content including its news and images

3221888 i came home in 1958 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3221889 students were not taken seriously here before the civil rights movement and private money receded at the mention of a communist youth festival
3221890 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival
3221891 i was never asked to report on other americans or assess foreign nationals i had met
3221892 the c i a s big mistake was not supplanting itself with private funds fast enough

3221922 before i go on with this short history let me make a general observation the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise

3221934 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3221935 russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values as such the fate of georgia should be of grave concern to americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of europe and the independence of former soviet republics
3221936 the international response to this crisis will determine how russia manages its relationships with other neighbors we have other important strategic interests at stake in georgia especially the continued flow of oil through the baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline which russia attempted to bomb in recent days the operation of a critical communication and trade route from georgia through azerbaijan and central asia and the integrity and influence of nato whose members reaffirmed last april the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia
3221937 there is a relatively new situation going on at both companies dc has a rather different method of planning stories in that tons of people cram into a room and plot out the direction of a title or character for a year or three marvel tended to be a little more free wheeling but lately they have adopted more of the meeting syndrome as well to mixed results the one big change to all of this recently is that both companies are trying their hand at crafting an in depth meta story involving the entirety of their respective shared universes but the results are not going well
3221938 with both of these writers morrison and bendis we have a case of someone getting stuck on an idea and getting away with writing a few things and then waiting biding their time until they could get enough influence over enough titles to carry out the rest of their plan we are dealing with two large stories that are consuming more than their fair share of shared universe comic pages not quite as much at dc to play out an old old idea by a tired writer who keeps his ideas in the back of his head waiting for the chance to plug them in wherever he can make them fit
3221939 while crafting a meta story is not in itself a bad idea it is hard to do in cinematic style

3221996 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3221997 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3221998 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3221999 hoje se assinalam exactamente 7 anos que siba siba foi brutalmente assassinado
3222000 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3222001 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3222002 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3222003 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3222004 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3222012 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3222013 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3222014 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3222015 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3222016 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3222017 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3222018 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3222053 on august 9th i spoke with a friend in the television industry and he said that the live broadcast of the opening ceremony was the responsibility of beijing olympic broadcasting bob the bob live broadcast was global and many television stations around the world including tvb all used the bob broadcast which was excellent but cctv held broadcasting rights in china and brought their own cameras and director so the final broadcast in china included clips from both cctv coverage and bob coverage cut and broadcast simultaneously ruining the overall effect the odd collection of closeups on famous people and actors and leaders and the shaky video footage was all thanks to cctv

3222155 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3222156 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3222157 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3222158 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3222159 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3222160 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3222161 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3222162 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3222163 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3222164 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3222165 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3222166 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3222167 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3222168 the deteriorating economic condition is putting new stress on europe which seems to be even weaker now than the u s
3222169 some pessimists even talk now about the euro area breaking apart i would not go that far but we do know the honeymoon is over and this is the first real test of the marriage that we have seen
3222170 every two to three weeks the prices are going up we are buying less just like everybody else
3222171 we know this isnt going to be easy to bounce back from
3222172 our problem is that we adopted an american model of growth looking to services and construction and quick returns
3222173 it made us more like the united states and less like germany now we see that was a huge mistake
3222174 it shows that pagans who were a minority prayed in the center of the city and lived in harmony with the jewish majority
3222175 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3222176 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3222177 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3222178 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3222179 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3222180 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3222181 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3222182 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3222183 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3222184 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3222185 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3222186 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3222187 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3222188 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3222189 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3222190 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3222191 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3222192 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3222193 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3222194 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3222195 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3222196 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3222197 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3222198 i asked the mauritanian officials for a meeting with the former president but they rejected my demand but they assured me that he is in a good health and in a good living conditions
3222199 he was probably going to be a redshirt guy for us defensively
3222200 but we think he might be in a position to help us this year from an offensive line standpoint
3222201 but well have him back by the middle of the week the latest
3222202 he came up to me today after our first practice
3222203 he said he wanted to get on the field in any way possible all he wants to do is give back to the team

3222215 i always wanted a sister nobody ever taught me girl stuff i had to have a friend come over and tell me when to shave my legs
3222216 the way students and scholars interpret the materials they work with in their academic fields is more a matter of personality than of training different interpretations come about when people with different personalities look at exactly the same objects facts data or events and see different things
3222217 yeah theyre doing slow moves so it cant be that hard

3222220 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3222221 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3222222 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3222223 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3222224 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3222225 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3222226 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3222227 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3222228 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3222229 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3222230 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3222231 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3222232 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3222233 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one

3222237 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3222238 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3222239 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3222240 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3222241 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3222242 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3222244 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3222245 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3222246 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3222247 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

3222250 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3222251 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3222252 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3222253 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3222254 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3222255 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3222256 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3222257 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3222258 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3222259 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3222260 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3222261 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3222262 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3222263 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3222264 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3222265 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3222266 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3222267 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3222268 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3222269 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3222270 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3222271 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3222272 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3222273 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3222274 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3222275 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3222276 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3222277 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3222278 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3222279 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3222280 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3222281 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3222282 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3222283 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3222284 obamas campaign has hit a soft patch this summer with november just three months off it still appears an obama outcome in massachusetts is not in question but the margin certainly is
3222285 in presidential politics color new york state blue and throw away the crayons
3222286 oklahomans have their minds made up and they arent going to change come hell or high water no matter what
3222287 alaskans for obama a rare democratic push on the last frontier
3222288 obama and mccain are doing equally well in raiding the other partys base ten percent of 2004 kerry voters favor mccain while 13 percent of 2004 bush backers are with obama in order to close the gap mccain needs to do a little bit better winning back the democrats who voted for ronald reagan and their children
3222289 it would take an exceptional turnout from young voters and black voters as well as a lot of disaffected conservatives voting for bob barr
3222290 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3222291 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3222292 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3222293 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3222294 what is there to appreciate you are either gripped by a real story or you are not what the f amp is wrong with you
3222295 well how do you know that the owner of the b and b wont just keep the cash for herself
3222296 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3222297 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3222298 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3222299 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3222300 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3222301 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3222302 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3222303 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3222304 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3222305 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3222306 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3222307 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3222308 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3222309 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3222310 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3222311 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3222312 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3222313 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3222314 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3222315 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3222316 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3222317 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3222318 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3222319 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3222320 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3222321 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3222322 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3222323 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3222324 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3222325 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3222326 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3222327 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3222328 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3222329 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3222330 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3222331 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3222332 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3222333 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3222334 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3222335 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3222336 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3222337 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3222338 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3222339 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3222340 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3222341 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3222342 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3222343 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3222344 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3222345 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3222346 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3222347 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3222348 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3222349 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3222350 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3222351 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3222352 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3222353 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3222354 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3222355 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3222356 a city where walking is the most dangerous form of transportation over the last five years getting his buzz on
3222357 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3222358 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3222359 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3222360 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3222361 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3222362 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3222363 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3222364 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3222365 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3222366 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3222367 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3222368 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3222369 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3222370 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3222371 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3222372 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3222373 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3222374 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3222375 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3222376 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3222377 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3222378 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3222379 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3222380 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3222381 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3222382 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3222383 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3222384 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3222385 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3222386 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3222387 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3222388 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
3222389 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
3222390 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
3222391 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
3222392 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
3222393 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
3222394 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3222395 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
3222396 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
3222397 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
3222398 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
3222399 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
3222400 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
3222401 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
3222402 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
3222403 mostly black and with japanese tomboy airs a range of tailored jackets many deconstructed along with cropped pants baggy shorts and a variety of skirts in stretch wool
3222404 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3222405 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3222406 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3222407 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3222408 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3222409 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3222410 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3222411 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3222412 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3222413 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3222414 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3222415 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3222416 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3222417 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3222418 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3222419 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3222420 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3222421 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3222422 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3222423 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3222424 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3222425 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3222426 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3222427 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3222428 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3222429 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3222430 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3222431 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3222432 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3222433 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3222434 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3222435 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3222436 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3222437 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3222438 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3222439 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3222440 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3222441 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3222442 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3222443 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3222444 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3222445 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3222446 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3222447 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3222448 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3222449 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3222450 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3222451 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3222452 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3222453 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3222454 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3222455 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3222456 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3222457 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3222458 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3222459 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3222460 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3222461 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3222462 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3222463 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3222464 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3222465 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3222466 just so you all know we did set a record
3222467 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3222468 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3222469 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3222470 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3222471 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3222472 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3222473 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3222474 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3222475 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3222476 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3222477 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3222478 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3222479 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3222480 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3222481 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3222482 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3222483 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3222484 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3222485 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3222486 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3222487 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3222488 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3222489 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3222490 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3222491 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3222492 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3222493 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3222494 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3222495 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3222496 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3222497 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3222498 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3222499 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3222500 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3222501 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3222502 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3222503 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3222504 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3222505 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3222506 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3222507 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3222508 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3222509 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3222510 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3222511 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3222512 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3222513 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3222514 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3222515 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3222516 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3222517 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3222518 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3222519 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3222520 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3222521 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3222522 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3222523 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3222524 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3222525 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3222526 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3222527 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3222528 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3222529 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3222530 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3222531 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3222532 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3222533 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3222534 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3222535 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3222536 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3222537 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3222538 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3222539 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3222540 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3222541 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3222542 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3222543 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3222544 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3222545 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3222546 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3222547 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3222548 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3222549 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3222550 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3222551 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3222552 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3222553 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3222554 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3222555 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3222556 on the regions biodiversity and on river bank communities including indigenous tribes living close to the reservoir area
3222557 what a great day for indian cricket what a great day for the indian nation
3222558 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3222559 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3222560 a lot of the commodity funds seem to be unwinding positions and us us dollars are getting bought at the same time as they are selling aussie
3222561 thats not provided a positive read for the economy that may have added an additional part of selling

3222564 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3222565 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3222566 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3222567 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3222568 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3222569 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3222570 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3222571 si no nos despistamos podemos obtener medalla pero siempre yendo partido a partido
3222572 ha sido una irresponsabidad aplicaremos con toda la dureza la ley antidopaje
3222573 god loved abraham and said to him go forth out of the house of thy father into the land to which i shall guide thee
3222574 when isaac was grown up abraham having lived one hundred and seventy years died and was buried
3222575 jacob went to egypt when he was one hundred and thirty years old accompanied by his kin to the number of sixty five souls
3222576 at this moment thermuthi the daughter of pharaoh went down to bathe and on seeing the child floating there she rescued him and named him moses and brough him up
3222577 when moses grew to manhood he was great in the house of pharaoh
3222578 set israel free that they may perform sacrifice to god for three days
3222579 when moses came before pharaoh the king did not heed him
3222580 the lord lead them over the road through the desert to the red sea preceding them by night as a fiery pillar and by day as a cloud
3222581 god loved israel and they traveled three days from the sea and arrived at marah
3222582 yet again they murmured again moses and aaron because there was no water and the lord said to moses smite the rock with thy rod
3222583 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
3222584 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
3222585 then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory
3222586 thats great i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3222587 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me i knew park would have a strong last 50 metres so i had to keep my focus and concentration

3222592 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3222593 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3222594 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3222595 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3222596 a war is underway and our colleagues need to listen before consulting with their capitals and making decisions they need to listen to each party
3222597 thats great i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3222598 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me i knew park would have a strong last 50 metres so i had to keep my focus and concentration
3222599 were keeping our options open with what we do with the volt on a worldwide basis
3222600 our immediate focus is to get this car developed and get it in the market in the united states
3222601 it would be something that would be readily accepted by a lot of people here
3222602 cannot build the cars any faster than right now in the united states
3222603 ive known chris for years and weve looked for projects in the past that never quite happened stratford has been kind of his home base he grew up here and this is where he really formed his craft no one knows this stage better than christopher plummer so when he said he wanted to do this play i wanted to step up and direct it
3222604 does pay for voluntary circumcisions according to managed care rules
3222605 manage the hospital supplies and other costs by ensuring the rational utilisation of benefits
3222606 is encouraged at the emerging scientific evidence of the role that circumcision could potentially play in preventing future hiv infection in men as well as growing evidence relating to prevention of penile cancers
3222607 we believe in evidence based decision making in terms of our healthcare funding decisions and will therefore continue to monitor research in this regard
3222608 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation but the victim also declined medical treatment
3222609 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges anytime there is a domestic allegation the victim is offered an emergency protection order basically a restraining order she declined it
3222610 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off
3222611 i am excited about it in some way every show that followed 90210 was a remake of 90210 for the fans sake i am really happy for them
3222612 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
3222613 i began to see the most clearly i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional
3222614 i had been so unhappy and i realised that i had just been literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly
3222615 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks
3222616 he walks through the whole barracks and gets to the end of the barracks and theres john malkovich and joe pantoliano and me its a six minute shot and then i screwed up my line
3222617 i said oh whoops sorry maybe we should cut steven spielberg is in another building watching on the monitors and i just hear silence then i hear him what happened
3222618 im like i just yelled cut because i screwed up and hes yelling no no you never cut i literally turned white and shrunk because my hero and idol steven spielberg is yelling at me
3222619 i learned you never yell cut as an actor the director yells cut for years i lived with this shame but weve laughed about it since because he remembers it too i was mortified
3222620 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes you think its gonna be a fun video game but real centipedes if they bite you its like getting shot with a bullet its that painful
3222621 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3222622 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop
3222623 i bruised my rib and you know how that goes if you get a rib bruise it lasts for about six weeks of not being able to breathe all the way in its such a drag
3222624 their repressed muslim government hates the fact that i am an actress but they still all see my movies even though my films are not allowed to be shown there
3222625 but everythings under the table everyone sells on the black market they get pirated copies and then someone copies the copies
3222626 stranger things have happened you know that stuff does happen right so i dont know well see what happens i have a wonderful wife who is very capable and who knows maybe well have a surprise
3222627 look at prince william and harry im always reading about prince harry hes getting drunk hes kissing girls hes falling out of nightclubs at five oclock in the morning
3222628 well so hes doing the same thing as every other 22 or 23 year old out there but he cant because hes not a normal human being hes a demi god because hes a royal
3222629 cancer is scary and lonely you cant ask anyone to make decisions for you because its just too heavy
3222630 there is a lot of rush to treatment when what you really need is time to research and think about how you want to approach this take your time christina there is no rush take your time and think it through
3222631 i would love to design one day i do not have the time right now but i would love to develop a home line or a clothing line so we will see what comes first
3222632 my definition of style is comfort i have to be comfortable so that would most likely the line i would take
3222633 somebody asked me one time what my sexual fantasy would be and under the guise of sounding crazy i said it would be having sex in a car but that seemed kind of conservative to me afterwards
3222634 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife
3222635 ive heard this rumour a couple of days ago somebody asked me that and that was the first id heard about it its incredibly flattering to be in a rumour i would do it in a second with those guys but do you think its a good idea to redo ghostbusters its a classic
3222636 raising them here is different because i was raised in new york city its totally different i grew up in the upper west side of manhattan in the 70s
3222637 there were fires and riots and serial killers it was great my kids its l a its sunny and nice they dont have any excitement
3222638 a really naive simple guy who doesnt know the first thing about jihad and was just tagging along for the job
3222639 i have not decided on a candidate i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3222640 he told us im just one of you guys tonight
3222641 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation but the victim also declined medical treatment
3222642 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges anytime there is a domestic allegation the victim is offered an emergency protection order basically a restraining order she declined it
3222643 we were 40 hours into this and now the doctors are getting concerned about the water being broken and the possibility of infection
3222644 i wouldnt say shes alves suffering but shes having to dig deep shes tired shes exhausted shes in pain when the contractions come youve gotta push and in between them those 30 second intervals shes passing out and then coming back to and that went on for hours
3222645 and we had this problem upon contractions the babys pulse would sink it was getting down to 70 which means the umbilical cord is somewhere strapped across the oesophagus
3222646 the doctor called c section and as soon as they say c section 33 minutes later the babys out i was like 60 hours weve been in here and if wed have come in and just said lets just have it you could do it in three hours
3222647 it went down perfectly even though we went 60 hours to do what could have been done in a few hours it was a great journey for both of us
3222648 i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get many things that are so smart
3222649 the dark knight is like a ferrari engine of storytelling and scriptwriting and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
3222650 i didnt understand the dark knight i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy
3222651 im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
3222652 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many
3222653 he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless god bless and blessed isaac hayes
3222654 gentlemen of the world please disband the practice those of you who dont get regular check ups sic
3222655 its far better to know sooner than later because later many times is too late if you take care of self self will take care of you most of the way
3222656 i was warned our meeting wouldnt take long but i thought that would mean 30 minutes
3222657 instead he spoke to me for just 40 seconds it was the shortest meeting ive ever had with a director
3222658 its just sensible what are you doing to do fight back and get knifed
3222659 its probably something that many men do not admit i dont mind saying that its happened so many times and i always feel scared
3222660 my problem isnt more important than anyone elses just because im an actor and im also not afraid to say that it is more of a problem in latin america
3222661 julia was trying to get out of the way of the picture she wasnt being sarcastic
3222662 he was a lovely man but i was very young i didnt know who i was and i was still struggling as an actor i was a terrible wife
3222663 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3222664 that will be the start of a nationwide protest we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3222665 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3222666 she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3222667 but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3222668 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3222669 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3222670 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more when i first arrived in london i was much more afraid of that so i stayed in
3222671 but after a while i began to feel claustrophobic and thought we have to get out
3222672 you dont think there are some deluded americans hey how about all of us
3222673 everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that just like kim
3222674 in america you have the people who watch the lohans reality show and want to be like dina and ali lohan and live in a house with a throne in it everywhere theyre just everywhere
3222675 she eva asked victoria to come on board and help
3222676 victoria was thrilled and talked it through with her husband david but he thought she was spreading herself a bit thin and should concentrate on what she was good at running a successful fashion line and looking after the family
3222677 it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs
3222678 its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
3222679 im not friends with amy winehouse i dont live in camden ive never smoked crack ive had experiences with drugs some good some bad and its not something i want to pursue i can say now ive never overdosed
3222680 today and tomorrow will never be as funny as yesterday without bernie mac a true original
3222681 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3222682 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3222683 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out he had sarcoidosis lung disease but it was in remission
3222684 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3222685 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital he was in intensive care the whole time
3222686 im enjoying myself but im not great with women dude im not a closer i can chat all night long but im not the guy who goes okay back to my room
3222687 ive never been that way its not my presence i just cant do it but its not been a priority of mine for a while
3222688 i danced one night in a place there was a club and they asked for a guy to kind of make a striptease and i did it it was for ten minutes i needed money
3222689 my mother was there in the audience she was so proud
3222690 i did one other cameo in the pilot first episode but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
3222691 two sweaters a pool cue a few cds and a pocketknife from the estate of one of televisions best known faces a man who happened incidentally to be my father
3222692 having to leave my fathers deathbed so that some guy with an ice box could shuck his eyes out while they were fresh still makes me sick and furious to this day
3222693 i was in shock when i received the letter i stood there in my kitchen having four pages of this vomit being thrown at me by someone i thought i had a relationship with i dont hate chris but i dont understand why hes doing this everything he says is untrue
3222694 jerry always said he was so proud that at age 69 he didnt need glasses he said if i can give anything back i want to give my eyes i cant give my liver because i drank too much and i cant give my lungs because i smoked too much but i can give my eyes
3222695 so on his deathbed when they asked if he was an organ donor i said take his eyes chris knew nothing of this he knew nothing of what his father and i discussed for 25 years
3222696 its a very melodramatic gesture but i no longer saw the sense in maintaining a relationship with elaine
3222697 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda
3222698 the doctors were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3222699 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
3222700 more public and private investment is needed to speed up digitization
3222701 is it going to be different yes is it going to be dramatically different no its still going to be scores and highlights
3222702 we only had one or two days where we actually did try to pull off a three hour rehearsal
3222703 the beauty is that we have a whole crew of people in place
3222704 we think there is more upside to the 9 a m start
3222705 problematic to try to merge the two companies in the current regulatory environment
3222706 in addition to strong management skills and proven experience in the industry joanne brings a unique understanding of the company to this position
3222707 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3222708 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3222709 this is a digitally manufactured shot to represent whats happening right now outside the stadium
3222710 the audience makeup of the olympics is very much like that of american idol and dancing with the stars which have live season finales presented in much the same way
3222711 you assume theres a large amount of intelligence in the viewing audience so when they see those twice an hour time stamps theyll understand what is being presented
3222712 an individual company or organization that has made a substantial impact and demonstrated extraordinary use of television
3222713 we salute this eye opening campaign which really addresses the problems that our world is facing today
3222714 the campaign was informative moving and deserving of this honor
3222715 as the climate crisis becomes more urgent ngc has been strongly committed to providing actionable information for those who wants to make a change and it is especially meaningful to have those efforts recognized
3222716 special olympics is launching an r word campaign to seek remove of the use of the word from mainstream language and popular culture
3222717 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3222718 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3222719 we have seen no evidence that digital cannibalizes any of our packaged media businesses in fact in some cases it might stimulate the appetite for this
3222720 with the ebbs and flows of the pride picture fund coupled with a heavily back loaded year affecting both free cash flow and ebitida we are not anticipating free cash flow to grow this fiscal year
3222721 tve has to position a news channel a sports channel a culture channel and we have to do it as soon as possible because this is a two year project we have to give it something extra with a strong presenter
3222722 capra esque but with a modern and very contemporary spin on the fun and the comedy
3222723 i was going to direct it and jack nicholson was going to play the pro who was a wizard who brings a boy into the golf world
3222724 the climate has changed in that theres very few slots for dramas or for the things that i wanted to do
3222725 and i didnt want to do another cop show though i would consider something if it were international in scope and global in nature
3222726 i dont know how long well be able to sustain the gross
3222727 in the fall i do think well have a lot of interest but weve already taken so much out of the marketplace well cross the 500 million bridge around labor day and see where it goes from there
3222728 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3222729 you put all of the numbers together and say this is great
3222730 its a good question but we need to let the picture play out a little more
3222731 it was the biggest tv event ever so everybody was down friday night uniformly
3222732 a lot of our domestic drug policy has reached a level of absurdity so a comedy pill makes it all easier to swallow
3222733 its an action ensemble comedy in the vein of oceans eleven where the casting becomes an event
3222734 it is a bunch of these terrific actors getting together and having a good time its that kind of thing
3222735 at that time cg was nowhere in the special effects business
3222736 it enabled many movies to be made so it was a tremendously important development
3222737 in order to fit into live action we needed to solve the problem of motion blur the streaking of a moving object
3222738 also we need a mechanism for the artist to be able to control the look and the lighting
3222739 then we made a decision which proved to be an important one we decided that while we were leaders in animation we were working on toy story at the time we were going to sell a commercial product and we would let the studios drive the direction of where renderman went
3222740 by letting ilm digital domain and other studios have input we had this incredible breadth of really high end artistically demanding people who were requiring more and more complex images
3222741 terminator 2 made a lot of money and used renderman
3222742 that got a lot of people moving down the road of using renderman and computer graphics in making films
3222743 two years later jurassic park came out that was a huge film whatever resistance there was to this new direction essentially changed when that movie came out it was like a huge awakening in the industry effects were moving into a new era the era of computer graphics
3222744 what was so great about jurassic park was that the dinosaurs had motion blur so they looked natural if you compare jurassic park with the earlier dinosaur stop motion movies where the dinosaurs would judder around when they were moving quickly that lost the sense of reality
3222745 renderman was something you could do rendering with that was programmable
3222746 being able to drive a nice car without worrying about how to build the engine we could just focus on the look that we wanted to get and not worry so much what was going on internally in the engine that was pretty breakthrough at the time
3222747 as the things that weve been trying to do have become more complicated pixar has just been there with us trying to make sure those things are achievable

3222761 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3222762 russias actions have substantially damaged its reputation in the world
3222763 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3222764 theres really nothing that george w bush can or would or should do
3222765 this is no time for the united states to step up to the plate in any meaningful way unilaterally because what seems to be happening here once you sort through all the rhetoric is this is sort of the cold war coming back
3222766 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3222767 it is not easy for an indian to win an olympic medal let alone a gold because there is no sporting culture in our country i hope this will make sports a way of life in india
3222768 i sincerely hope this win will change the face of olympic sport in india
3222769 in our country olympic sports are not really a priority i hope now they will get more attention

3222792 it is for the first time after november 2005 that the passenger car segment has registered a decline that is largely due to cost of finance and its availability
3222793 the euphoria around excise duty reduction that had helped maintain the growth momentum in the first quarter has waned high interest rates high inflation and increase in car prices have lowered the buying power of a large section of people and the impact is now becoming visible
3222794 monsoons are generally lean period for passenger cars especially in areas with heavy rain as people tend to postpone their purchase this july has been worst because of an increase in car prices and the on going hike in interest rates

3222806 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3222807 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3222808 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3222809 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question
3222810 yes lets see a side by side comparison asap im a life long journalist and everything i write is 100 percent from my brain or attributed this piece i wrote while doing 200 or so interview s for the techcrunch50 event

3222829 we went to haiti to help there is so much poverty there we like to joke that there were no souvenirs so we adopted three children
3222830 when he first arrived at age 3 he couldnt believe that he would have his own bed
3222831 gods littlest angels is phenomenal they helped us through it all they are so dedicated and there is such a need for that
3222832 we do this because the haitian children will die if we dont take care of them
3222833 they have a very sweet flavor and can be eaten raw
3222834 they dont bleed like red ones when they are cooked
3222835 i like to keep a supply of beet caviar in the refrigerator especially during the summer
3222836 they are great to eat steamed with salt and pepper
3222837 i had a lady tell me about how she dried the beet tops in the oven and made chips she drizzled them with olive oil and sprinkled on some salt then spread them out on cookie sheets to dry in a 300 degree oven
3222838 for instance when my wife makes lasagna she uses the spanish roja i can smell it two houses away it has such a bold aroma and the flavor is great i like to use the inchelium in fresh salsa since it has a very mild flavor the georgian fire is moderate to hot flavored and good for general cooking uses
3222839 the garlic that is sold in the store is from china
3222840 it doesnt have the long shelf life of garlic that is grown locally it will go bad in a couple of months garlic from colorado fields will last a year
3222841 the music pink has a milder flavor and is delicious roasted
3222842 purple glazer is spicier and i like to use it in salsa the german variety is a lot like the music pink
3222843 this black kale has a flatter softer leaf its more tender to eat and easier to clean
3222844 all kales have ropy stems that run down the center of each leaf
3222845 theyre too tough to eat so just strip the leaves from the stems by sliding a sharp knife along the stem and letting the leaves fall away
3222846 i like to use it in potato salad for an amazing zip to the flavor
3222847 i call them magic beans because when they are cooking they turn green just like regular green beans

3222849 if it wasnt for jay lee we wouldnt have all this
3222850 we were sitting around lamenting the long summers because we wanted to carve powder
3222851 we really designed it to mimic the feeling of carving on a snowboard and thats what it did
3222852 it was awesome man we were living in san francisco at the time and we rocked that whole town on those things
3222853 the company was bought and a lot of money was sunk into it people really thought it was going to boom but it didnt
3222854 whenever you saw a mountainboard in an ad it was always something really gnarly
3222855 at the beginning we said within 10 years we wanted 10 percent of snowboarders to own a mountainboard
3222856 an organic grass roots type of ridership kids getting their friends into it its the young guys who are really driving the sport

3222868 this is a bill that john mccain called too generous but barack obama was an early supporter of
3222869 our discovery of this new signaling pathway adds to fundamental information about how cells work together during the remodeling of tissues and organs
3222870 this finding also may provide clues about the basic mechanisms of inflammation and wound healing in vertebrates
3222871 although mmp enzymes have been linked to disease progression their normal function is to help in tissue growth and wound healing
3222872 mmp research eventually could lead to therapeutics for a range of illnesses including cancer and arthritis
3222873 we have also started identifying the genes resistant to the red rot and pests from indigenous sugarcane species particularly from the wild in collaboration with the new delhi based national research for plant biotechnology nrpb
3222874 red rot is a major fungal disease and we used anti fungal genes drawn from other plant sources such as alfalfa plant for glucanase and paddy plant for chitenase and dahlia flowers for anti microbial peptides for developing the transgenic varieties
3222875 trials have actually indicated we are getting 20 per cent more fruit better juice better skin colour and on blind trials in wine tasting two years out of three weve had better wines
3222876 we not only eradicated all the viruses we eradicated the pytoplasma and the agrobacteria as well so the tissue culture that is coming out of our labs is perfectly clean

3222894 in addition to the mn forestry association and all the partners who helped we need to especially thank senator tom bakk and representative larry hosch for sponsoring legislation that led to establishing the 2c managed forest law the departments of revenue and natural resources were also very cooperative in drawing up the application and final rules to allow landowners easy access to the program

3222908 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3222909 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the l a galaxy much success in the future i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football

3222918 he came up big with the post route that he dove and caught and later on he turned that crossing route into a touchdown those are all positive signs he played very well that was encouraging
3222919 it felt good because i havent played in a whole year
3222920 everybody kept saying keep working hard keep fighting and your time will come i had a few big plays
3222921 he tries to keep us humble so we wont get too arrogant or too cocky i respect him for that because at that moment i could have gotten real arrogant and real cocky its better just to stay humble and keep working
3222922 hes further along with an understanding of what were doing
3222923 robert has some a long way from last year as a rookie

3222928 it really only matters if youre going to sell the securities
3222929 a critical factor in this current depressed mortgage related securities market is liquidity
3222930 i visited tallgrass creek when i first joined erickson its amazing the vitality and vibrancy of their residents seniors are out there on the web seeking information we are striving to change the vision of the place that you go to at retirement age and to change the notion that its the beginning of the end
3222931 what were doing is working and its what the guest obviously is looking for whether its dealing the cards or the meals or the correct marketing or the bathrooms being clean
3222932 were going to continue monitoring what our competitors are doing
3222933 at the end of the day we have to answer to our customers our employees and our owners
3222934 the country is probably going through the most severe credit crunch since 1991 92
3222935 i think bank credit is going to remain tight for a while
3222936 a lot of my corporate clients are not politically correct
3222937 wed talk about this stuff and laugh about it they said you should really write this down i did and it just took on a life of its own
3222938 political correctness has just taken all the fun out of everything
3222939 its ok to use all these terms like mammy that youre not supposed to use
3222940 cheesy museums a prison museum in georgia with a real electric chair
3222941 but you shouldnt be treated like a criminal if you do
3222942 where you can smoke like a chimney and really get drunk cheap
3222943 there are a few chapters that are down and dirty and are not appropriate for kids
3222944 the university owed no duty to warn the wellhausens son who was a tenant in a university dormitory of the open and obvious danger that would result from crawling out of the narrow window opening of his seventh floor dormitory room and attempting to drop down to a 2 foot wide concrete ledge several feet below the window 45 to 50 feet above the ground
3222945 further we can find no obligation on the part of the university to protect students from their own reckless and negligent acts
3222946 under the facts of this case we conclude that while the university like any landlord had a duty to act reasonably to protect the safety of its student tenants it did not have an affirmative duty to protect eric wellhausen from acting irresponsibly
3222947 eric knew or should have known of the danger presented by his actions accordingly the district court did not err in finding the wellhausens claim was barred by the discretionary function exception
3222948 the fact of the matter is that the university knows kids are going to do these things
3222949 so we ought to have the opportunity to ask a jury to make a determination of whether in that circumstance the university should do something
3222950 we are excited to continue releasing the finest in mobile content taking advantage of the unique capabilities of our partners like apple
3222951 i love that i can control the game holding and turning my iphone just like a steering wheel which really shows off how well the devices accelerometer works
3222952 while deegies is pumped up noisy and fun soho 119 is sexy languid sophisticated
3222953 its also a lifestyle store where you come in and outfit all the events of your life youll see items from designers everyone knows but some things that are not in the mainstream
3222954 what nbc is doing is saying lets see whos watching and what are they watching and then share that with advertisers
3222955 right now its more of an experimental thing but then going forward something they can use to sell
3222956 it protects our affiliates our advertisers and shows it to the largest number of viewers possible
3222957 the olympics attract people with a wide variety of interests which is a good opportunity for advertisers
3222958 i was talking to some people the other day and someone said who doesnt like the olympics and that would include advertisers
3222959 for example the best thing with windows is to try to replace with more energy efficient products
3222960 well be replacing the windows but they also must not look like theyre new
3222961 the acquisition of us salt accomplishes a lot for our investors on several fronts
3222962 the decrease in gross profit is directly related to increases in durum commodities and transportation costs that were not offset by higher selling prices
3222963 when i looked at the third quarter i was sort of disappointed
3222964 whats more reflective of american italian going forward second quarter numbers or third quarter numbers
3222965 the industry has been incredibly competitive so you have to wonder are they back to shooting themselves in the foot
3222966 theres a growing realization that top talent is the one true competitive edge that a company has
3222967 even when one of our clients business is slow another may be improving
3222968 we are trying to position kansas systematically to be a large player
3222969 people are clearer about what it is we are trying to do
3222970 you need to bring in people who fundamentally cause a quantum leap
3222971 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3222972 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3222973 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3222974 im still in the first 90 day phase so im doing a lot of learning and thinking there are strong in house attorneys who have been a great help to me
3222975 but to have a kid whos sick is that much harder
3222976 its a lot to see in four days so you try to hit the major things
3222977 it was a chance for him to get out and let these kids know theres more to life than just doctors all the time
3222978 you could move him you could shake him you could make noise and his eyes would kind of just roll back
3222979 so they hospitalized him and tried to figure out what was going on
3222980 she was like one of the nurses from ucsf is on the phone they have a kidney for him i just started crying because wed waited for a long time
3222981 but in the end its the best thing thats happened
3222982 this is our grow your own strategy each is an example that shows we can do it in kansas
3222983 if you find yourself in agreement with the green party then vote for the green party
3222984 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
3222985 if you have a green party i want to join
3222986 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
3222987 if you are not already baptized i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
3222988 we dont talk about losing we just have our eyes on what we came here to do
3222989 olympics and genocides are pretty much the only times americans pretend to care about other countries
3222990 so its nice to all the people marching around in their funny colorful hats its just like i imagined epcot would be
3222991 now i finally have something in common with mark spitz
3222992 i dont think anyone would dispute that china is a terrible bully that throws its weight around to further its own aims and distract the public from the terrible way in which it treats its own people
3222993 must use plot device here to move relationship to new enlightenment think disaster
3222994 i just wanted to save as much energy as i could for the relay
3222995 although the human brain probably possesses hundreds or even thousands of times the number of neurons that are in some of the smallest vertebrate brains and millions of times more connections it does not appear that this has correlated with a significant increase in genome size
3222996 is only the late stage expression of a fine tuning process that progresses from patterns involving the whole brain to those involving its smallest cellular branches
3222997 the process of evolution is fundamental to the universe biology is the most obvious manifestation of it theres nothing wrong with neo darwinian evolution in its own right but its not large enough to encompass what we know now
3222998 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3222999 para abrirse las venas y dejar que toda la mierda se desparrame por los suelos directamente no future
3223000 ciudades en medio del desierto desierto proclamado a base de golpe climatico y malos humos
3223001 disfruta como un cerdo en un charcho de barro debora gigantes torres de hamburguesas
3223002 esos hombres grises en los que nos estamos convirtiendo m s y m s cada d a
3223003 cada d a tiene menos horas menos minutos y solo nos quedan segundos
3223004 to open up the veins and let the trash desparrame was on the floor directly no future
3223005 cities in the middle of the desert desert proclaimed based climate and bad blow smoke
3223006 enjoy as a pig in mud eat giant towers hamburger
3223007 these gray men in which we are becoming more and more each day
3223008 every day has fewer hours fewer minutes and now there are only seconds
3223009 what im saying is in the end everyone is alone right
3223010 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3223011 transitional and restorative justice sexual and gender based violence in context
3223012 only in the last decade have we seen serious attempts to remove womens rights from the ghetto of the rights discourse
3223013 this is our challenge at this conference and in the human rights movement particularly in the context of transitional justice in africa
3223014 how do we de marginalize womens rights questions in the construction of transitional justice vehicles
3223015 we know from the historical record that sexual and gender violence is arguably the most predominant abomination in civil conflicts and wars yet we also know that this egregious form of violence is either never reported or rarely attracts the attention of the media
3223016 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3223017 i am delighted that rebecca french has agreed to lead this crucial component of the law schools research mission
3223018 her experience in studying comparative law and her enthusiasm for the possibilities of interdisciplinary approaches to the law can only strengthen the unique mission of the baldy center at the university at buffalo and beyond as we continue to enhance ub law schools academic reputation nationally and internationally the baldy center will play an important part in our continued success
3223019 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3223020 pollution and the burden of living near pollution is a pervasive issue in this region
3223021 few of these sites pose public health risks similar in severity to love canal but they all demand sustained attention to minimize short and long term risks
3223022 these findings suggest that environmental burdens are a shared concern affecting western new yorkers regardless of income level and race
3223023 so called e waste is a critical pollution issue right now especially with the growing number of household electronic devices and their short life spans
3223024 i think people are realizing that everyone plays a role
3223025 at the outset we need to understand that transitional justice concepts are experimental good experiments to be sure but that they do not offer us tested panacea because they are essentially works in progress
3223026 this is not meant to diminish the utility of the concepts or to throw cold water on them as a beachhead for recovering societies with a legacy of traumatic conflict rather it is to recognize their limitation so that we do not stampede to the temple only to find it empty of the goddess of truth
3223027 democratic citizenship and human rights the kenyan and american experiences
3223028 citizenship in the nation still means little as opposed to citizenship in the tribe
3223029 this is a result of the inability of the country to realize constitutionalism which is a unified pattern of ideas beliefs and attitudes based on a written body of law and human rights it is a challenge that can first be addressed in a commitment to a new democratic constitution that will put citizens at the center and open up opportunities for a real political and social democracy

3223044 new hampshire is a state i have grown to love
3223045 and being a political junkie there is a lot to love in the granite state it remains to be one of the countrys most politically fascinating states
3223046 a month ago one could argue that races in mississippi and alaska were tighter but as those races became less competitive new hampshire got more competitive
3223047 the general election puts this race as one of the most interesting to watch nationwide but the fact that there is a competitive primary race only makes it more interesting
3223048 new hampshire is a state in search of its political identity the once reliable republican state has now voted for a democrat for president three out of the last four times in 2004 it was the only state to switch from red to blue
3223049 when this news first fluttered across the screen a few months back i thought those bastards

3223075 its certainly the greatest olympic relay race ive ever seen said nbc announcer rowdy gaines
3223076 without a doubt its the great olympic moment ive ever experienced or called head and shoulder above anything and we have done some pretty good things said nbc analyst dan hicks
3223077 its just one of those rare moments that you get in this business to be a part of something like that and the fact that it now has a chance to continue one of the greatest olympic stories ever in michael phelps just makes it an even bigger moment
3223078 hard to put that race behind you he told nbc he had hundreds of text messages on his phone after the relay gold more than 81 million people watched the race on nbc sunday night and more than 1 million people had downloaded streams of the race on the nbc website

3223082 the increase in attendance shows that despite the doom and gloom of the economy people will come out if you give them a good show we pride ourselves on doing that and have for 59 years
3223083 we used to draw upward of 100 000 but with so much competition from other attractions in the area we have had to battle to keep families coming to our fair
3223084 our initial fairs were mostly entries from prince william farmers
3223085 ive also detected a big change in the way fairgoers dress a long time ago many came dressed in suits and dresses and now they are wearing a lot less

3223176 oggi andata bene personalmente sono tre anni che vengo a cagliari con la maglia del milan e mi porta fortuna il secondo gol stato la conseguenza di un fallo fatto su di me ma stato andrea bravissimo a trasformare la punizione adesso dobbiamo pensare a fare bene mercoled in portogallo e chiudere il girone vincendo con ronaldo mi sono trovato benissimo anche insieme a kak abbiamo provato alcune soluzioni che a volte sono riuscite altre volte meno ma andata bene cos ho saputo del girone in cui litalia stata sorteggiata per i mondiali 2010 pu sembrare un gruppo facile ma credo che siano tutte squadre preparate con giocatori esperti che conoscono bene questi tipi di tornei

3223230 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3223231 well during vietnam you welcomed draft dodgers so you should expand that today to welcome us
3223232 during vietnam canada welcomed deserters and they should today since this is another illegal war the canadian government has refused to officially sanction
3223233 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3223234 in the economic arena all of a sudden you are seeing private investment you see the electricity grid is literally all up for the first time in about three years and oild production is up by some 400 000 barrels i think in the last six months as well in part because of electricit which then means there is more fuel for the electricity
3223235 a condition thats developed from the sickness of the iraq war will be treated if qaduir gets her way by divorcing it from the very cause and treating the womens response as abnormal when what happened to their husbands was the abnormal thing instead qaduirs accepting as normal the illegal war the occupation that goes along with it and all the violence involved the only abnormal thing to her is that some women might respond in violence imagine what she would have recommended for american woman participating in the revolutionary war

3223239 the united states has spent four years and more than 20 billion on training and building iraqi security forces american instructors say the iraqis are now mostly able to fight insurgents and sectarian militias on their own

3223244 sundays attacks showed the challenges still facing american forces in iraq who number about 140 000 and the iraqi security forces who ultimately will have the task of protecting the country
3223245 a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance

3223247 the first leader to visit iraq since the fall of saddam hussein in 2003
3223248 trip was shrouded in secrecy because of security concerns and revealed only when he had headed home
3223249 ties between the two neighboring countries had been strained since the fall of saddam because of jordanian fears that iraqs shiite led government was too friendly with shiite dominated iran jordanian officials have been concerned about iranian influence in iraq and the loss of discounted oil which saddam once provided
3223250 obama spends so much time courting the rich that im not surprised that james webb has removed himself from consideration for vice president webb is the most articulate senate critic of americas class divide the most important and unfortunately the least debated issue in politics today is our drift toward a class based system the likes of which we have not seen since the 19th century

3223284 i didnt know what to expect so i was pleasantly surprised
3223285 the local stores continue to receive shipments of the nintendo wii
3223286 the demand for the wii is far greater than the supply therefore you will still find lines when you go to purchase one on delivery day be prepared to get there early and wait in line this will get worse around holiday season so try to get yours early if you can
3223287 the cell phone recycling program allows us to give other peoples used cell phones to program participants so thats men women and children who are victims of domestic violence and they can use those for 9 1 1 calls
3223288 somebody is trapped in their car their abuser is following them 9 1 1 if the kids are out of school and the wrong parents come to pick them up theres a protection order call 9 1 1 so it saves lives
3223289 they can fill out a donation form and well get a receipt for whatever they valued the donation as so they can get the tax write off as they like
3223290 obviously those funds come in very handy as were working to provide programs and services throughout collier county
3223291 were extremely challenged by this new economic reality to say the least
3223292 were all doing this overflow thing now to try to house families in the shelters as opposed to putting so many people in the drake hotel
3223293 theres no affordable housing ive been looking for a job for six months
3223294 the thing with poverty is that even if people are working one minor setback can send a whole family into a tailspin
3223295 if we can get through this economic time when we come out the other side i believe the changes will show great results
3223296 i was shocked but i also felt relief because id always suffered illness as a child and i knew i wasnt normal like my friends
3223297 the reason we have to do more is that were going to have profound consequences
3223298 first of all on the nhs which is going to have to spend a great deal of money managing people with liver disease
3223299 and then for the individuals who are going to die and lots of them just because somebody didnt offer them a test
3223300 more must be done to equip gps with the right information so they can correctly identify those who should be offered a hepatitis c test and interpret any result correctly
3223301 it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed in order to save a few pounds
3223302 helping british nationals in distress overseas is one of our most important tasks but many of the problems faced by holidaymakers are preventable
3223303 a painstaking and thorough forensic examination is being carried out
3223304 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3223305 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3223306 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3223307 we have no known motive for this savage and brutal attack
3223308 they had both worked hard while at newcastle university and both had done extremely well graduating with good degrees
3223309 excess speed is one of the main causes of collisions and this sends a strong message that the criminal justice system and our community safety partners will not tolerate this type of behaviour
3223310 a broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave is located over the central atlantic ocean about 850 miles east of the windward islands although associated shower and thunderstorm activity is currently limited environmental conditions appear favorable for gradual development
3223311 this system has the potential to become a tropical depression during the next couple of days as it moves westward at 15 to 20 mph
3223312 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3223313 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3223314 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3223315 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3223316 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent
3223317 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3223338 despite the current economic downturn the digital media sector is in a very healthy state and looks set to enjoy sustained growth over the coming years
3223339 because so many new companies chose to join the digital hub and because a number of our existing tenant companies expanded considerably in size we were presented with challenges in relation to providing the type of flexible office space and working conditions essential in the digital media sector
3223340 in addition to reaching 100 companies earlier this year another important milestone for the hub was achieved last week when the appeals to two revised planning applications under review by an bord plean la were withdrawn
3223341 this means the development of a significant amount of office and community space can now proceed and we can guarantee our companies that we will be able to continue to meet their needs as their businesses expand
3223342 it is quite clear that the board is under resourced and works under considerable pressures itself
3223343 however this situation means that the work of important publicly funded projects can be hugely held up if a set timeframe existed whereby the board was obliged to revert to developers with its planning appeals decisions within a specified time it would greatly assist state agencies public projects and all concerned in making alternative arrangements or re visiting planning applications to find new ways of meeting project needs
3223344 significant developments in relation to foreign direct investment occurred at the hub during 2007 with the addition of gala networks europe and goa games services a division of france telecom to the enterprise cluster
3223345 irish companies also enjoyed continued success including zamano which expanded its operations through the acquisition of red circle technologies
3223346 the employees in hub companies are very highly skilled and the companies typically operate in a flexible manner allowing them to quickly respond to changing market needs at any given time there are currently 750 high value knowledge employees working in the digital hub and i am confident this number will continue to rise over the coming years
3223347 this is probably a conflict where the united states would not be accepted by both sides as a mediator
3223348 the georgians would welcome american participation i suspect the russians would probably not accept us because in moscow we are seen as too close to georgia

3223354 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3223355 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3223356 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3223357 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3223358 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3223359 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3223360 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3223361 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3223362 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3223457 tidak halal bagi seorang wanita yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir melakukan safar bepergian selama satu hari satu malam yang tidak disertai mahramnya
3223458 janganlah seorang wanita melakukan safar kecuali bersama mahramnya dan janganlah seorang laki laki masuk menjumpainya kecuali disertai mahramnya
3223459 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam seolah olah ditanya tentang wanita yang melakukan safar selama tiga hari tanpa mahram lalu beliau menjawab tidak boleh dan beliau ditanya tentang perjalanannya safar selama dua hari tanpa mahram kemudian beliau menjawab tidak boleh demikian pula halnya tentang perjalanannya sehari atau setengah hari beliau tetap menjawab tidak boleh kemudian setiap dari mereka mengamalkan apa yang didengarnya oleh karena itu hadits hadits yang dibawakan dari satu riwayat dengan lafadh yang berbeda berarti hadits tersebut didengar di beberapa negeri maka perawinya kadang kadang meriwayatkan yang ini dan kadang kadang meriwayatkan yang itu dan semuanya adalah shahih
3223460 ulama sepakat bahwa dalam perkara yang bukan wajib tidak dibolehkan bagi wanita melakukan safar kecuali disertai oleh suami atau mahram yang lain terkecuali wanita kafir yang telah masuk islam di negeri musuh atau tawanan wanita yang telah berhasil meloloskan diri dari tangan tangan orang kafir mau tidak mau ia harus keluar dari lingkup mereka dengan tanpa mahram walaupun ia seorang diri bila tidak merasa takut
3223461 atau wanita yang tertinggal dari rombongannya tersesat lalu ditemukan oleh seorang laki laki yang bukan mahram yang dapat dipercaya maka boleh bagi laki laki tadi menemaninya hingga ia mendapatkan rombongannya kembali
3223462 mahram bagi wanita adalah siapa saja yang diharamkan menikah dengannya secara mutlak selamanya seperti ayah saudara laki laki keponakan laki laki dan yang dihukumi sama dengan mereka melalui susuan demikian pula suami dari putri putrinya menantu yang telah bercampur dengan mereka yakni menantu tersebut telah melakukan jima dengan putrinya sebagaimana layaknya suami istri termasuk dalam hitungan mahram bagi wanita adalah suaminya

3223465 apakah dibolehkan bagi wanita melakukan safar dalam rangka menunaikan ibadah haji tanpa disertai mahram

3223467 setelah melihat dalil dalil yang ada tampak padaku bahwa dalil dari mereka yang menyatakan tidak bolehnya adalah lebih kuat karena larangan bagi wanita melakukan safar tanpa mahram adalah bersifat umum tadi dengan demikian ia termasuk dalam larangan yang umum ini sedangkan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah bersabda apa saja yang aku larang bagi kalian maka tinggalkanlah wallahu alam
3223468 tidak boleh seorang laki laki ber khalwat dengan wanita lain dan tidak boleh bagi wanita untuk safar kecuali bersama mahramnya
3223469 wahai rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sungguh istriku ingin keluar untuk haji dan saya telah ditulis untuk ikut perang ini dan itu

3223679 i am and always have been a strong supporter of an 8 29 investigation into the levee failures that caused massive devastation in new orleans st bernard and surrounding communities in congress i have worked with sen mary landrieu to
3223680 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
3223681 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
3223682 because by reason of their obstinacy and ferocity they live in scattered groups and without intercourse with one another

3223700 im not sure that obama will actually pursue the same kind of idea that we had inserted in the platform
3223701 i think we will have to pursue our congressional representatives to bring legislation forward
3223702 to say youre going to provide affordable coverage to people is not the same as giving them health care
3223703 just because you have insurance coverage does not guarantee you access to the care that you and your doctor decide you need and people with insurance understand that
3223704 ensuring that americans have access to affordable high quality health care
3223705 for 50 years the democratic party has been engaged in a battle to provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people

3223876 the nano structure silicon thin film transistors are very promising for design of low power electronics however carrier transport in such devices is very complicated and results in electrical characteristics that may not be described by conventional field effect transistor fet models this work reveals the key physical properties of the devices which will help to further optimize and model the devices for circuit design
3223877 this study is a prime example of how leading silicon technologies entrenched in industry can find alternative routes to improve on performance in device characteristics by clever design the role that funding organizations such as epsrc play in supporting this type of applied research is invaluable to the community and most importantly to industry

3223925 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3223926 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3223927 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3223928 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
3223929 mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
3223930 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3223931 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3223932 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3223933 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3223934 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3223936 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3223937 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3223938 by the supremacy of whiteness blackness had to by necessity be its foil be its opposite
3223939 in a screening and that downey avoided being offensive by rising above buffoonery but ali who is black said he worries it could lead to more offensive portrayals
3223940 blackface is still blackface and i think its important that we have to stop allowing ourselves to be perceived as clowns to the rest of the world

3224162 these expressions are not simply stereotypes intuitively associated with pride and shame but rather may be biologically innate behavioral responses to success and failure
3224163 ekman had established that expressions were the universal products of evolution
3224164 the potentially risky open posture associated with pride and nonhuman primate dominance displays may have originated as a way of conveying the validity of the individuals belief in his her dominance or success
3224165 likely originated as a way of conveying acceptance of an aggressors power thereby removing the need for conflict and sparing resources
3224166 other gestures like end zone celebrations or removing ones jersey have not yet been traced to any evolutionary advantage

3224178 every infrastructure vendor should follow microsofts lead in giving a heads up to discovered vulnerabilities
3224179 there has been way too much finger pointing to be healthy the customer business is vulnerable up and down the stack you dont get full value out of removing an operating system vulnerability if an attack can waltz in through an application and vice versa security professionals have a responsibility to ensure that information is shared to remove as many vulnerabilities as possible
3224180 i think microsoft gets the blame every time there is a vulnerability discovered even if the security hole exists in third party software
3224181 id prefer to think that microsoft is assuming the responsibility that the customers expect from infrastructure vendors

3224203 would you like to hear about my life before this

3224207 gee funds are down lets start action on a smoke free law to raise cash from philip morris but lets not pass it so we can dip into the trough again next year
3224208 it never ceases to amaze me the amount of energy that can go into a project just to avoid doing the right thing the best simplest least costly most effective thing we could do is expand what has been working so well for years medicare you get sick you get care and the caregiver gets paid nothing could be simpler but follow the money and youll find why the politicians dont like it a bit they get their money from insurance interests
3224209 america will always do the right thing but only after everything else fails
3224210 as a business owner if i had an employee giving company assets to outsiders in exchange for money on the side id fire him perhaps even have him jailed in any other venue we call it bribery payola and theft but in the american political system we call it freedom of speech we dont jail them we re elect them
3224211 since the arabic opec conspiracy has eliminated all pretense of a capitalistic free market the u s should create its own energy supply with a taxpayer funded exploration division contract it to the lowest private bidder if need be but introduce some real competition into the system
3224212 unfortunately our political system has fallen not to the republicans or democrats but to the corporate interests that fund their elections and that is not going to change in november the only real solution is a complete turnover at the state and national level we need voter initiated term limits
3224213 privatization is the political preference because private corporations can give campaign contributions and government entities cant we are paying ten times the dollars for blackwater bechtel and halliburton to perform the same functions our troops could be performing in iraq why because the us army cannot give campaign contributions get the political money out of the system and if privatization continues because it makes more sense than creating another government bureaucracy then fine but if it continues because political cash is flowing then it likely wasnt needed in the first place

3224223 orang cenderung tidak paham bahwa lokasi pengamat amat menentukan apa yang terlihat dalam sebuah cermin
3224224 mereka menjawab berdasarkan citra yang mereka lihat di dalam cermin bukan citra di permukaannya

3224265 agfeed has direct access to the wealthiest pork consumer markets in china and captures some of the highest hog selling prices
3224266 we anticipate continued rapid expansion in these key consumer regions and expect to deliver strong financial results in our 3rd and 4th quarters
3224267 agfeed management has a realistic understanding of our business through the last 13 years of our successful corporate history we have highly skilled founders managers who are industry experts in feed and hog production we believe the pork consuming chinese population of approximately 1 2 billion people will continue to demand fresh pork on a daily basis
3224268 additionally it is our belief that chinas rapid urbanization the potentially new boost to the chinese economy from the beijing olympics and the drastic reduction in backyard hog production output have created hog shortages throughout china and are presenting agfeed with historical land grabbing growth opportunities for agfeed going forward we expect to have an expanding business for years to come we are focused on execution and delivering superb financial results for our shareholders
3224269 do you understand what cooperation is what a team is
3224270 do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose but how we play together as a team
3224271 im sure you know that you shouldnt argue curse attack the referee or call him an idiot do you understand all that
3224272 definitely its going to be an exciting time hopefully there will be more cheers than boos

3224276 it just makes us so much better from a coverage standpoint
3224277 hell be a tremendous asset this is the type of safety you look for in the draft a guy who can hit but still has coverage ability as well
3224278 you would like to get those reps and get that chemistry going but hes a veteran player
3224279 im hoping he wont be on the shelf that long
3224280 he has been playing faster than when we were in organized team activities when we were going through installation
3224281 we found it was being broadcast live online from las vegas and there were 15 or 20 of us crowded around this little laptop
3224282 he never went into anything saying im going to win this
3224283 hes the best member of a team you could imagine
3224284 people come up to us and say do you know some anoka wrestler is in the olympics
3224285 youd try to get one move on him and then brag about it
3224286 its probably the one sport i would say has the biggest alumni following and support

3224301 it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed in order to save a few pounds

3224303 will be used to reduce delays and enhance capacity at new york area airports
3224304 this auction will allow us to implement market mechanisms on a small scale gauge interest and determine a slots market value
3224305 however the real winners in this auction will be consumers who stand to benefit from more reliable air service that costs less in terms of both time and money
3224306 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3224307 every transportation administration except this one has acknowledged that it does not have the authority to implement auctions and other so called market mechanisms yet this administration believes it can ignore the statutory limits of its authority to remake the industry as it sees fit
3224308 we said that we would challenge the faa decision in a court of law and we are doing just that today we have started the process to protect our members rights
3224309 should be held unlawful and set aside because these actions are in excess of the faas statutory authority constitute unauthorized regulatory action disguised as property management are contrary to express statutory limitations imposed by congress in the 2008 consolidated appropriations act are without observance of procedure required by law and are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law
3224310 faas plan is not only unlawful it is both surprising and perplexing it is surprising because the end result will be more flights during the busiest times of the day at newark even as we suffer through yet another delay plagued summer and it is perplexing because the announced slot auction precedes formal rules to auction slots at newark and other airports
3224311 sadly faa believes that it has the right to make up the rules as it goes along faa should focus its efforts on fulfilling its responsibility to provide the infrastructure and air traffic resources necessary to meet the publics demand for safe air transportation services instead of finding new ways to inhibit economic growth and further tax an already overtaxed traveling public
3224312 as weve made clear numerous times the solution to combating flight delays is increasing capacity improving customer service and replacing a decades old air traffic control system not auctions that will raise ticket prices for the exact same delays we will continue to block any effort by the dot and faa to implement this auction system at our airports
3224313 if a person points a 9mm at you and pulls the trigger youre just as dead whether theyre 15 or 25
3224314 the death penalty is a specific punishment set aside for certain crimes and it has nothing to do with the age as long as the person is 18 years old or older
3224315 if they are both involved and were equally comfortable in the process of killing this young lady then i think they deserve the same punishment

3224321 i think some people who hadnt paid attention to the issue because it was not in their metropolitan area will begin to pay attention
3224322 and the fact that michael steinhardt is backing the initiative will bring other people to point of paying attention when they might not have before
3224323 what if we unrolled a nationwide system of jewish charter schools focusing on jewish elements not on religious studies which appeals only to a minority of jews anyway but on the elements of jewish culture that make us strong
3224324 it is clear that charter schools might be a solution to our communal needs we would be foolish to ignore their potential
3224325 if were the jalopy held together by rubber bands theyre google founder sergey brins 747
3224326 theyre spending time and effort on curriculum development that we could never afford
3224327 one of the central purposes of public education in america is to bring kids from different backgrounds together to teach them what they have in common to be tolerant citizens in a democracy
3224328 id have some concerns about any charter school or public school which is aimed at a particular racial group ethnic group language group
3224329 theres something very beautiful about teaching all kinds of kids hebrew
3224330 in this district theres a caribbean population a chinese population african americans russians israeli immigrants i think its a very jewish idea of everyone being taught this very great language

3224351 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3224352 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3224353 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3224354 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3224355 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel

3224371 school districts throughout california are mistreating our children suffocating the growth of charter schools and offering inadequate facilities and disproportionate funding
3224372 through families that can our families will fight unfair moves by school districts such as los angeles unified and will demand equal education equal treatment and equal resources for our kids
3224373 charter school students are public school students yet they dont have the same access to resources funding and facilities that traditional public schools do
3224374 los angeles unified continues to create obstacles for charter schools by withholding 80 million in construction bonds and leaving dozens of schools operating out of inadequate facilities
3224375 if an attorney is handpicked by a judge to service all of the cases in front of the judge and if the attorney is compensated through a contract approved by the judge and if the attorneys continued employment is conditioned upon the judges satisfaction with the attorney there is more than a fair chance that the attorney will be in a position whether intended or not that loyalties will be compromised between the judge and client

3224402 we typically make fun of bungled police operations by saying they were conducted by the gang that couldnt shoot straight
3224403 in this case they could shoot straight as a result they killed a familys two dogs in the midst of a misguided drug raid
3224404 rather than carefully checking the facts including talking to the local police department the county authorities acted rashly illustrating how the drug war threatens the liberties of all americans
3224405 absent exigent circumstances not present here so called no knock raids are an affront to the constitution
3224406 so is a shoot first ask questions later philosophy by the police yet the prince georges police have done this before last fall they invaded a house at the wrong address and shot the family dog all americans are at risk when the police behave this way just ask yourself what might happen if a suspicious package is delivered to your home and the cops bust in
3224407 but there is an even larger point law enforcement agencies have become more arrogant and less accountable in cases other than those involving drugs most people are aware of well publicized examples like waco and ruby ridge but similar abuses are common across the country though they usually receive little or no public notice
3224408 we all want police to do their jobs well but part of doing their job well is respecting the peoples constitutional liberties
3224409 with the biopharmaceutical industry increasingly relying on outsourcing these new offices are important to our strategic growth in areas where there is high demand for our global experience and therapeutic expertise

3224412 there are several designer cancer drugs that fight tumors driven by egfr like receptors such as herceptin erbitux and tarceva
3224413 whereas these drugs all attack the receptor itself an argos like drug would instead neutralize the cancer growth factor by mimicking a silent receptor this is a change in paradigm for tumor growth inhibition in this class of cancers
3224414 these vaccines were created using a system that we think is applicable to producing vaccines that can protect against a wide range of diseases caused by the flaviviruses an important family of viruses that afflict populations throughout the world
3224415 flaviviruses cause tremendous human suffering but we still only have vaccines for a few of them
3224416 with these vaccines we mimic a viral infection and get amplification of the antigens that are important for stimulating an immune response without amplification of the virus
3224417 scientists interested in ageing have developed mice that lack p16 or p19 but these mice were not suitable for studies on ageing because they all die of cancer before they even begin to age
3224418 by crossing these mice with a mouse strain that ages five times faster than normal due to a mutation in the bubr1 gene we were able to bypass this problem

3224470 nosotros tenemos nuestras tiendas aqu y somos una parte directamente afectada sin embargo nadie del ayuntamiento nos ha llamado para explicarnos nada y nos hemos tenido que enterar por la prensa

3224475 la violencia de este agresor ha quedado demostrada por que no s lo ha pegado a una mujer y le iba a pegar cuando ya estaba en el suelo sino que a mi marido le agredi por la espalda y le sigui golpeando salvajemente cuando ya estaba en el suelo
3224476 tramitar y aprobar una nueva delimitaci n de dominio p blico mar timo terrestre entre los mojones m 34 y m 46 del deslinde que est en vigor que a diferencia de ste y como exige la ley cuente con los estudios geomorfol gicos necesarios y con la informaci n fidedigna de los terrenos hasta donde han llegado las olas en los m ximos temporales conocidos

3224481 saber que existe un nuevo director general de costas y que toda la c pula directiva del organismo que depende del ministerio de medio ambiente es tambi n nueva esperamos otra actitud muy distinta a la que han mantenido los anteriores dirigentes

3224497 tras haber subido el ibi en la anterior legislatura hasta el 300 nos va a llevar a situaciones dif ciles y conflictivas
3224498 en vez de fre r a impuestos a los ciudadanos recortando los sueldazos de ediles y enchufados o las subvenciones a los clubs de los amiguetes
3224499 los nicos titulares de ese local que han conseguido mantener un nivel de decibelios aceptable porque hasta 2003 todos los anteriores due os han rebasado la normativa
3224500 hemos denunciado ante el ayuntamiento el s ndic de greuges y la propia generalitat y si consegu amos que sancionasen al local por exceso de ruido a los pocos meses volv an a abrir con la m sica m s alta
3224501 de los pocos que ha decidido quedarse porque la mayor a se han marchado la m sica hace temblar hasta las ventanas y es imposible dormir cualquier noche de fin de semana
3224502 entonces el ruido se consideraba infracci n leve y bastaba con pagar una multa lo que permit a aut nticas barbaridades desde 2002 la contaminaci n ac stica es delito as que en los locales reincidentes ahora colocamos limitadores que impiden a los equipos de sonido superar los decibelios que marcamos
3224503 las auditor as ac sticas no sirven para nada porque estas empresas saben que si el informe que emiten no es favorable no cobran los mil y pico euros que le cuesta al contratista hacer esta medici n

3224529 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3224530 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3224531 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3224532 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3224533 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3224534 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3224535 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3224536 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3224537 it is taking a little bit longer than originally expected

3224541 after taking a close look at the candidates in this race i was more impressed by senator clintons ability to meet the challenges of the presidency end the war reinvigorate the economy and provide universal healthcare
3224542 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night ill be very tired by the morning
3224543 you only have to find three strong girls for each event so were confident we can come away with a good score
3224544 ive told them dont dwell on mistakes and make sure you stay focused
3224545 most of the main roads in the provinces are covered with thick a layer of mud from landslides so it is very difficult for vehicles to move around
3224546 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3224547 our problem now is we cant get in because of the security aspect we are being prevented from going in by the international committee of the red cross because of the unstable situation
3224548 but we are preparing for a big rush of food and medicine and all things that they need
3224549 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3224550 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet

3224556 we dont try to protect our data amp come up with new formats only for marketing reasons we use existing standards as much as possible and allow fl studio to be used as a plugin in other hosts
3224557 if things go right we can start talking about forever
3224558 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
3224559 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
3224560 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
3224561 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3224562 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
3224563 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
3224564 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
3224565 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
3224566 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
3224567 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
3224568 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
3224569 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
3224570 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
3224571 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it
3224572 around 11 percent of businesses in the us are using ubuntu according to a recent idc report
3224573 constantly increasing the number of products that are built and certified to run on ubuntu
3224574 a lot of the commodity funds seem to be unwinding positions and us us dollars are getting bought at the same time as they are selling aussie

3224583 console gamers young heavy gamers and extreme gamers are more likely to use consoles than a pc to play video games

3224588 officers would be demoted or dismissed while soldiers were to face demerit if caught driving after drinking
3224589 thats a substantial business it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3224590 with this game meaning so much for sweden i think theyre going to come out very strong theyre a physical team were both big theres going to be some bruises after
3224591 they are not considered one of the outright favourites but that can work to your advantage in a tournament format building momentum is crucial
3224592 victory there could propel the canadians on to the later stages of the tournament

3224595 were not concerned about health of the trees or aesthetics
3224596 in the past we trimmed some trees but now we remove them
3224597 our responsibility is to ensure the reliability of our system
3224598 any accident is caused by a chain of errors and if you eliminate any one link in the chain you generally eliminate the incident
3224599 tree trimming will make a big difference because right of way incursions is one of the biggest reasons why we have outages in general
3224600 unreasonable clear cutting of trees when theyre not a threat to the safety of the high tension electric wires

3224607 die heimtrainer haben meine trainingspl ne nicht konsequent befolgt die h hentrainingslager wurden nicht durchgezogen meine anweisungen nicht immer bedingungslos befolgt
3224608 in erfolgreichen schwimm nationen werden die trainingsinhalte innovativ kreativ und individuell gestaltet dort werden die inhalte nicht f r alle athleten verpflichtend von oben verordnet
3224609 ich kann ja nichts daf r dass uns die weltelite derart enteilt ist

3224617 i n the new study to be published in the quarterly journal of experimental psychology scientists ran four experiments in which participants were presented with complex decisions and asked to choose the best option immediately
3224618 a little bit of shock and probably more relief i guess
3224619 it has been a long journey its been a long eight years
3224620 and i think just a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it i couldnt care less about the time
3224621 an olympic gold is an olympic gold it really didnt matter how it went how i raced i couldnt care less
3224622 i woke up and i was just so excited i think i was excited about racing
3224623 i was almost skipping out there i was so excited i really enjoyed it
3224624 i think ive enjoyed it so much i think i would hate to finish and know there was still a flame burning inside
3224625 i think ive still go so much more growing to do and so much more learning
3224626 amanda beards on her fourth olympics so its certainly not out of the question
3224627 i think you have got to put a lot of that down to the preoccupation with security
3224628 but security youre in the hands of the host organisers
3224629 and they havent been able to manage the balance between security and creating that atmosphere i suppose
3224630 its not the first i certainly remember it in 1992 barcelona there were those tanks outside every olympic family hotel
3224631 and certainly that was the case in 76 and the case in 80
3224632 i havent slept for ten days because that would be too long

3224659 everybody should be writing their own kind of cool have we learned nothing from john hughes movies
3224660 i admire people who dont look left or right they refuse to get information on what theyre supposed to do its not about what my car says about me its about being better at choosing the pursuits in life that make you most interested you have to be around people with their own pursuits
3224661 whats the directionality of cool or uncool youre either free or not free im wearing a mickey mouse shirt and reebok pumps right now and i think thats pretty cool
3224662 the setlists have always rotated on a lazy susan but now these are different each and every night
3224663 you know what worries me about it its the lowest common denominator if you dont raise the bar and im not trying to be elitist here but if you dont raise the bar for the public they may not raise the bar themselves
3224664 its like oh i can eat sugar ok then ill eat sugar i can eat as much as i want well ill do that i dont have to eat the chicken and the veggies i wont but we need chicken and veggies man eat some chicken and veggies
3224665 ill continue to have marital problems and problems with my teenage daughter

3224667 weve always stayed on the same path which were still on we still have plans to get together and do our thing
3224668 i would rather control my cholesterol with exercise and diet simply because when you do put drugs in your body youre going to have side effects

3224673 african american women have learned to navigate through race class and gender and go for what they want despite the challenges
3224674 i think there are still social limitations but they can be blasted if a woman really chooses to do it
3224675 its like the superwoman complex gone bad not only can we do it all we are expected to do it all and were doing double time to catch up and surpass the expectations
3224676 even though we are getting lower pay its becoming more of the standard for a woman to bring home the bacon cook it and run the industry that sells it
3224677 increasing our enjoyment and appreciation of our region and our historical place in the landscape
3224678 as we learn more about these plants we learn to appreciate our place in the environment
3224679 you have to realize we are a prairie here in kansas city and those things that were here to begin with they thrive
3224680 but i sometimes question the wisdom of a strictly native garden because it can be a boring midsummer palette
3224681 i i i got my cast off mommy i i i had a boo boo an i got my cast off

3224701 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
3224702 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3224703 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
3224704 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
3224705 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future
3224706 youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it

3224708 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3224709 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3224710 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3224711 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3224712 es lo que se vende y por eso lo hacemos
3224713 i guess theres no more stop any more i guess they took it away because of vandalism or something but i found out theyre going to replace it with a brand new one which is good its about time
3224714 well in that case were actually upgrading that bus stop we have an existing old bus structure there that we feel its about time we tear that one down and replace it with a new one so that ones going to be back in service as soon as theyre done demolishing it and building a new one
3224715 were tending to go toward stools instead of benches at these bus stops to address some of the issues when people choose to use that as a sleeping place rather than a bus stop
3224716 the issue there is that if you have a mid block stop person gets off the bus the tendency is even if we have signs that encourage them to go to the nearest intersection they have a tendency to cross right where they got off the bus
3224717 i dont think it makes much difference to us we prefer the trees and the shade and its just beautiful in honolulu and a bus stop here and a bus stop there is immaterial to us
3224718 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury

3224731 this has been possible on account of joint efforts of the forest department and the indian railways joint patrolling along the tracks that run through the park has been very helpful in checking accidents there have been occasions when railway drivers have reduced their speed or even stopped trains on coming to know of elephants in the vicinity of the tracks

3224780 there is no requirement to consult on greenhouse gas emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species
3224781 the proposed rule is consistent with the wildlife services current understanding that it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas ghg emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3224782 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
3224783 this is the most egregious and sweeping assault in a string of attacks on the endangered species act by this administration if these regulations had been in play for the past few decades we would not have brought the bald eagle back from the brink of extinction

3224788 my gp used to test me for diabetes and anaemia but i knew it wasnt either of those because the blood tests always showed up negative
3224789 i was shocked but i also felt relief because id always suffered
3224790 the reason we have to do more is that were going to have profound consequences
3224791 and then for the individuals who are going to die and lots of them just because somebody didnt offer them a test
3224792 more must be done to equip gps with the right information so they can correctly identify those who should be offered a hepatitis c test and interpret any result correctly

3224802 e nergy and fuel price rises as all of us know are hurting families and hurting businesses everywhere and they pose a real risk to the stability and a real risk of imposing damage on the global economy
3224803 meeting our climate change goals requires britain to become a clean economy that is to replace many traditional fossil fuels with low carbon sources of energy right across this country and to do so at much lower levels of energy demand than currently projected and we must start now
3224804 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our energy targets through the planning bill we are also looking to speed up the planning process for developers and improve consultations to make sure wind farms are built in the right places

3224815 barangsiapa yang tidur dalam keadaan suci maka malaikat akan bersamanya di dalam pakaiannya dia tidak akan bangun hingga malaikat berdoa ya allah ampunilah hambamu si fulan karena tidur dalam keadaan suci
3224816 tidaklah salah seorang diantara kalian yang duduk menunggu shalat selama ia berada dalam keadaan suci kecuali para malaikat akan mendoakannya ya allah ampunilah ia
3224817 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikat nya bershalawat kepada orang orang yang berada pada shaf shaf terdepan
3224818 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikat selalu bershalawat kepada orang orang yang menyambung shaf shaf
3224819 jika seorang imam membaca ghairil maghdhuubi alaihim waladh dhaalinn maka ucapkanlah oleh kalian aamiin karena barangsiapa ucapannya itu bertepatan dengan ucapan malaikat maka ia akan diampuni dosanya yang masa lalu
3224820 para malaikat akan selalu bershalawat kepada salah satu diantara kalian selama ia ada di dalam tempat shalat dimana ia melakukan shalat selama ia belum batal wudhunya para malaikat berkata ya allah ampunilah dan sayangilah ia
3224821 para malaikat berkumpul pada saat shalat shubuh lalu para malaikat yang menyertai hamba pada malam hari yang sudah bertugas malam hari hingga shubuh naik ke langit dan malaikat pada siang hari tetap tinggal kemudian mereka berkumpul lagi pada waktu shalat ashar dan malaikat yang ditugaskan pada siang hari hingga shalat ashar naik ke langit sedangkan malaikat yang bertugas pada malam hari tetap tinggal lalu allah bertanya kepada mereka bagaimana kalian meninggalkan hambaku mereka menjawab kami datang sedangkan mereka sedang melakukan shalat dan kami tinggalkan mereka sedangkan mereka sedang melakukan shalat maka ampunilah mereka pada hari kiamat
3224822 doa seorang muslim untuk saudaranya yang dilakukan tanpa sepengetahuan orang yang didoakannya adalah doa yang akan dikabulkan
3224823 tidak satu hari pun dimana pagi harinya seorang hamba ada padanya kecuali 2 malaikat turun kepadanya salah satu diantara keduanya berkata ya allah berikanlah ganti bagi orang yang berinfak
3224824 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikat nya bershalawat kepada orang orang yang sedang makan sahur
3224825 tidaklah seorang mukmin menjenguk saudaranya kecuali allah akan mengutus 70 000 malaikat untuknya yang akan bershalawat kepadanya di waktu siang kapan saja hingga sore dan di waktu malam kapan saja hingga shubuh
3224826 keutamaan seorang alim atas seorang ahli ibadah bagaikan keutamaanku atas seorang yang paling rendah diantara kalian sesungguhnya penghuni langit dan bumi bahkan semut yang di dalam lubangnya dan bahkan ikan semuanya bershalawat kepada orang yang mengajarkan kebaikan kepada orang lain
3224827 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was
3224828 because i want to help people like you and your family
3224829 are you the kind of person who cuts in during a traffic jam
3224830 the most surprising thing about the late merge concept is that it showed
3224831 and lit up the restaurant when we won it in the 10th
3224832 allowing public access to the mitchell slough allows the trashing of resources
3224833 but in montana its all public they are trying to privatize our streams
3224834 the frightened staff asked us not to identify the venue in any way
3224835 are you sure were not watching one of the womens races
3224836 it was some kind of weird glitch in her karma
3224837 throw in some intangible extra special something that you cant put your finger on
3224838 you cant really explain what it is were just better
3224839 its the only continuity in my life everything else could go to hell but i still get excited about music
3224840 i can live without the jewelry but cant be broke
3224841 we have no illusions of the industry and the old business model or the unknown territory that were stepping into with the digital age
3224842 the reality of it is were not going to be selling music were going to be giving away free dope music just come to the shows and buy a shirt
3224843 if youre gonna do it best you do it yourself
3224844 the problem is tax dollars being used to subsidies films any films so lets address that problem directly giving new powers to the heritage minister to watch over the film industry doesnt sound like a solution to me
3224845 if we cant even count on the conservatives to get us out of the business of financing film what hope do we have that theyll limit the scope of government in more important areas
3224846 the conservative strategy behind bill c 10 had nothing to do with making government smaller or reducing the role of the state it had everything to do with appeasing the social conservative base of the party
3224847 this conservatives sic are clearly demonstrating their willingness to sacrifice canadas arts and culture on the altar of ideology
3224848 fringe art groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
3224849 citizens buy art watch films and television dance and celebrate traditions all on their own with or without the governments help when the state steps in to throw dollars at cultural goals or artistic industries a pandoras box is opened for taxpayers
3224850 strip away the list of irreconcilable and contradictory goals of cultural policy and something different appears
3224851 itu tandanya kamu suruh ngeliatin dia pake mobil apa ah dee ga kelingan yen asline wong mrenjen denmark mranggen demak

3224853 i cant think of anything that i genuinely enjoyed this much from the get go
3224854 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff bewkes and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3224855 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3224856 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3224857 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3224858 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3224859 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3224860 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3224861 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3224862 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3224863 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3224864 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3224865 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3224866 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3224867 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective
3224868 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
3224869 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3224870 ive been waiting for this gold medal for eight years
3224871 this time on the stage has been a perfect ending to my career
3224872 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3224873 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3224874 there are similarities between shooting in the wild and at competitions
3224875 dove hunting definitely helps here because the target presentations are similar
3224876 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3224877 two more days of racing and hopefully the medal race if everything goes well i feel fine with the position im in
3224878 sekarang karena usia sudah lanjut saya buka kepada publik bahwa sayalah sebenarnya supriyadi
3224879 clearly this new york lizza partnership is built to last
3224880 she explains to be fair she gets emotional when her heart is out to lunch but whatever this is touching damn it
3224881 speak to the priests the sons of aaron and say to them a priest must not make himself ceremonially unclean for any of his people who die
3224882 priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies
3224883 they must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands because priests are holy to their god
3224884 if a priests daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute she disgraces her father she must be burned in the fire
3224885 the high priest the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes
3224886 say to aaron for the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his god
3224887 weve been in kampala a while now we know the price
3224888 hang on well do it for 400 come on be fair

3224891 were late and youre making everyone else late well pay 15 pence let us go please
3224892 why would i buy half a newspaper for the full price
3224893 youre all going to end up as soup or if youre really lucky alongside rice in a delicious curry
3224894 why oh why did dawn entrust me with all of the responsibility for her own wedding
3224895 i like being a seprate person from my school i love my friends and teachers and all that jazz at school but i dont want to become a part of it like other people i live my own life outside of other peoples why should i feel a need to get into it and know everything that goes on and be a problem in it
3224896 did you hear that toady i dont know she calls us all toady shaved pussy aaaahahahahahahaaha
3224897 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you

3224900 i know its hard to be original in fact nothing scares me more because jesus only lets me do what has been done before
3224901 as a general rule i dont encourage pill splitting but i know there are pharmacists and physicians who will encourage that especially for some hypertension drugs like hydrochlorathiazide
3224902 unless it is scored for that purpose tablets should not be cut in half if a tablet is cut in half the accuracy of the dosage cannot be predicted
3224903 an intact tablet is meant to dissolve and be absorbed at a certain rate which may occur faster when the tablet is broken this may lead to adverse events due to faster absorption of the product or to lessened efficacy due to product degradation in addition an intact tablet is able to better resist changes in room temperature and humidity than a split tablet the impact of altering a tablets coating on a products action is not known and has not been well studied
3224904 the chance of causing danger by splitting certain types of pills is effectively zero
3224905 if half of the pill is slightly less then a person will take the other slightly larger half the next day

3224907 the curtains are about to close on nascar wal mart and the suburban way of life you better get serious about local food production because the days of large scale agribusiness with a just in time distribution system run by refrigerated diesel trucks are numbered
3224908 pop you talk sometimes about the old days the pictures youve shown me the things you describe why arent things that way now what happened
3224909 well really to understand you have to go way back thousands of years people learned how to grow their food and then they started storing it instead of just foraging for what they ate at the time people all over the earth gradually started learning more about agriculture and it came about for different reasons in different times in different ways
3224910 as food surpluses formed the groups realized that not everyone needed to work in the fields so people started doing other things some people worked on pottery to store the food other people worked as food traders as more people had more time on their hands more specialized roles came about they then realized they needed more complicated politics to manage all these complications that came about because of all these new roles some people had enough time on their hand to focus purely on art and lots of really wonderful things came about because of it besides the not so good things like tax collectors
3224911 i still have no idea what youre talking about what does that have to do with the old days
3224912 it has to do with how the idea of large civilizations empires and nations started because they basically had extra food which lead to extra wealth which lead to people learning that they liked to own things which lead to more people in each group which lead to arguments between groups for what they owned when one group had more than the other
3224913 so you see son over the course of history we got better and better at using technology to control nature for our benefit and we became really good at using nature to build things that allowed us to live lives with very specific purposes without giving much thought to how we came about our basic needs we became really good at using natures resources for energy and based our lives more and more on that energy
3224914 it took nature millions of years to build this energy up but we used about half of this energy in about 100 years we had so much energy that it was like having hundreds of servants that supported each of us for a very low cost
3224915 these servants were like invisible machines you didnt even think about that much these machines were the ones that produced packaged and shipped our food thousands of miles these machines were the ones that powered all the machines inside our homes and at our places of work and allowed us to travel thousands of miles in a few hours without much thought these machines support every aspect of how we lived and gave us more abundance than had ever been experienced in human history so we had lots of time on our hands for leisure and other things
3224916 within just a couple of generations we became spoiled and expected that these invisible machines powered by a surplus of natures energy would be there forever because we figured out a way to use up these resources so quickly and use them to power enormous farms without much manual labor the number of people in the world shot up from 1 billion to 7 billion people over 200 years
3224917 think about that son it took tens of thousands of years to get to 1 billion but only 200 years to add 6 billion more
3224918 so oil and other resources powered the machines that allowed the population to grow so quickly
3224919 ok but you said we used half of the energy i still dont get it why dont we live like that now
3224920 well theres plenty of energy thats not really the problem you see things really heated up near the end of the 20 th century for most of the 20 th century much of the worlds resources were eaten up by a few rich countries and there was a large gap in wealth between rich and poor countries
3224921 as the rich countries used up most of their own resources they started moving their factories over to the poor countries where there were still resources to be had the rich countries learned to base their way of life not so much on building things but on instead on buying selling and financing things that were made in the poor countries
3224922 the rich countries were able to do this for a while because it was easy to build something in on one side of the world and ship it to the other and the rich countries controlled the money the banks and the politics in the poor countries so they made it easier for people in the rich countries to live as though they produced much more value than they really did and buy more of things on credit which was just money they hadnt earned yet or might never really earn backed by things that werent really worth as much as they claimed to be like the houses they lived in
3224923 i cant even imagine that but what about the half though
3224924 the world needed oil and other key resources just like your body needs water your body is something like 60 water youre about 100 pounds so 60 pounds is water now if you work outside and overdo it youll dehydrate long before you lose all 60 pounds of course you only need to lose a couple of pounds of water and your body systems start to shut down and soon your body collapses thats something like what happened years ago with other things when price went up demand when down but oil was so critical to everything that all bets where off when supply just couldnt keep up with demand
3224925 you see the poorer countries were getting richer and suddenly they had more money to spend on things and they used more of their own energy and so they had less to sell to the rich countries and in many countries with resources after a half a century of being pushed around by the rich countries the people there demanded that the resources be used in their own countries by their own people instead of being burned up in other countries
3224926 this was a huge power shift so the rich countries were spending more becoming poorer and competing against other countries for a shrinking supply at the same time it was much harder and cost a lot more to get to the last half of the oil not just high in what it cost in paper money but in much higher costs of other resources like fresh water and metals used to pull it out of the ground
3224927 but didnt smart people understand this didnt some people try and warn the rest even i can see if you have more people needing more of something which there is less and less of you have a problem
3224928 youve just nailed down the problem better than most people could back then but sure there were many people who talked about this sort of thing it had been understood for decades but the forces in effect were very powerful
3224929 what does that mean why didnt you find another way why did you mess things up so badly for us
3224930 lots of really smart people were working hard on another way in a lot of different ways but in the end nature does as nature does things level out looking back we did seem to put too much faith in technology were fixed to a certain way of life and didnt admit some very important things to ourselves
3224931 at the same time our needs for these resources overran our ability to pull them out of the ground fast enough and different groups of people became more and more desperate to get what they needed at any cost even if it meant fighting over them and going to war but even if we could pull them out of the ground fast enough there were all these other problems like changing weather patterns that caused floods and lowered crop yields to deal with
3224932 back in the old days people who talked about these types of things were called alarmists up until the point when it became clearer that they were sounding the alarms for good reason the famous expression was the stone age didnt end because we ran out of stones so the oil age wont end because we ran out of oil plus truth be told there have been people talking about gloom and doom since the dawn of man and since oil was discovered there was always a group running around claiming it was about to run out so people have just learned to silence them out for the most part and normally theyre wise to silence them out until they arent
3224933 see back then it was more popular to be falsely optimistic than realistic writers sold books on the secret to success and it was tough for people to have frank conversations about these sorts of things around in the feel good kind of culture that we had
3224934 there was a sort of trance that fed off one another deep down though many people knew about the problems even though they all saw it in different ways but normally took to one or a combination of three roads as an outlet big money politics blind faith in the markets or blame
3224935 the trouble with politics was that it put people in power who promised more of the public funds to voters and special favors to the big companies which want short term profits and business as usual to keep going as long as possible companies needed to get back the money they spent on many things that depended on oil and no one wanted to admit it but just about everyone was part of the corporate system and benefiting because of the sytem in place at some level and what politician would get elected if he said put your wallets down do your best to accumulate less and learn to raise chickens after all wheres the progress in that
3224936 at the time when things really began to fall apart the politicians best solutions were mostly boondoggles which is a fancy way of getting some money for not much good based on short term thinking like burning our last layer of topsoil in our gas tanks or big tax breaks to run your car on kitchen grease its one thing to come up with other ways of making energy but decades to try and change over everything about a world designed to run on fossil fuels and we started decades too late
3224937 the trouble with too much faith in free markets where smart people get other peoples money and build things that help make a better world is that the things called signals that tell the markets to do something didnt come in time for a change this drastic and also markets werent really free and the market didnt do a good job of making a number of small scale local solutions to help deal with inevitable collapse to some degree the market was looking for large scale solutions to keep a world based mostly on having cars on the road at any cost and those big efforts will always fail in times of crisis because the things that the big efforts need to be successful will fall out of place make sense
3224938 sure a lot of windmills went up all over places like west texas and solar panels started appearing on everyones homes normally those technologies that could use the things in place for the last techology were chosen the power lines and ways to get that energy from where it was created to where it would be used this is why everyone talked about things like hydrogen but it never really got off the ground how on earth would you store and transport it without decades of conversion plus it depended on too much of everything else that was already in short supply
3224939 sure what people called alternative energy was a good thing but the impact was too small and it took too much of the old oil and gas technologies to maintain and power the distribution systems which were already pushed passed their limits plus everyone just expected to keep living like they did only with some substitution and think about what happens when you needed to replace a solar panel on your roof but you couldnt get replacement parts with industry coming to a halt and no trucks on the road
3224940 but the worst outlet was blame people started blaming the oil companies the government other countries immigrants the speculators and so on and so on a lot of people who took responsibility and knew they were as much a part of the problem and took some blame still felt paralyzed in taking any real action
3224941 those people had jobs they spent their whole life preparing for and many lived in houses they spent most their money they earned on so they wondered what they could they do but do what they did as long as they could do it sure some close knit communities saw the writing on the wall and worked together on ways to keep the lights on water flowing and food on their tables but not many
3224942 things would happen at a faster pace and then get normal for a while at least what we then thought of normal before things started happening fast again people in different places experienced different things at different times it wasnt like something just happened and the world stopped we were just experiencing what the rest of the world had been experiencing for years it was all about where you were standing and you still had the experts on tv talking about how housing was going to turn around next year or some money guy saying inflation wasnt that bad people were still debating about whether or not the country was in a recession when signs of collapse where everywhere
3224943 some banks would close their doors more people would lose their houses people who worked for the cities stopped getting their pension checks because the cities were going broke too the government would step in with some attempt at a bailout plan and there was some talk about starting some type of new new deal program in certain areas to rebuild things and put the country back to work
3224944 over time the potholes in roads wouldnt get repaired like they once did schools started going to 3 day weeks before some had to close their doors garbage pickups moved to once every other week the airlines went under until the industry collapsed into a single airline backed by the government but travel was just something most people couldnt do anymore
3224945 meanwhile the price of oil didnt go up in a straight line stock and commodity prices were all over the map as the market tried to price in scarcity which would drive prices up and a collapsing world economy which would drive prices down so the energy companies couldnt really make good business decisions even if they wanted to continue with their drilling programs in the arctic circle not that it would have done much but you heard a lot of talk about the need to drill everywhere it just got to the point where price didnt matter it was availability
3224946 then stores would be open one day and a closed sign would appear over the door the next truckers would strike and stop delivering medical food and other supplies but it was never well organized and it became less about their anger over the high costs and more about having to park their trucks because there was no fuel due to what amounted to hoarding by some of the big lines and people learned quickly that the real emergency was less about fuel in their tanks but the lack of food on the shelves due to fertilizer shortages on the farms power shortages in the plants and fuel shortages for the trucks and trains some people panicked some people just waited for a government which was becoming just as immobile as its people to do something
3224947 the national energy security act put fuel rationing and forced conservation into place which seemed silly because the word conservation made it sound like you had a choice the government was slow to hand out the emergency funds checks and ration tickets people would barter with one another to get more tickets but it was a mess since all the machines were on computer and the stations that were open didnt have the extra people to monitor the tickets people were angry confused and on the move people moved from north to south because they could no longer heat their homes while people moved from south to north because their unventilated boxed in homes without air conditioning were unliveable
3224948 the news stopped reporting so much because that only made people panic more
3224949 just as youd adapt to the new situation as best you could something else would happen the internet was the best way to keep in contact with the rest of the world until we lost our connection when im guessing the backup battery power at the network access point just ran out it came back for a while before going out again the utilities held pretty well in our area but eventually the blackouts would happen regularly until the maintenance trucks completely stopped and the gas had to be turned off for safety reasons because of low pressure
3224950 you know son the good old days werent always so good
3224951 the first reaction to the power emergency took the form of a rush for candles refilling of gas bottles and the purchasing of generators if you could get them then the complacency set it business learnt to sit through power outages retail shops were forced to close their doors for a few hours a day there was and is a shortage of food supplies food went bad in the fridges and had to been thrown away it was kind of charming in a strange kind of way to eat dinner by candle light and forgo the soapies on tv traffic lights were out over a large number of suburbs and delays in getting to business meetings became the norm the schools are unable to teach a full days lesson the internet service providers and the mobile phone companies frequently have service delays or are just plain off line the battery runs out on your laptop and thats the days productive work is over until the power is back on patients in icu or undergoing operations as the power grid went down were at risk of and did die

3224956 yes the terrorist attack was real and it required a strong military response but the response chosen by the bush administration carried the nation into a fantasy land created by a misrepresentation of reality in reality terrorists are best dealt with by methods other than waging war
3224957 since 1980 the unwillingness to face reality has been exacerbated by globalization a global economy based on the principles of market fundamentalism is full of uncertainties from which many people are eager to escape fundamentalist religion seems to avoid the soul searching that has characterized christian religions since the time of jesus and appears to do everything to reward the faithful by making them feel good

3224961 no were not having a housing slowdown really the suburban expansion which has had a nice run for 60 years and through which weve squandered much of our post wwii wealth has topped out its pretty much downhill from here and when you think about the relationship between suburbia the american economy and way of life thats going to hurt
3224962 no were really not about to have a recession what youre seeing is just one of the first waves of the collapse of the financial system but really what else would you expect after 30 years of divergence between the paper debt based economy and the worlds ability to back it with hard assets and resources now were faced with the fallout of a combination of consumer and national debt years of growing trade deficits underfunded government obligations retirement system collapse and a massive derivative implosion if you think subprime and collateralized debt obligations was fun just wait until the 50 trillion credit default swap mess gets going
3224963 the average person is going to get waylaid by the combined freight trains of deflation from the credit and housing bust and inflation from skyrocketing commodity prices but dont worry as you wont feel the pinch of inflation if you dont plan on eating driving keeping your home warm or watching american idol but well do our best to inject so much funny money into the system that if you did manage to save a buck id advise you go ahead and spend it today since it will be worth much less tomorrow
3224964 even if we opened up the entire continental shelf quickly invented the seismic equipment had a growing fleet of newer offshore rigs to drill these deep offshore wells discovered two new north seas then maybe we could spend 500 billion and maybe end up 10 years from now with 6 million barrels per day of fresh supply trouble is we have none of those things and 10 15 years from now our 73 million barrels per day of current crude production could easily be down to 50 or 45 based on depletion rates of existing fields even if you had another 6 million barrels per day youll have much less than you have today

3225052 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3225053 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3225054 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3225055 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3225056 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3225095 we believe the business model employed by bendigo and adelaide bank is strong and unique
3225096 our non negotiable focus on customers communities and partners and a strategic focus on growth at profitable prices means we are able to create value throughout the business cycle
3225097 we remain predominantly funded by retail deposits our credit quality remains sound and our prospects for growth remain solid
3225098 the bendigo bank retail network continues to expand by around 25 branches each year and with a high proportion of branches yet to reach maturity future income growth is to some extent locked in
3225099 we are also taking the opportunity afforded by the current disruption to wholesale markets to reshape those businesses for growth and improved margins once funding begins to flow again
3225100 the current market conditions demonstrate the strength and flexibility of the merged bank
3225101 while current conditions have challenged our wholesale businesses we have been able to leverage the strength of our retail franchise to sustain our momentum
3225102 equally as conditions improve for our wholesale businesses they will be well placed to ride the upswing

3225123 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3225124 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3225125 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3225126 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3225127 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3225128 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3225129 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3225130 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3225131 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3225139 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3225140 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3225141 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3225142 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3225143 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3225144 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3225145 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3225146 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3225147 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3225148 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3225149 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3225150 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3225151 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3225152 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3225153 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3225154 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3225155 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3225156 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3225157 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3225158 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3225160 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3225161 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3225162 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3225163 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3225164 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3225165 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3225166 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3225167 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3225168 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3225169 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3225170 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3225171 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3225172 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3225173 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3225174 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3225175 bush to russia back off georgia well see how much impact this has
3225176 i find the charges of russian imperialism a bit tired coming from people who have insisted for years that invading other countries toppling their governments and setting up puppet states is not imperialism
3225177 i dont know what to do about georgia in case youre curious its complicated
3225178 i do not know why the other reporters were not moved
3225179 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3225180 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3225181 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3225182 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3225183 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3225184 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3225185 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3225186 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3225187 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3225188 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3225189 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3225190 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3225191 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3225192 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3225193 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3225194 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3225195 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3225196 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3225197 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3225198 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3225199 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3225200 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3225201 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3225202 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3225203 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3225204 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3225215 then i changed i said you know what thats ridiculous this is the olympics im here for these guys im here for the united states of america its more than i dont care how bad it hurts or whatever im just going to go out there and hit it

3225280 taxpayers or union bosses find out who wants control of gr schools
3225281 this school board has only so much to work with and it is coming under intense pressure
3225282 he and i have been talking about what is happening in grand rapids and morris volunteered his time and talent to lend a hand
3225283 the poor grand rapids school district is trying to educate kids
3225284 brave citizens who are finally standing up to the teachers unions in grand rapids the good guys are standing up for the kids
3225285 threatening to strike to rake in taxpayer dollars for bloated insurance premiums
3225286 eags style is to pass off inaccuracies and supposition as fact
3225287 this latest piece by kyle olson is no exception he has never contacted us for any information about what has really been going on in grand rapids
3225288 our boards idea of education is creating a policy that allows children to graduate without attending classes if mr olson and mr morris are going to continue to attack gr residents maybe they should be present in gr more than they are absent it might help them get their facts straight
3225289 no idea why dick morris would be interested in grand rapids

3225298 they put out this ad and were running this ad and were talking about it which from their point of view actually works for them
3225299 they work and they always work and we always go through this little dance when everybody says im a different kind of politician im post partisan im a maverick and of course when it comes right down to it you need to drive the other guys numbers down if anything they havent gone negative enough just yet
3225300 do you think the frivolous jeering tone of your campaign matches the problems being faced by this country and the sacrifices being made right now by our soldiers overseas
3225301 as many have noted the ad uses hyperbole still however it raises the question is michelle obama a woman

3225348 i hid in leons closet for a couple of years trying to figure out how to make a living in the music business
3225349 leon and i wrote a bunch of songs together i think the stuff we did took off because we werent trying to write pop music just doing stuff we liked
3225350 a lot of different artists will be on the cd like will owen gage who plays lead guitar with me on a track called homesick soldier
3225351 people think youre dead if you arent performing the music scene has always been in my head
3225352 i lived life backwards i had a dream to make records and live off of the royalties the rest of my life and i almost did but i had a new calling so i went back to school and learned to help others

3225367 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3225368 i dont care if theres a frickin corpse down there under the table now
3225369 love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies
3225370 if i could put it simply i would say that i believe theres a force of love and logic in the world a force of love and logic behind the universe
3225371 this of course is at the heart of the idea of redemption to begin again this is at the heart of religious fundamentalism too to be born again i wish to begin again on a daily basis to be born again every day is something that i try to do and im deadly serious about that
3225372 but with christ we have access in a one to one relationship for as in the old testament it was more one of worship and awe a vertical relationship the new testament on the other hand we look across at a jesus who looks familiar horizontal the combination is what makes the cross
3225373 its a mind blowing concept that the god who created the universe might be looking for company a real relationship with people but the thing that keeps me on my knees is the difference between grace and karma you see at the center of all religions is the idea of karma you know what you put out comes back to you an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth or in physics in physical laws every action is met by an equal or an opposite one its clear to me that karma is at the very heart of the universe im absolutely sure of it and yet along comes this idea called grace to upend all that as you reap so will you sow stuff grace defies reason and logic love interrupts if you like the consequences of your actions which in my case is very good news indeed because ive done a lot of stupid stuff
3225374 id be in big trouble if karma was going to finally be my judge id be in deep it doesnt excuse my mistakes but im holding out for grace im holding out that jesus took my sins onto the cross because i know who i am and i hope i dont have to depend on my own religiosity
3225375 shaking out his right arm as he turns away from a hitter hes just struck out shrugging his right shoulder as if to say phew felt that one a little bit but not too much while the guns still blinking 96

3225388 i was hoping for a minimal crowd and a minimal disturbance to traffic
3225389 flitcraft had been a good citizen and a good husband and father not by any outer compulsion but simply because he was a man who was most comfortable in step with his surroundings he had been raised that way the people he knew were like that the life he knew was a clear orderly sane responsible affair now a falling beam had shown him that life was fundamentally none of these things he the good citizen husband father could be wiped out between office and restaurant by the accident of a falling beam he knew then that men died at haphazard like that and live only while blind chance spared them it was not primarily the injustice of it that disturbed him he accepted that after the first shock what disturbed him was the discovery that in sensibly ordering his affairs he had got out of step and not into step with life he said he knew before he had gone twenty feet from the fallen beam that he would never know peace again until he had adjusted himself to this new glimpse of life by the time he had eaten his luncheon he had found his means of adjustment life could be ended for him at random by a falling beam he would change his life a random by simply going away he loved his family he said as much as he supposed was usual but he knew he was leaving them adequately provided for and his love for them was not of the sort to make absence painful

3225406 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
3225407 for the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life and those who find it are few
3225408 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you
3225409 therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of god

3225415 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3225416 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3225417 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3225418 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3225419 resistance in rallies is at 4654 4670 which if sustained then one can expect an upward march to 4722 in an optimistic scenario crucial support is at 4542 4558 which if breached can lead to some more profit booking traders should keep on taking profits as the odds have become even for the new buyers hence they should keep strict trailing stop loss

3225480 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3225481 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3225482 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3225483 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3225484 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3225485 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3225486 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3225487 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3225488 the atps tennis anti corruption program is clear that gambling on any form of tennis match is prohibited

3225490 whats happening to the dollar has to do with a shift inrelative growth and interest rate expectations

3225495 the department previously did random audits where they could if they wanted to cross check census figures with enrollment documentation

3225497 checking with some of the other executive directors we cannot recall this approach before so while i say its a new approach its not one that we oppose

3225500 they and we also recognise this is not the only aspect that is influencing the way in which public hospitals are operating
3225501 what we have agreed is yes there may be some impact in public hospitals but certainly our sense is that its likely to be modest
3225502 this is one of the aspects that is changing in a system that is also changing and certainly we have seen no evidence that there is a major problem
3225503 one of its absurdities in fact is that it does cut out at 100 000 and 150 000

3225527 an ivf cycle produces a number of embryos those that arent immediately transferred back to the patient and that are of good enough quality are cooled slowly to the temperature of liquid nitrogen 196c and stored until needed
3225528 conventional slow freezing creates ice crystals which can damage the embryo as it is thawed
3225529 vitrification differs from traditional cooling and storing techniques in that it allows instantaneous glass like solidification of eggs and embryos without the formation of ice crystals
3225530 since no ice crystals form a much greater percentage of embryos survive thawing following vitrification

3225568 i have to poop really bad ill be right back
3225569 but what did you do with the dollars did you keep them are you going to wash them off later and put them back in regular rotation

3225579 and what are you doing back here why not just stay in california and let bygones be bygones
3225580 well i thought that id give mike one last chance to see his kid
3225581 so im going to let my friend take the baby over to mikes apartment and tell him that if he wants to see his son again he should contact me
3225582 dont you think its a little odd to use your baby as a weapon like that if you and mike were going to work out dont you think you wouldnt need to use a child to that i mean i fucking hate being a pawn in someone elses game and im kind of able to make my own decisions its pretty shitty that youre going to be doing it without him having any sort of a say in it

3225609 what sort of idiot asks a ludicrous question like that
3225610 a wise teachers words spur students to action and emphasize important truths the collected sayings of the wise are like guidance from a shepherd but my child be warned there is no end of books written to hold opinions ready to be expressed studying them can go on forever and become very exhausting here is my final conclusion the bottom line fear god and obey his commands for this is the duty of every person god will judge us for everything we do including every secret thing whether good or bad
3225611 for no one can lay any other foundation than the one we already have jesus christ now anyone who builds on that foundation may use gold silver jewels wood hay or straw but there is going to come a time of testing at the judgment day to see what kind of work each builder has done everyones work will be put through the fire to see whether or not it keeps its value if the work survives the fire that builder will receive a reward but if the work is burned up the builder will suffer great loss the builders themselves will be saved but like someone escaping through a wall of flames

3225617 if christ has not been raised then our preaching is in vain
3225618 it pleased god through the folly of preaching to save those who believe

3225624 the production sharing agreement governing the project does not reference ifc requirements

3225627 lgt group aims to reinforce and accelerate its international growth strategy going forward this strategy was launched approximately ten years ago and involves reducing lgts dependence on the domestic market and diversifying its earnings base
3225628 in line with a fundamental business policy decision taken at the beginning of 2008 lgts business plan will include additional investments in its local onshore banks in europes german speaking countries and in asia consideration of additional onshore locations in other european countries and a markedly stronger emphasis on developing the institutional asset management business
3225629 the decision also involves scaling down the business with us private clients which has never been actively pursued and has always been of secondary importance for the bank in terms of volume and earnings
3225630 further details about the strategic measures will be communicated in early autumn
3225631 and the illegal disclosure of the data to foreign authorities
3225632 we are an active and a complying member of various international organizations such as the oecd the egmont group the financial action task force fatf and the caribbean financial action task force cfatf
3225633 the financial sector of the netherlands antilles is broadly healthy
3225634 the ec claims it can not intervene on our behalf to correct the above mentioned unjust inclusion on black lists of some eu members because eu members are autonomous in their tax matters
3225635 this statement seems very curious especially when we note that in the case of imposing actions to promote what the eu calls good tax governance the ec does have the authority to act on behalf of the eu members
3225636 why does the argument of autonomy of the individual eu member not apply when the eu takes actions to promote good tax governance on the netherlands antilles
3225637 and why does it apply when the netherlands antilles request the ec not for a favor mind you but to simply correct an error that has been made by some eu members
3225638 the ec must understand that we demand a level playing field that we can not be held to higher standards than is demanded of other oecd member and especially that i must do everything in my power to guard our international financial services industry from further erosion black listing seriously undermines the competitiveness of the netherlands antilles financial services sector and consequently the well being of our people
3225639 the treasury has been progressively tightening the net on offshore accounts for some time and it is now getting to a point that those with money held offshore whether acting rightly or wrongly are likely to feel some heat from hmrc in the near future
3225640 hmrc is using any means possible to get hold of information on offshore accounts whether it be paying for information pressuring private banks to hand over details or teaming up with other tax authorities and information sharing hmrc is determined to gain access to these accounts it is looking increasingly likely that hmrc will consider introducing another facility for those holding untaxed offshore assets particularly in offshore bank accounts to disclose these to hmrc and pay any tax owed
3225641 hmrc clearly see anything involving offshore arrangements as increasing your risk score however if an individual is aware of this they can then set about ensuring any offshore arrangements are fully tax compliant if problems are identified in the robustness of any arrangements they should be disclosed to hmrc at the earliest opportunity as hmrc has stated it will look to prosecute cases that have not been disclosed
3225642 to be clear it is perfectly legitimate for a uk taxpayer to have a bank account outside of the uk at its most basic a uk domiciled and resident citizen may for example have an offshore account simply to facilitate the paying of expenses of a holiday home abroad those individuals should have the same tax liability on interest from money held in a uk as in a foreign bank account and that then should not influence an individuals choice in whether to use an offshore account or not
3225643 the waters are being muddied as to what remains legal and it can be perceived that offshore automatically means tax evasion
3225644 as has been the case in the past the stampede to catch tax evaders is invariably going to catch legitimate account holders in the cross fire having to deal with an hmrc enquiry costs time and money and can be daunting when you are on the receiving end and when you believe you have done nothing wrong hopefully hmrc will keep balancing the need for safeguards for those who are not tax evaders as it pursues missing tax revenues

3225674 ive just really given up on pelosi i used to be a really ardent supporter i was really proud of her because she stood up for operation desert storm but somewhere along the line she had a change of heart i just really dont like the direction shes taking
3225675 i could have gone to many districts across the country and had an easy walk into congress but we are working against somebody who is the queen of the system that represents a two party duopoly that is very damaging to democracy so we are not only going to send one person to congress we are going to defeat the speaker of the house of the democrats we are going to put every congressman on notice that their jobs are now going to be performance based not based on who has the most money for who has the incumbency
3225676 i think this is a perfect example of how it has become about her
3225677 that opportunities are never lost someone will take the ones you miss
3225678 i think by 2012 13 iraqi military and police would be capable of handling the internal situation on their own
3225679 but as for external threats iraq will need to depend on the presence of u s forces especially air and land forces for a longer time
3225680 there must be more internal reforms within the security and military establishments more training and better quality arms and equipment
3225681 i believe if there were faster efforts to properly arm and train the military and police
3225682 they will be ready to operate independent of any u s support within three years
3225683 al qaida is on the run and armed militias have been hit hard
3225684 the initiative is in the hands of the iraqi government
3225685 there is a great deal of progress on the ground that is mostly due to the changed perception of the iraqi people of the insurgency or militias
3225686 the sunnis became sick of the actions of the al qaida and extremist groups and turned against them in the anbar province and other areas and on the other side the shiites could no longer tolerate the terror of iranian backed shiite militias like the mahdi army of muqtada al sadr

3225696 a key logger could have been installed in your computer
3225697 a key reason that brazil has done so well with its agricultural economy is that it has invested heavily and intelligently in front end agricultural research and embrapa has been at the forefront of that effort

3225710 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3225711 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3225712 a recycling of the rubbish of fake classical culture tradition a sacrilegious visual garbage dump and an insult to the spirit of liberty low class sound play thats just noise pollution
3225713 a showcase of the reincarnation of the marxist imperialism the ultimate paragon of an all embracing culture of fascist totalitarianism an encyclopaedia that encompasses total defeat in intellectual spirit
3225714 it was reward enough to get rid of jones i thought putting the saucer back in my school bag i left the cloakroom with a big smile on my face thinking who else can i get rid of
3225715 a story by dennis t baker that needs some work

3225717 youre talking at two or three removes from the real power
3225718 they have to talk to the people who do control this
3225719 there are elements within the establishment in pakistan who do not see things the way we see them
3225720 india knows what is going on afghanistan knows what is going on our allies know what is going on
3225721 the foreign fighter problem in afghanistan and pakistan is growing and we consider non pashtun pakistanis such as elements of formerly kashmiri groups a part of that growing problem
3225722 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right

3225724 a managed float exchange rate system based on supply and demand
3225725 it can generate up to 60 percent of the electrical energy usage of the house and i guess the better question isnt why do we offer it as much as why dont other people offer it
3225726 this is not to say she didnt feeling distress or strong feelings but it didnt represent a new psychiatric disorder
3225727 it is a continuation of her pattern of having anxiety depression reactions to significant stressors
3225728 they are seeing unprecedented demand the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on
3225729 knowingly tolerated and turned a blind eye to an unjustifiable risk and frequency of such mistaken identity arrests
3225730 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed

3225739 well we had a very rough experience in the eswc online qualifier i dont want to get into the details but as everyone knows we were forfeited out of the qualifier while representing the usa in moscow at kode5
3225740 we didnt feel this was fair and after the qualifier we submitted a grievance to the head admin for eswc usa as well as the eswc organizing committee in france last week we were offered a berth and graciously accepted it we feel that eswc made the right decision in this case and are very grateful to both the folks in france as well as those in the us for offering us this opportunity
3225741 it was a big deal and i have a lot of respect for what they went through and what they achieved
3225742 some of the athletes know who they are and what they did
3225743 im 26 and just about know what they did though there are a lot of athletes younger than me who are still getting to know of the huge steps they took
3225744 theyve smith and carlos have been around the penn relays and last years athlete of the year awards so their faces are getting known now
3225745 you dont want to offend people or rile them whether voicing political or social points of view
3225746 as regards the athletes we have a rule 51 where athletes cannot make political religious or commercial propaganda or demonstrations
3225747 they have to respect the countrys laws and there must be none in the stadia or the podium they can express their views in the mixed zone but not propaganda
3225748 they the athletes will have the right to be heard and then we will see what action has to be taken
3225749 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3225750 its out of the way now and im just swimming to have fun
3225751 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3225752 it is not easy for an indian to win an olympic medal let alone a gold because there is no sporting culture in our country i hope this will make sports a way of life in india
3225753 i sincerely hope this win will change the face of olympic sport in india
3225754 in our country olympic sports are not really a priority i hope now they will get more attention
3225755 in my opinion she is the best agency inspector general in the state of florida he wrote in january praising her efforts at combating medicaid fraud and abuse
3225756 her report is one of many that will be considered
3225757 i think it will make them think before signing their names to it said beitsch
3225758 thats not how you want government to operate you want critical independent thinking
3225759 i have faith in secretary benson and how she has handled the department and i support her he said
3225760 linda was real gung ho she was out there and she was willing to get things done
3225761 linda was never afraid to ask the tough questions and i know she ruffled feathers over time
3225762 she was well organized she was very highly thought of when she left
3225763 particularly impressive that linda has quickly become an integral and indispensible part of the agency leadership team while at the same time establishing herself as an inspector general par excellence with the strict independence necessary for her to fulfill this role
3225764 trusted reference for statewide discussions on the subject the recommendations from her report significantly influenced the agencys legislation and operational decisions regarding the rollout of medicaid reform

3225769 saya tak dengar tak tengok baru tiba dari perlis apa katanya
3225770 hai biasa sebut tok guru sekarang dah tak ada dia kata rasulullah pun lantik kroni dia abu bakar umar uthman dan ali itu semua kroni rasulullah
3225771 ooo betul ke dia cakap begitu kak sal tahu tak apa sahaja kata dan perbuatan rasulullah itu adalah wahyu ucapan rasulullah tak boleh dianggap sebagai nafsu dan kehendak dia semata mata rasulullah tak pernah nyanyuk dan tak pernah tersalah cakap
3225772 dan tiadalah yang diucapkannya itu al quran menurut kamahuan hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanya wahyu yang dibawakan kepadanya
3225773 rasulullah tak pilih menantunya dengan alasan dia berkelayakan tetapi rasulullah memilihnya kerana yang rasulullah pilih ialah pilihan allah itu sendiri ucapan baginda bukan berasaskan nafsu kerana kalau mengatakan rasulullah lantik dia sebagai pengganti semata mata kerana dia menantu dan sepupu baginda yang berkelayakan itu namanya mengatakan nabi muhammad saw pilih suku sakat takkanlah rasulullah buat pilihan berasaskan nepotisme begitu yang benarnya rasulullah pilih pengganti kerana dia berkelayakan dan berkelayakan itu nada saya dikeraskan tanda menekan persoalan macam saya kata bukan terbit daripada mulut rasulullah saja saja tapi terbit kerana memang dia dipilih allah
3225774 tak cukup kuat nak dijadikan hujah lebih baiklah dielakkan tak cantik dari segi ilmu siasahnya pun nampak macam bila kena orang lain tak boleh bila kena batang hidung macam boleh alasan macam baik jadikan agama dan rasulullah sebagai hujah tetapi sebenarnya rasulullah melantik penggantinya kerana memang perintah allah berkelayakan di sisi allah tak sama dengan ukuran berkelayakan dari sudut pandang manusia allah firman manusia kehendak jadi elaklah mengundang persepsi salah masyarakat ambillah rasulullah betul betul dari sumber betul melainkan ilmu siasah yang dipegang ialah ilmu siasah bani umaiyyah dan abbasiyyah itu saya tak boleh cakap apa sebab dalam hal siasah yang dijadikan sandaran oleh mereka bukan nabi tapi titah mak bapak muawiyah lantik yazid meskipun yang lebih layak iaitu saidina hasan cucu nabi masih ada
3225775 falsafah orang awam akan marah kerana dia tak mahu berfikir walaupun hatinya meronta ronta kata betul ulul albab akan merenung dan dia akan tahu hujah tersebut salah orang biasa akan lihat begini alah sama saja parti agama ke parti kebangsaan ke parti liberal ke sama dan orang akan putus asa dengan pemimpin mereka akan kata hopeless dah malaysia ni

3225780 but thats just another example of why youd want to use the admin api instead of unsupported functionality
3225781 if a case does not demand creating some datasource on the fly would i not have opted for the easily available admin api for that
3225782 cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces
3225783 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3225784 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3225785 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3225786 it has always been the intent of the church to engage in an open and honest discussion with affirmation leaders to listen to their concerns
3225787 the issues surrounding same gender attraction deserve careful attention not public posturing it appears from affirmations actions today that it has opted for a public rather than a private exchange
3225788 mormons are able to respond to emergencies quickly because they balance closely knit relationships and communication channels with a strong desire to take their religion out of their chapels into the community
3225789 the president of the united states had said that it was a miracle that we were able to get so many people so quickly working together so well
3225790 its still fun and theres still a lot of people that get off on it and you know youre playing to 50 000 people in norway and most of them werent born not when kill em all came out but like when the black albumcame out you know what i mean its like a whole new thing the question mark is i just dont know physically the physical element is just the unknown if we can find a way to deal with that then i think we could stick around for a while
3225791 the road to hell is paved with good intentions but although no one talks about it so is the road to heaven which tells us nothing except that good intentions are a great material for paving metaphorical roads
3225792 its all about the long tail about allowing consumers to see what they want when they want
3225793 jams are hardly complex things but people saw 24 stacked together and thought i have no idea how to deal with this
3225794 the obvious media attention in alaska that will be afforded to its sitting senator campaigning while on trial
3225795 we refuse to continue to allow the state of illinois to orphan our educational system
3225796 the first day sets the tone for the entire year
3225797 if a child misses a day of school that child will miss an opportunity to learn i think children should take advantage of every possible day they can to go to school
3225798 its always the right time but the method of keeping children out of school is one that we are diametrically opposed to
3225799 the funding disparity of course brings not only unequal investment but obviously unequal outcomes
3225800 what i show to the general public is obviously the positive side but i am human and this has been a roller coaster ride this isnt flu this is cancer
3225801 how do i keep focused its been pretty easy actually
3225802 a lot of times you can get to events like this like the olympic games and you can put maybe too much pressure on yourself and ive kind of got an out with cancer in that cancers put things in perspective for me
3225803 theres a lot more to life than the olympic games and i think having learned that lesson really quickly has kind of helped keep this whole thing in perspective for me
3225804 its one of those things that we can relate to each other on no father and son wants to have that but i understand a lot more now and a lot better what he has been going through
3225805 hes the guy that i looked to before i even came down with the diagnosis what he did after he was diagnosed and being treated for it you cant help being inspired by that
3225806 and also to know that i will be cured and i will beat this is a pretty inspiring thought too and its not going to control my life
3225807 they help me through the down days it cancer is on my mind constantly i cant help that thats how its got to be
3225808 but with the support i have the people i have in my corner theyre the ones who help me through it
3225809 i know his shanteaus goal was to swim in the olympic games hes doing that hes excited hes positive were all supporting each other in everything we do
3225810 we have waited patiently for three years with hopes they would come back soon and give us the show we so rightly desired nobody around does it live like these swedes with their vintage influenced jazzy psych jams
3225811 jfks campaign like barack obamas was also about hope and optimism
3225812 the history ive lived through has allowed me to recognize his fabulous leadership when i saw him
3225813 im going to get involved through campus if necessary and do things there one way or another weve got to get him elected
3225814 im working on a committee to elect a female democrat in our district to congress its the first time ive ever done this
3225815 this time were at a point where people have to stand up and be counted you cant just give lip service the times require this
3225816 im seeing people my age in their 60s who have never been involved in politics never been politically active in their lives say that now is the time and barack obama is the person who can lead us out of the mess that were in
3225817 weve had it with the way things are for our children and for our grandchildren we need to win this election
3225818 president bush this is interesting was going to make history he becomes the first sitting u s president to attend the olympics in a foreign country he said hes been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in china people are not allowed to make fun of political leaders
3225819 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
3225820 barack obama now is giving interviews where hes opening up about his life the candidates want to reveal their personal side in a new interview that just came out barack obama said as a kid he cried when he saw the movie born free very nice yeah yeah meanwhile john mccain said as a kid he cried because movies weren t invented yet
3225821 president bush arrived in beijing earlier today again i don t think he really understands the olympics that well like they asked him if he liked the decathlon and he said no he preferred regular coffee
3225822 you are my refuge and my shield i have put my hope in your word away from me you evildoers that i may keep the commands of my god sustain me according to your promise and i will live
3225823 this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased listen to him
3225824 why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first jesus explained that elijah did come as john the baptist to prepare the way for him but he was killed just as jesus would also be killed
3225825 we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received honor and glory from god the father when the voice came to him from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain
3225826 i had no desire to die and felt tempted to say something about his mother
3225827 without a doubt its the great olympic moment ive ever experienced or called head and shoulder above anything and we have done some pretty good things its just one of those rare moments that you get in this business to be a part of something like that
3225828 holy crapnikov that would be a shitty place to crash

3225833 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3225834 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3225835 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3225836 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3225837 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3225838 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3225839 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3225840 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3225841 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3225842 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3225843 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3225844 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3225845 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3225846 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3225847 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3225848 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3225849 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3225850 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3225851 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3225852 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3225853 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3225854 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3225855 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3225856 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3225857 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3225901 we were close to really putting some points on the board
3225902 we just didnt execute as well as we probably could have were going to clean it up watch the film make the corrections and get better next week

3225914 well what if we stay on our sides of the ice burg and let it split if we float toward different directions we can assume that that is what was supposed to happen and if we dont drift too far apart we can enjoy the trip down the river together just with a little more distance than before

3225917 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
3225918 its a very sad moment for everyone wearing red white and blue
3225919 just sad they kind of informed us that it was an isolated event but whenever something that tragic happens your initial feeling is to want to be a little bit more secure wherever you go
3225920 once we got it out of our minds for a little bit we were able to focus and play volleyball
3225921 we had a difficult situation and we tried to tell our players to concentrate on the game
3225922 the tragedy that happened with the bachman family is something that could happen to anybody in the world unfortunately it happened to one of our teammates someone we hold close
3225923 this game was completely dedicated to wiz bachman and her family it was a great win for usa volleyball
3225924 youll have to understand what wiz bachman means to usa volleyball

3225932 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
3225933 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
3225934 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

3225978 the information in each case is being checked and each lead is being followed up but we are still waiting for the golden information that will lead us to her

3225983 i think theyre weeding out the dead wood but unless they get something in return how do you replace that

3225993 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3225999 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3226000 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3226015 memang benar kasus ini pernah diperiksa hingga ke penyidikan namun sebagai rakyat saya merasa kasus ini tidak ditindak lanjuti
3226016 saya baru saja didatangi orang intel mabes polri yang menyuruh berhenti dari kasus ini lho kok bisa ya memang siapa dia menyuruh saya untuk berhenti menegakan keadilan
3226017 kan aneh masa subyek yang sama yaitu ijazah palsu dilaporkan oleh dua orang

3226019 itu kalau memang laporan atut bisa berlanjut tapi secara doktrin hukum jelas tidak akan berlanjut

3226092 we think taxing family grocery bills is a really bad idea
3226093 food prices are so high right now and price increases keep going up theyre really out of the control of grocers

3226096 i saw the opening ceremony on tv not live but the next day it was amazing i mean theyd spent 7 years or so preparing for it so it had to have been really did you see it
3226097 the best part was when they lit the flame i really felt something when i saw that the rest of it was a pretty massive spectacle too but in a kind of north korean way maybe not quite as tight as the north koreans though they all perform as if theyre all totally controlled this was a bit looser round the edges but the fireworks were amazing yeah china youve got to give it to them when it comes to fireworks
3226098 but china its a pretty scary place isnt it i mean that american guy getting stabbed and everything
3226099 and beijings not the place for athletes to be doing their thing with all that smog and pollution
3226100 and did you see how they still hadnt finished one of the stadiums by the time the games started
3226101 yeah so they had to paint some scenery to look like it so people wouldnt notice they didnt finish all their procuring in time anyway thats what i think happened
3226102 free country usa tri annual race to the end of the race
3226103 like the greatest works of art however perhaps there is no singular way to interpret
3226104 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package
3226105 so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy
3226106 it is taking a little bit longer than originally expected
3226107 he told me to forget about it and there was nothing i could do about it at that moment
3226108 how many of us went through little league where our parents were our coaches
3226109 but not all of us had parents who were olympic athletes or collegiate athletes more than anything having a parent who knows what it takes to get to that level is really valuable
3226110 you cannot do this without huge love for the sport
3226111 it was going so well not having to be a parent and coach you dont want to mess up your child you dont want to do something to shatter their dreams
3226112 it meant a lot to both of us that she did what she did at worlds the partnership was working
3226113 to see his son succeed and be an olympian is something else

3226118 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3226119 al qaida has a significantly reduced capacity and we have to make sure they are not able to reestablish themselves and regenerate inside of iraq
3226120 have to make sure we dont have outside influence inside of iraq trying to gain advantages and have some sort of leverage over the government of iraq
3226121 and we have to make sure that shia extremists dont try to create increased violence in order to weaken the government of iraq
3226122 those are the dangers those are things we have to watch for very carefully
3226123 we do not want the hezbollah model inside of iraq
3226124 we do not want an organization that is an alternative to the government
3226125 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3226126 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
3226127 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end
3226128 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
3226129 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
3226130 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that terrorist groups are not eradicated overnight

3226188 in the economic arena all of a sudden you are seeing private investment you see the electricity grid is literally all up for the first time in about three years and oild production is up by some 400 000 barrels i think in the last six months as well in part because of electricit which then means there is more fuel for the electricity

3226202 trip was shrouded in secrecy because of security concerns and revealed only when he had headed home
3226203 ties between the two neighboring countries had been strained since the fall of saddam because of jordanian fears that iraqs shiite led government was too friendly with shiite dominated iran jordanian officials have been concerned about iranian influence in iraq and the loss of discounted oil which saddam once provided
3226204 obama spends so much time courting the rich that im not surprised that james webb has removed himself from consideration for vice president webb is the most articulate senate critic of americas class divide the most important and unfortunately the least debated issue in politics today is our drift toward a class based system the likes of which we have not seen since the 19th century

3226261 i played baseball with him for a season two years ago me and him were just the jokesters of the team just messin around and always having fun always built the team up stuff like that he knew a lot of people because he got around he walks around all the time hes just a really really nice kid
3226262 sometimes theres rumors that go around we kind of like to stop the rumors and focus on the facts and focus on the positive things that we remember about a person and the fun things we used to do rather than focus on the negative there can be why there can be anger that comes out at the person who may have been involved in the situation or what if only i would have done this or what if only i would have done that
3226263 2008 but releases throughout the rest of the world are located in february 2009
3226264 i am increasingly struck by the similarity of the agw debate to the struggle between the church of rome and the protestant dissenters in the 16th century and afterwards
3226265 my skeptical protestant mind begins to object as soon as i hear anyone talk like this no matter how many years they have worked in a field no matter how many peer reviewed papers they have published no matter what their title they are claiming authority i dont accept it
3226266 as his primary source on climate science aitkin directs readers to a paper published by the heartland institute
3226267 the ipccs voluminous papers are available at its website while a skeptical scientific response nature not human activity rules the climate published by the non governmental international panel on climate change can be downloaded from http sepp org publications nipcc feb 2020 pdf the best place to start to come to terms with the debate is a new zealand website whose organisers come from the university of canterbury at christchurch their site attempts to give a balanced perspective but it does list all the most active websites on both sides of the issue
3226268 i am not suggesting and have no reason to believe that don aitkin has taken any money from exxon or any other company or group
3226269 that increased carbon dioxide has been responsible as well for all or the major part of any warming that has occurred has not been demonstrated by anyone least of all by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc it has been modelled conjectured argued asserted and proclaimed but it has not been shown to be true
3226270 is the planet warming to a degree dangerous to us and other life
3226271 if the ph of the oceans dropped substantially they would first become freshwater
3226272 i am increasingly struck by the similarity of the agw debate to the struggle between the church of rome and the protestant dissenters in the 16th century and afterwards the church claimed the right to mediate between the believer and god while the protestants argued that each of us could establish a personal communication with god throughout his talk i could hear someone talking in the tones of received wisdom
3226273 in modern society there will always be matters we cannot grasp
3226274 why isnt clive burning the midnight oil in order write sic lucid articles about how to transition to cheap renewable energy sources
3226275 tough little planet with a biosphere which can cope with this stuff
3226276 no real scientist argues with the issue of unprecedented concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere
3226277 it is well known that the contribution of co2 to temperature is logarithmic and diminishing
3226278 you either study science or engineering but you cant have both
3226279 pcc never said the co2 sensitivity i e the projected temperature rise for each doubling in co2 level was 3 deg c they say 1 5 4 5 deg c
3226280 go away come back when you are demonstrably far far more on top of your subject
3226281 and as soon as you again quote just one your shitty little agw fatwa blogs you lose
3226282 how you could pay anyone less than the minimum wage in good conscience
3226283 raising the federal minimum wage would have little impact on their labor costs
3226284 were going to have to win a lot of games
3226285 china at least certainly leads the world in something the capacity to hide the dirt with glitter and gold
3226286 its a well known trouble spot over the years and made more so by the gale force winds weve seen since all day yesterday and the high spring tides
3226287 its ok saying they shouldnt have gone in the water but after all it was their three children who were being swept out
3226288 the fathers were just clinging onto each other and shouting for help themselves
3226289 my guess and analysis shows that less than 3 out of 10 games recover their development and marketing costs with boxed goods sales
3226290 so whats going to have to happen creative use of hybrid online and offline advertising revenues online offline transactions with consumers these business models must be explored
3226291 saya berdoa jika suatu saat laskar pelangi difilmkan yang menggarapnya adalah dua orang keriting itu mira lesmana dan riri riza
3226292 laskar pelangi pernah akan dibuat sinetron ftv dan akan dibeli dengan harga yang sangat fantastik untuk dibuat e book dll saya tidak pernah tertarik
3226293 semakin kuat keyakinan saya bahwa riri dan mira adalah orang yang tepat karena mereka membaca laskar pelangi dengan cara yang berbeda dengan orang lain

3226308 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3226309 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3226310 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3226311 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3226312 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3226313 perhaps if he had taken a look around once in a while at all the good people who were helping him up he might have realized that he didnt get where he was all alone then perhaps he wouldnt have felt so much like superman
3226314 a resident in the south blount utility district said they got a notice of violation of safe drinking water standards indicating their drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead
3226315 it was a touching moment and a lovely display of republican family values cindy blushed of course and looked flattered you could almost see her already measuring the thongs she will wear in the white house
3226316 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldnt readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
3226317 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
3226318 taking a stand against chinas big redemptive pr show by declining to attend wouldve been consistent and coherent but complaining all the way to the show and even at his reception in china this morning smacks of incoherency bad manners and outright hypocrisy

3226330 if this is the chairmans take on the craziest sh t to come down the pipe since oh i dont know a member of the tndp executive committee accused the democratic presidential nominee of ties to terrorism it will be very revealing indeed when mr
3226331 thank heavens the white kids in nashvilles public schools are doing so well academically if they werent our schools would look much worse
3226332 the piece discusses the increased interest in bicycling that has accompanied higher gasoline prices i have noticed more people riding on the roads this summer unfortunately a few of them appear to have not yet mastered safety rules on riding with traffic
3226333 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
3226334 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
3226335 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution
3226336 also please ask whomever is your choice for president why he bought 5 6 million dollars in advertising during the olympics knowing what china is doing in darfur tibet berma and other human and animal rights violations
3226337 of course the malkin tents are going to claim another victory but hey look at it this way we liberals can snicker at them for defending a holiday with communist socialist origins founded by the evil labor unions
3226338 here in nashville i saw 3 69 at a pilot station earlier this week thats a 40 cent drop from the high of 4 09 gallon back in july funny none of the stories about that republican kabuki theater on offshore oil drilling bothers to mention that
3226339 forty five percent of volunteering in tennessean is performed in the religious sector whereas that number is 63 in utah are tennesseans heathens or is that just a mormon thing
3226340 this this i believe explains the virulent anti mexican sentiment here in the south
3226341 the past is not dead in fact its not even past
3226342 id hate to be an incumbent republican in two years its going to be a bloodbath
3226343 the whole world loves barack obama hes really popular thats why we shouldnt vote for obama

3226348 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3226349 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3226350 therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it
3226351 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
3226352 as a necessity to ones eternal salvation the damnable heresy that a believer can lose salvation is nothing less than a form of lordship salvation whereas the
3226353 just because we are saved by faith without works does not give us a
3226354 but if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sins and does the same detestable things the wicked man does will he live
3226355 will he live if he departs from his righteous ways
3226356 none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered
3226357 when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered in his own righteousness
3226358 to claim that a believer can lose salvation is to say that one who is a new creature i

3226360 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3226361 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3226362 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3226363 though this is a new technique for the uk early results and publications in japan and the usa have been extremely encouraging
3226364 the first published study on babies born from vitrification shows no adverse effects of the technique and there are no implications to evies health as a result of the vitrification process
3226365 im delighted we have been able to help ian and rebecca
3226366 an ivf cycle produces a number of embryos those that arent immediately transferred back to the patient and that are of good enough quality are cooled slowly to the temperature of liquid nitrogen 196c and stored until needed
3226367 conventional slow freezing creates ice crystals which can damage the embryo as it is thawed
3226368 vitrification differs from traditional cooling and storing techniques in that it allows instantaneous glass like solidification of eggs and embryos without the formation of ice crystals
3226369 since no ice crystals form a much greater percentage of embryos survive thawing following vitrification

3226377 our house is littered with things that dont work too well but i wanted them anyway
3226378 an advisory service for baby boomers and others seeking a lifestyle that includes golf
3226379 over the hill tag for people of my age but it is true to say we are over the half way mark on lifes journey therefore its time to pick up speed
3226380 why would someone who is supposed to be a golf travel expert himself use a golf tour company
3226381 it is all part of the design and the whole macbook looks really good
3226382 despite the high cost of living it remains very popular
3226383 as an older golfer myself i was looking around the golf media and there wasnt anything specifically covering this area
3226384 sure as older golfers we are still very interested in what tiger woods and the top australian golfers are up to but we are also increasingly interested in golf lifestyle issues such as travel health and fitness and maybe things such as how to keep your swing going as you start losing some flexibility or at least learning how not to care so much
3226385 i also wanted to provide a central point for information and resources for areas such as veteran golf events and organisations and to highlight the senior golf circuit here and overseas
3226386 i am hoping that in some small way australian senior golfer can help build the fraternity of older golfers locally nationally and internationally and the senior golf exchange is a concept that does that in a very meaningful way
3226387 we will certainly be doing our best to help senior golf exchange spread the word on what it has to offer
3226388 despite the high cost of living it remains very popular
3226389 at least give me a chance to fail before marginalizing me
3226390 he used to say to me kid im going to get you a gig at royce hall if it kills me
3226391 i can literally say i owe my life to bernie not a career my life
3226392 knowingly tolerated and turned a blind eye to an unjustifiable risk and frequency of such mistaken identity arrests
3226393 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed
3226394 i kept telling myself that after they took my fingerprints they would find out right away but they didnt
3226395 i thought they had the perfect system but sometimes things go wrong
3226396 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3226397 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3226398 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3226399 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
3226400 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
3226401 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
3226402 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
3226403 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out
3226404 were always hoping to identify who does these kinds of things so we can get a feel for whats behind it
3226405 its always a concern and we take it seriously but in the context of other things when theres murders going on in town those have to take precedence
3226406 this was an extremely difficult decision since it affects the lives of team members and their families
3226407 however some of the flood damage in the plant was extensive and after a thorough analysis we determined it is simply not feasible to put in new equipment
3226408 we appreciate the efforts of our team members to clean up the plant and make it operational again
3226409 while the plant will not return to previous production levels we intend to make sure our remaining operations run as effectively as possible
3226410 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3226411 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3226412 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3226413 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3226414 in the area where were standing right now there was about a five foot washout where it took the total road out
3226415 the big thing it was so devastating when it first happened and now its sort of hard to visualize how bad it was
3226416 weve got most of the roadways open to traffic now a lot of them have gravel in the area but thats what our crews are doing now going in and patching the asphalt surfaces
3226417 it was a little inconvenience because we had to come in the back way off kessler
3226418 we couldnt come in off of 113 so coming from town and stuff it was a little inconvenient because we had to go out of our way to go places
3226419 the biggest thing weve got to do now after we get our patching done is going back and touching up the shoulders and working on grading out the topsoil
3226420 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3226421 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3226422 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3226423 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3226424 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3226425 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3226426 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3226427 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3226428 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3226429 isaac hayes will forever be known as a gifted musical genius an oscar and grammy award winning artist with his own star on the hollywood walk of fame we have all been anticipating how exciting it was going to be to have him be part of this classic
3226430 now the planned tribute has even greater meaning as throngs of attendees will also be coming to pay their respects to mr hayes life and legacy
3226431 this is of course tragic news about the loss of such a giant in the music business stax records was in many ways the house that isaac built as a prolific songwriter and performer and i cant think of a more fitting way to show our gratitude for everything he gave us than to fill the l a coliseum with all of his fans
3226432 except for those statements regarding your clients involvement if any in the murder of amos mortier
3226433 coming back 50 minutes after his last race is incredible
3226434 i just swam my own race we trying to go 1 2 the whole time
3226435 i have vague memories of watching battle of the planets when i was a kid too and i cant tell the difference between the two properties
3226436 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3226437 i remember our portugal ec two years back we started slowly and lacklustre there too and won but we will have to up our game against japan big time thats one thing thats clear
3226438 i want the recovery time to be maximal this group is so eager and hungry on the training but the batteries are dead too early in the match
3226439 my biggest problem with this team is that most lads arent capable of looking beyond their own performance
3226440 its not that they dont want to because they give it their all but they cant find the solutions on the pitch i told drenthe many times to stay deep and keep the pitch long but he keeps on dropping back to pick up the ball and trying to force a solution with the ball on the foot no wonder he isnt able to finish the game and hes not the only one
3226441 i have money to spend my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing on your buy is also important i do not know yet if it will be the swiss or somebody else
3226442 que se fije en l ericsson para la selecci n
3226443 it went much better than yesterday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that
3226444 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3226445 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3226446 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3226447 we passed a home with some asians were out front and they were very friendly and waving and you can tell that their house was severely damaged
3226448 this reynosos statement was supposed to have happened in 2006 they come up here two weeks before the election i think most of it is politically motivated its the definition of dirty politics but if this gentleman that made this allegation will come bring me a signed document then i will definitely have it investigated and i will deal with it accordingly
3226449 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3226450 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3226451 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3226452 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3226453 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3226454 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3226455 i had two blood clots that were in there varicose veins usually dont bother you but the fact that i had a blood clot in me it flared up real quick thats really why we had to go in so soon and get it done the clots were not letting the blood flow through my leg and of course the swelling was from that thats why we had to get it taken care of so quick
3226456 its one of those things where if i could be out there today i would be out there today
3226457 but you dont want to come back too fast because then it could sideline you for even a couple more weeks the plan is to do what the doctors say the timeline right now is two weeks
3226458 tony has proven through his commitment to his education and athletics that he will be a strong leader the constituents of legislative district 6 can count on
3226459 tonys strong faith and belief in god will help guide him as he represents his district his neighbors can be sure he will represent them with honor and dedication
3226460 catching the wrong john why are the media talking about john edwards infidelity if they arent going to talk about john mccains
3226461 its a lot easier to judge than to withhold judgment
3226462 hes taking a bubble bath hes taking a bubble bath come quick hes taking a bubble bath
3226463 it wouldve been funnier if you left the mask on

3226467 we have been taught that even if we screw up in life to hide it
3226468 stunned viewers thought they were watching the string of fireworks filmed from above by a helicopter
3226469 but in reality they were watching a 3 d graphics sequence that took almost a year to produce
3226470 id like to buy all these buffy dolls and play with them ill have time on my hands soon ive almost finished the led zeppelin book im at the nice and big stage
3226471 i go through the text making sure i havent used any long words if i find any fancy adjectives have crept in i replace them with small words like nice and big ive liked these words ever since i was told not to use them in english class at school after that i check that the sentences are short so as people wont get confused and i shorten all the chapters so they wont get bored i cant read anything complicated these days my attention span is too short everyone else probably feels the same
3226472 i got with the guys and said were not a 4 by 100 team
3226473 the centre recently cleared appointment of six new directors on our board we are holding discussions relating to the ipo with our issue managers the issue is expected to open in october most preferably in the third week of october
3226474 as on date we are decided to go ahead with the issue
3226475 we see a significant demand growth in this segment the government plans to achieve a tele density of 32 74 per cent by 2010 from 15 6 per cent now with improved coverage of rural areas india will need additional 1 5 lakh towers in the next three years from the current base of 1 20 lakh towers to meet the capacity and coverage requirements
3226476 in the past 18 months we have set up a new sourcing office in bangalore which would make apparel specifically for sale in india going forward 70 per cent of the volumes of what we sell at our stores will be made in india
3226477 this opens up opportunities for the division heavy engineering division as it has been a development partner of drdo
3226478 quite honestly we have always assumed that gay for pay is really just a marketing ploy to sell the straight fantasy to gullible consumers the vast majority of the performers being billed as gay for pay are actually bisexual or gay half the models being portrayed and marketed as straight are as queer as a 3 bill
3226479 ive yet to run into a gay for pay model we do hear from a lot of young straight guys but they are only interested in solo work im aware of some well known gay porn performers who are supposedly straight in my own experience though i havent met any
3226480 99 percent of the models i employ are gay for pay the gay for pay guys work really hard and they are always turned on and ready to go when the cameras start to roll
3226481 they are all secretly bi and its their chance to have sex with a guy
3226482 when i was a performer i always requested to fuck or get fucked by the gay for pay guys then always hooked up with them off camera
3226483 the past city commission did it wrong this city commission can make it right
3226484 were going to get there with a solution that is going to be in the best interest of the city in my mind and fair and just for mrs hoff that is me speaking from my hear and my firm belief
3226485 i think that having open legal cases against the city has prevented you as commissioners probably from doing some things that you really should have done in the past
3226486 we need our community health back and i plead with you please open the door and have a discussion
3226487 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
3226488 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
3226489 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
3226490 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
3226491 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
3226492 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
3226493 twenty seven librarians ran into difficulty trying to get visas for an international conference in quebec city and 13 of them were refused the president of the international federation of library associations said yesterday
3226494 we had very few refused when we had our conference in boston in 2001
3226495 this is really very strange and i cant understand it at all this is a very high number
3226496 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3226497 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3226503 were extremely challenged by this new economic reality to say the least
3226504 were all doing this overflow thing now to try to house families in the shelters as opposed to putting so many people in the drake hotel
3226505 theres no affordable housing ive been looking for a job for six months
3226506 the thing with poverty is that even if people are working one minor setback can send a whole family into a tailspin
3226507 if we can get through this economic time when we come out the other side i believe the changes will show great results
3226508 this is such an amazing opportunity were proposing to restore a gateway to minneapolis
3226509 i had my 20 year old get drunk every night period
3226510 were going to dig anyway because your neighbor wants it

3226513 what if superman had been raised in the soviet union
3226514 the stories we are exposed to shape our identity and view of the world of what is good and evil even
3226515 well lots of graffiti beer drinking drug use and ive observed it many times and called public officials to do something about it nothing has been done
3226516 with all the unruliness comes vandalism come possibly burglary and people could get hurt up here you just got to bite the bullet and do the work
3226517 we dont do a thing we cant take the paint off theres no paint thats going to match every tree is different theyre weathered take a look around panorama park is the one thats bad for painting the trees and thats a shame
3226518 well i dont know how much worse it can get its pretty bad as it is like i said when theres a shortage of staff its quite a challenge keeping up with it the parks department right now were running on a skeleton crew but were putting forth the effort to get the job done
3226519 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl

3226527 abortion precedes every other social issue or group of issues
3226528 every other social issue is to say that the right to life is the fundamental moral principle by which catholics approach every moral issue it is the
3226529 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3226530 this is going to be a big pickup for those charities
3226531 our forecast shows that in the first year they should actually see 50 000 profit per charity
3226532 we looked at our funding base and felt this would offer us an opportunity to diversify our funding so we dont rely on one entity or one grant
3226533 will our donations potentially be down next year sure they will when people are paying four dollars a gallon for gasoline

3226543 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country
3226544 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats
3226545 completed a significant part of the operations to oblige georgia the georgian authorities to restore peace to south ossetia
3226546 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
3226547 a significant part of the operation to force the georgian authorities to make peace in south ossetia has been concluded tskhinvali is under the control of a reinforced russian peacekeeping contingent
3226548 we are not crossing the de facto border thats our key principle russian peacekeeping troops have received no orders to invade georgian territory
3226549 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3226550 he is seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia

3226571 restaurants are pretty good at supplementing ingredients like replacing a side of rice with pasta

3226585 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
3226586 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3226587 people who are saying president musharraf will resign they are either lying or they simply dont know his nature
3226588 president musharraf is a man of character and no one can point a finger at him he has a clean track record
3226589 why wait for the niceties perhaps the tv anchors should don their hoods and use the zardari and zawahiri indictments to drag the president and hang him to the nearest tree
3226590 the very things that got it the ppp and also nawaz sharif so many votes are the very things that it is disincentivized from moving on it does not want to restore the judges it really does not want to impeach musharraf because it made deals with musharraf and the national reconciliation order of course is the basis that absolves zardari from so much from the alleged and probably likely wrongdoing
3226591 the army is in kind of a pickle it does not want to defend musharraf
3226592 but it also does not want its institutional equity to be drug dragged through the mud when it is already down and out so i seriously doubt that they are the government going to get the numbers for an impeachment and i think that that is probably going to be communicated to them the government one way or the other and i think the army is going to be pretty active in subverting an impeachment
3226593 president musharraf has made it clear that he has no plans to leave pakistan whether he stays in power or not they have apparently agreed to help assure a secure and honourable stay for him in pakistan
3226594 they also want to ensure that the president should be given full indemnity should he agree to step down this is more or less what the pakistan army also wants
3226595 the president to quit while sane and temperate advice is indeed that of abdication this sort of vindictive hype may be counter productive by challenging him to dig in his heels and weather the storm is that the right way to go about exercising the constitutional right to impeach the president
3226596 the proliferation of narcotics rising indian influence in afghanistan maltreatment of dr aq khan and the killing of the madrassa seminarians at lal masjid

3226599 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3226600 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3226601 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3226602 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3226603 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3226604 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3226605 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3226606 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3226607 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
3226608 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3226609 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
3226610 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3226611 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3226612 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3226613 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3226614 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function

3226616 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3226617 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3226618 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3226619 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went

3226622 al qaeda has a significantly reduced capacity and we have to make sure they are not able to re establish themselves and regenerate inside of iraq
3226623 and we have to make sure that shia extremists dont try to create increased violence in order to weaken the government of iraq
3226624 those are the dangers those are things we have to watch for very carefully
3226625 we do not want the hezbollah model inside of iraq

3226668 how come sun and openoffice org arent directly involved in this microsoft free pc effort is openoffice org assisting the effort at all
3226669 well yes theyre all using our software the openoffice org community maintains the openoffice org software assisted by generous sponsorship from sun ibm novell redflag red hat etc several of these companies then use the software as a base for their own products suns staroffice ibms symphony redflags redoffice canonical red hat and novell will now have distributions both with openoffice org and with ibms symphony that provides choice to their customers as they can choose which flavour of software suits them best the really good news is that both software packages use the iso approved opendocument format to store their documents so people can happily swap backwards and forwards between openoffice org and symphony without losing any data formatting etc the significant difference between openoffice org and ms office is microsofts marketing budget ibm also have considerable marketing budgets so hopefully this will help to redress the balance
3226670 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3226671 in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3226672 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tbilisi
3226673 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3226674 saakashvili says the russians are bent on regime change in very emotional language he claimed the russians were engaged in ethnic cleansing

3226885 we will mount the rlv prototype on a sounding rocket s9 the rocket will speed it up to mach 5 before the body is allowed to surf and suck air for onboard combustion this process fires the scramjet and propels the payload to the desired orbit at speeds between mach 8 and 10
3226886 were in an advanced stage the shock tunnel test will soon be conducted our plan is to have a 400 second flight by 2009 says m s sundareshan technical adviser at the defence research and development laboratory hyderabad the drdl is currently firing its test engine in a ground facility
3226887 the initial results are promising we achieved significant thrust value
3226888 the hyperplane can fly in at fast speeds fire the missile or launch the warhead and return the reusability will reduce our costs significantly
3226889 the cost of launching a satellite using conventional rockets like the pslv or gslv is 25 000 to 28 000 per kg the scramjet can reduce it to 500 this will make any nation with such a technology a launch destination
3226890 the conventional rocket is expendable each stage burns out as the payload soars but the rlv will come back after its mission
3226891 weve a few uav projects going where this technology is being experimented with it can be integrated with the hstd
3226892 were talking about a craft that moves at great speeds breaks off from the atmosphere and re enters weathering high temperatures and atmospheric friction there are several new alloys being developed apart from their use in scramjet vehicles this research will impact the whole gamut of strategic metallurgy
3226893 in a way its a blessing in disguise whoever proves it first will attract global attention with the country inching closer to the concept of aerospace strategic forces there will be a lot of give and take once the technology is proved indigenously

3226955 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3226956 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3226957 information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the united states

3226960 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3226963 weve had just a great time going to softball games going swimming volleyball games and just really a relaxing summer
3226964 i think its really important for teachers to regroup and to rest during the summer so that theyre ready for that school year again to give their best to the kids
3226965 usually the first week of school is exciting with the kids and all the new things but its still kind of a struggle to get your brain off summer vacation and back into working with kids and devoting all that attention to them
3226966 what i like about working at the bank is the fact that i get a little bit of a business background so if i want to go further into maybe a masters in administration being a principal or if someday i want to leave teaching and go into the business i have a little bit of a background there
3226967 and i do love being with the kids all day but i like the adult conversations at the bank and meeting with customers and talking with them too
3226968 i was just on vacation in california with my girlfriends for a weekend getaway and there was stuff in the store that i needed for my classroom so i was shopping thats the first thing i bought was stuff for my classroom versus stuff for myself so i think about the kids all of the time
3226969 we do need the roads and the infrastructure for the future and i agree with you on that this is all about how do we pay for it do we re prioritize the money we have available or are we going to raise taxes to do it
3226970 i believe in doing it i believe in biting the bullet i believe it is necessary for this city to move forward on down the road that we do this
3226971 thats why we have to find a stable funding source we cant just do it one year at a time we need to do it and have the funding source ther so we can continue to be ahead
3226972 the truth of it is if gas prices went up a dollar from 3 to 4 thats about 1 34 a day that would increase for the average americans its not that much its just right in front of us every day thats why people panic
3226973 gas prices are five percent seven percent of their budget the problem is not the five percent its the 95 percent where people arent handling their money well
3226974 if gas prices went up to 6 a gallon we could absorb that now we might have to get rid of cable cell phones get rid of some things
3226975 they go get a 200 car payment and brand new loan because they want to save 40 a month in gas prices
3226976 gas prices are emotional because they are on every corner in this city and every city in america theyre on the news every night the reality is theyre a very small segment of our expenses

3226980 the very things that got it the ppp and also nawaz sharif so many votes are the very things that it is disincentivized from moving on
3226981 it does not want to restore the judges it really does not want to impeach musharraf because it made deals with musharraf and the national reconciliation order of course is the basis that absolves zardari from so much from the alleged and probably likely wrongdoing
3226982 if there were a deal in which zardari got to be president and nawaz got to be prime minister again how would that work you know on one level it sounds like the basis for a concordat
3226983 the army is in kind of a pickle it does not want to defend musharraf
3226984 but it also does not want its institutional equity to be drug dragged through the mud when it is already down and out so i seriously doubt that they are the government going to get the numbers for an impeachment and i think that that is probably going to be communicated to them the government one way or the other and i think the army is going to be pretty active in subverting an impeachment
3226985 i have felt for some time that the army did not want to stick its neck out any more on musharrafs behalf
3226986 and of course musharraf does not control the instruments of government he cannot snap his fingers and have 2 000 people arrested like he used to be able to at what point and with what combination of provocations have things reached a point where the military leadership will say you know what this is not working we are going to have to go back to our old way of doing things

3227014 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis

3227032 the deal is significant because telekom used to be a government monopoly and the union ver di expected support from germanys social democrats the german government still owns about a third of deutsche telekom but during the strike social democratic leaders released only a bland statement saying the two sides should work things out for themselves

3227050 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3227051 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3227052 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3227053 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3227054 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3227055 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3227065 one woman who was asked to be a bridesmaid in her mormon friends wedding found out on the morning of the wedding that she wasnt actually going to be allowed inside the temple because she wasnt mormon
3227066 her job as a bridesmaid was to stand on the front steps of the temple in her full bridesmaids outfit and ask those who showed up are you a believer in the church of latter day saints she had to make sure that non mormons including the brides father who had been excommunicated did not get inside
3227067 was not going to be one of those brides that the bridesmaids could wear whatever we wanted that there would be none of that jessica mcclintock bullshit

3227083 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3227084 im shocked amp saddened hes a brilliantly talented entertainer whom ive admired for a long time its truly our loss
3227085 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3227086 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

3227092 we would anticipate that he would be very strong for us toward the end of the year but a lot remains to be seen
3227093 he hasnt shown any indication of wilting and hes worked to stay strong all summer so thats a good sign
3227094 jose is gaining experience every day and doing a good job now and sometimes young talent without experience outplays veteran talent with experience just with stuff you have to be in tune with that also
3227095 jose doesnt have a lot of experience but his stuff is electric and in every situation hes done a good job
3227096 when i would get into a slump i think i tried too hard to get out of it instead of just trusting my stuff
3227097 that was definitely something i learned last year and it helped out in regaining my form pretty quick after that
3227098 i just tried to keep the ball low find my balance point
3227099 our challenge is every day theres a team out there that can beat you a lineup that can score a lot of runs and a pitcher that can shut you down
3227100 our focus is on our game right now the standings are irrelevant we have a lot of areas that we need to keep moving forward with if were going to be the team that we want to be
3227101 but when youre used to winning that carries over a lot
3227102 these guys come to the park ready to go every day
3227103 you want to focus on things you can control and the only thing thats really in our hands is that game tonight pitch to pitch inning to inning thats where we need to be
3227104 you can think about that you have to just play the game
3227105 nobody is going to say well were winning a lot now were going to lose today because were winning too many games after struggling earlier in the year were just all playing well at the same time and having fun
3227106 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm
3227107 what needs to be done by catholics today for their country
3227108 the answer is dont lie if we say were catholic we need to prove it americas public life needs people willing to stand alone without apologies for the truth of the catholic faith and the common human values it defends p 197
3227109 was essentially a duplicate of my work com guide to learning seo that was also syndicated to business com
3227110 its something that really weve been working on for over 8 years
3227111 i didnt like the agreement in the beginning but the developer actually told me look theyll have the revenue for 2 years
3227112 we dont know exactly how much revenue but it will be significant
3227113 when they changed over and went back to trussville 9 percent sales tax
3227114 different tax bracket so it cost me a little bit more
3227115 yep tata and b like to go to those stores alot mommy
3227116 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
3227117 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
3227118 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
3227119 senator bayh has shown the judgment that we need to admit that mistakes were made and we need to learn from them
3227120 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad
3227121 we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
3227122 he has got hollywood good looks and he speaks well he would be very loyal
3227123 i was talking with him gerrard this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3227124 he is progressing really well but we will check after training
3227125 i will speak with the doctor and with steven and then decide
3227126 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
3227127 they have not played in the group stages of the champions league before so they will be keen to change that also they will have the confidence of champions after winning their title
3227128 liverpool is a massive club and were expected to beat teams so im looking forward to the challenge
3227129 i certainly am ready ask any player and theyll tell you that pre season is just about getting fitness now the real business starts
3227130 whenever liverpool were playing in the champions league or in a game which had no effect on tottenham id be cheering them on the champions league is part of why i wanted to come here this is my opportunity now
3227131 but if he nowak decides to bring me in ill be ready to go and to do everything i can to help the team get the point we need
3227132 we lost two really important players and we were unlucky to concede such a late goal because we had the result in our hands and a win would have put us through without any of this drama
3227133 michael bradley begins all of our attacks and wins the balls and in the middle and freddy well everyone knows he can change a game in one second with one brilliant run or pass
3227134 i cant even describe the feeling of getting to be an olympian
3227135 we know the nigerians are an outstanding team as weve been able to see a few of their games already
3227136 but were over the disappointments of the holland game and weve been playing some good soccer
3227137 what do i expect from my country nothing extraordinary just a few mundane things food good road network kerosene gas and oil for his car security of life and property electricity good and qualitative education at all levels for leaders of tomorrow a good and efficient health care system for the rich and poor alike good mass transportation system for ease of movement around the country provision of the enabling environment for the creation of jobs for the unemployed
3227138 that this was one of my exit strategies back to nigeria to smoothing my way back into a political appointment back home
3227139 the more i read about some ugly stuff about nigeria which sometimes demoralises me the more i receive some inner conviction that i must not be discouraged on nigeria at all i just cant explain why the sense of this ultimate safe landing for nigeria where all her enemies and conquerors will be powerless to continue in their demonic manoeuvrings remains ever strong
3227140 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3227141 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3227142 knowingly tolerated and turned a blind eye to an unjustifiable risk and frequency of such mistaken identity arrests
3227143 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed
3227144 i kept telling myself that after they took my fingerprints they would find out right away but they didnt
3227145 i thought they had the perfect system but sometimes things go wrong

3227149 the best way to predict the future is to invent it
3227150 the people of the niger delta will not be silent until the battle is won internal colonialism will fail how can we drop the issue of resource control that is our life
3227151 mend will never sell its birthright for a bowl of porridge when the impoverished masses in the region continue to live in abject poverty we are not a part of this deal the chanomi creek pipeline and other major pipelines will be destroyed within the next 30 days
3227152 in the educated way of looking at issues you may say that dokubo asari used foul language but in the real sense of the word that is what the north is they are parasites if they say they are not parasites let them call the bluff of the south and go their own way instead of using guns to force others to accept them
3227153 i want to sound it clear that the people of the niger delta have been oppressed depressed and frustrated in this nation it is inhuman that the source of nigerian wealth today is being denied social justice there is poverty death and sufferings in niger delta the issue of the area alone could make god angry with nigeria their wealth is being used against them some leaders in the area have compromised the progress and settlement of the region due to their selfish interest it is time we faced the reality over niger delta crisis i was the leading counsel to ken saro wiwa in 1995 and he told me during the trial at the kangaroo tribunal set up to murder him that he pitied what would happen to his people and nigeria after his death then he told me to walk out on the tribunal in tears i did but today we are all witnesses to what is happening i urge president yaradua never to return violence for violence in the crisis but rather look into the needs of the people the niger delta people deserve our apology in this country nigeria has never been fair to them no not at all it is now a battle that must be committed to god in prayers
3227154 to demonstrate our seriousness to the uks support of an injustice mend will be calling off its unilateral cease fire with effect from midnight saturday july 12 2008
3227155 deceived by a clever but fraudulent presentation of the niger delta unrest when yaradua gave world leaders at the g 8 summit the impression that the shedding of the blood of the people of the niger delta was caused by bunkering and not from the injustice and military brutality of over 50 years this fraud was perfected in collaboration with the vice president who made a remark about oil thieves it is sad that the vp is showing all the traits of a stooge every part of nigeria has its share of criminality let the british soldiers go to sokoto or katsina to keep the peace there we are not ashamed to declare that our armed struggle will continue until we emancipate our people mend fighters are willing to offer their blood for oil and will do everything necessary to frustrate this dubious alliance
3227156 the mend has an advice for yaradua and it is to the effect that the united kingdom army alone may not be enough to handle the niger delta situation he should as well visit the united states of america germany and france to seek their support and military expertise i wish to reaffirm our stand that we are ready and in fact in a hurry to contain any coalition of sorts resolving the niger delta problem is as easy as a snap of the finger rather the federal government has not only gambled with the situation but has displayed so much injustice and insensitivity to the niger delta problem which is the sure cause of escalation we experience today my heart is full of pain despite massive sufferings of my people due to gross disrespect and neglect by the federal government we still share our resources just to keep nigeria going and yet you cannot find roads in the niger delta no hospitals no schools no electricity and in fact nothing we live in utter penury and squalor and experience the height of pollution gas is flared at close proximity to the host communities and this has increased the level of heat in the region which results in constant sweating and dehydration even the rain which is meant to be a blessing to us has now turned poison as it is simply acidic due to the gas flaring and this leaves our lands withered and parched there is so much injustice within the nigerian state it is so difficult to believe that even a colonial government will be more reasonable than a so called democratic government if a commission during the colonial period could appreciate the efforts of those who produce resources and give commensurate compensations accordingly why cant a democratically elected government do better the federal government is the biggest enemy of the people of the niger delta federal government thinks that we are afraid of the zombie that they call military we can never be afraid of them we only sympathize with them and their families we therefore call on family members who have their relatives as military men in the niger delta to call them back home as the federal government is only using them to achieve their selfish aim which is not in the best interest of nigeria but just to protect their loots how can a reasonable government approve n444 6 billion for security and just n69 billion for development when you have security threat as a result of lack of development does it make sense have they bothered to consider how much can be done with n444 6 billion in terms of development in the niger delta in fact they did not even consider giving part of that money to nddc to support their activities rather they said the nddc money has expired if anything happens to me i believe somebody will take over because as i am talking to you i have already possessed so many young boys in different types of operations we can attack you without you seeing us without us visiting you or anybody we can attack you anyhow we want to attack you inflict destruction on everything that is the truth so for me i believe nigeria is in a problem because they have not seen the real brutality of the real mend that is my own thinking but i believe that in a very short time they will see it i told you that this government is taking the niger delta people as primitive people look let me give you an instance you can build a house they will lease your house and ask you to do security in your own house and at the end of the day your rent will be paid to another person how will you feel you know one thing we need to know why they did all these things many of the people in the system need money so much because as i told you earlier the government has spoiled the psyche of niger delta with poverty so as they throw this proposal so many people will go for it they need the money more than anything but it wont work the highest thing if any militant guides pipeline the militant wont last that is the truth because there is no way we can be security in our own house where we are supposed to employ a security we cannot be guarding our property for the people that ought to be exploiting it for our benefit which is real foolishness it wont even work it is just a stupid idea
3227157 now that the secretary general of the united nations mr kofi annan has sealed the deal made between the presidents of nigeria cameroon and the companies exploring oil over the blood of the bakassi people the die is cast therefore bamosd now declares as follows that with the withdrawal of nigerian troops from the bakassi peninsula which takes away our last line of defense as nigerian citizens and exposes our people to perpetual and permanent bondage of exploitation under development and death which characterized life in the larger niger delta and the gulf of guinea over the last 50 years of multi national oil companies occupation with the connivance of nigerian leaders we are left with no other option than to defend our land and people by any means necessary that our peaceful social economic historical and ancestral ties with the rest of the people of the niger delta leave us not only with no other frontier but with no other option than to join forces with the valiant and heroic freedom fighters of the niger delta that bamosd by this declaration is subsuming all its activities on the bakassi peninsula into the larger war of liberation of the nigeria delta under the joint leadership of the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend and other joints commands for the protection defense and security of its people and resources other forces or operators found within the territorial waters of bakassi shall be considered enemy forces and dealt with accordingly as we speak half of our soldiers from all parts of niger delta are in the creeks awaiting the dooms day nigeria handing over bakassi to cameroon means that nigeria has no right to confront our soldiers so we are calling for nigerian government to stay clear and allow us face our battle because any attempt to clamp on any of our soldiers means confrontation and we shall react likewise we also want to inform the world that henceforth bakassi has become an independent state and shall control its resources to this effect all operators nigerian or foreign exploring or exploiting resources on the bakassi peninsula that has not consulted with the appropriate authorities should leave the territory immediately we emphasize again leave our waters immediately do not say you were not warned there will be no further warnings
3227158 when you explode legitimately against the injustice that has been heaped on you they use the press to make it look like you are a vandal if you are a vandal you have the right to be a vandal they master this imagery this image making they give you the image of an extremist and from then on anything you do is extremism you can pull a baby out of the water and save it from drowning you are still an extremist because they projected this image of you as a subversive and you can go out dying for the united states you are still subversive because the press has made you subversive they can paint the image of you as someone irresponsible and you can come up with the best program that will save the black man from the oppression of the white man and when i say oppression thats where oppression comes from the white man there are some oppressive black people but they are only doing what the whiteman has taught them
3227159 it is possible to heal with words it is also possible to kill with words

3227162 i suggest that they write paragraphs of two or three sentences this may not be what you learned in school but it works a paragraph break in a written document is like a pause in a conversation
3227163 it is hard at first but then it gets much better and now it is probably easier most times because they play together so much
3227164 hes a good baby though it is just really hard for me

3227180 i have no reason to suspect he was going to do any violence but he was irate
3227181 he was very upset i could tell something was bothering him
3227182 ive been here about three and a half years and i went out and told my receptionist i gave her a code that meant call the police
3227183 one thing i wonder is had something happened here as i walked him out had i pointed him out to police there could have been an altercation and hed have been in jail instead of on that road
3227184 there were times when i was doing jack when i actually felt retarded like really retarded
3227185 in a weird way i had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb
3227186 check it out dustin hoffman rain man look retarded act retarded not retarded count toothpicks to your cards autistic sure not retarded you know tom hanks forrest gump slow yes retarded maybe braces on his legs but he charmed the pants off nixon and won a ping pong competition that aint retarded you went full retard man never go full retard
3227187 beyond the limitation on seraph has given pandemonium warden a great attempt and even after eighteen hours was unable to defeat this monster
3227188 the gas thing is padraig would have no idea of that being under appreciated
3227189 i know this is hard to believe like the leaderboard which he doesnt look at and he actually never reads newspapers
3227190 if something comes on the television about him hell turn down the sound
3227191 hell look at the pictures in the paper he never has read articles about himself in the last 10 years because he feels that theres no point
3227192 absurd as it sounds to have the four trophies on your mantelpiece as tiger woods did padraig definitely believes he can do it
3227193 he is in that place and he really does firmly believe that if he keeps working keeps the head down that anything is possible
3227194 coming so soon after his brilliant win in the british open this was a fantastic achievement by padraig
3227195 it makes him the first european golfer to win back to back majors padraig just goes from strength to strength the whole country is immensely proud of him
3227196 to win two british opens back to back is quite an achievement but to win two majors back to back is absolutely incredible
3227197 price reductions are continuing nationally while there have been reductions in all segments of the market the sharper fall in the price of new houses reflects a more aggressive approach by developers in order to stimulate demand
3227198 we estimate that prices will decline by 12pc for the whole of 2008 although the nature of the monthly declines is proving to be protracted
3227199 nevertheless while the monthly rate of decline eased in june we expect ongoing monthly declines to feature for some time yet given the more stringent credit conditions as well as the large overhang of stock in the market
3227200 youll never achieve perfection but youve got to keep trying to get it
3227201 one of the points that has come across in my discussions with other european finance ministers is the widespread concern about the very high levels of profit taking and self reward that is taking place at the higher echelons of the private sector
3227202 i share that view it wouldnt do for employers to expect all the restraint to be on the part of the unions or the workers they have to lead by example it must be demonstrable and it must be verifiable
3227203 we did it without linkage to anything else and as a gesture of good faith i would like to see that kind of example being followed especially for the times we are in
3227204 social partnership has served ireland very well in the past and it has brought a track record of progress over 21 years i am very much of the belief that it is not at an end and that it can serve us just as well into the future although economic conditions are now more difficult
3227205 the taoiseach has asked all sides to reflect on the situation during this month and i too would ask all sides to consider what could be lost partnership is something that will have to be achieved again in some form and the well paid will i think have to face up to their responsibilities
3227206 dont forget that public service retirement lump sums and bonuses have now gone back to what they were before the pay award was introduced
3227207 big increases were scrapped and there is concern already about some of the very high packages we are seeing elsewhere
3227208 whether it is cuts or moderation or something else being given up we need to see that it has to be demonstrable and as i say any deal that is reached in the national interest has to be one that involves shared responsibility across the board

3227212 digamos que aconteceu o que era esperado mas eu queria um pouco mais queria entrar entre os 16 finalistas
3227213 foi uma arbitragem um pouco subjetiva mas de qualquer maneira ele jogou melhor a arbitragem n o desculpa
3227214 you see little things that if they put it all together they could really be good
3227215 there is a lot of talent there but its going to take a while
3227216 being a captain and a veteran on the offense im just trying to get the guys going show em the right way to do it
3227217 i think physically theyre ready to play its a matter of learning what they need to do
3227218 i like the things hes done green is doing well xzavian is continuing to grow and learn those are three gifted young men they all have a chance to help us
3227219 who will start thats too early to predict but theyre going to make us an improved group at wide receiver
3227220 its not like every other day i was telling chris hoiles i can feel it now i can really feel it but ultimately it comes down to playing the game in between the lines and im just trying to have fun with it now
3227221 i didnt want to emasculate myself and go to a nail salon for his acrylic nail
3227222 i wasnt even going for the strikeouts monday i just went for quick innings
3227223 theyre playing well were playing well theyre leading their division and were trying to get the lead in our division weve got some very tough games coming up i think its very imperative that we play well against them here
3227224 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3227225 the worse video ever was the sodomizing of a microbus driver
3227226 this guy was stripped naked and sodomized inside a police station using a wooden stick
3227227 it is a precedent and the first of its kind it is the first severe punishment for torture
3227228 the ministry is the one that finds these mistakes they do not stay quiet about them
3227229 to bring attention to negative public opinion regarding our project of national unity
3227230 you just get used to it after a while you get used to living in that culture of fear
3227231 they did not die we had lost them to harassment and intimidation
3227232 the first time i got a call from state security i freaked out i was terrified
3227233 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3227234 it takes about 25 30 years to prosecute somebody and by that time many of the accused are dead or possibly the relatives that have filed a complaint are dead
3227235 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3227236 from what we understand there is a gang of hoons aged in their twenties from the kallangur area that are behind this
3227237 these are really vicious cases that are deliberately calculated and cruel
3227238 when you look at the case of the crow someone has actually held this bird down and sawed off its wings
3227239 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3227240 clearly if a taser is used as an alternative to shooting someone dead then that is one thing
3227241 if on the other hand a taser was used to repeatedly fire into someone for the purpose of eliciting information then obviously that is a different situation
3227242 i want to beat anyone i tee it up against and it doesnt matter whether its at match play or stroke play
3227243 yet it would be an honour to beat padraig harrington you know just like beating sergio garcia who has been a giant killer himself at the ryder cup
3227244 im ready to go out and play either one of them now it dont matter who paul puts me against
3227245 pretty incredible especially coming after winning the open just three weeks ago
3227246 to shoot eight under par over the weekend on this golf course is almost unimaginable
3227247 winning in the us adds a different dimension to his cv
3227248 this will open up new opportunities in the states to win a major elevates any players status but to capture two opens and then a pga further enhances that
3227249 age aint nothing but a number let him come to you instead of running after him if he still likes you hell im you first on aim

3227253 dat verraste vele anderen maar ook mezelf omdat ik slechts n keer in de week echt aan sport doe dat wordt vanaf vandaag anders maar ik mag mijn eigen trainingsprogramma invullen
3227254 die knie is nog steeds slecht na die wedstrijd van jaap stam had ik drie dagen last
3227255 we willen richting de top van de eerste divisie en in de voorste linie is de huidige selectie kwetsbaar ik heb weinig te winnen maar het zou mooi zijn als ik een paar keer het verschil kan maken met een voorzet of een actie
3227256 dat nog in een woonwijk staat dat heeft iets authentieks cultureel erfgoed en tegen ajax ging het me nog redelijk gemakkelijk af
3227257 die moet ik voorlopig even naast me neerleggen ik ben nu weer even speler
3227258 ik moet maar over de uitstekende benen van verdedigers heen springen als ik geen back voorbij kom dan verdwijn ik weer via de achterdeur het moet geen onemanshow worden zit ik niet op te wachten en de rest ook niet of ik vrijdag fortuna thuis haal dat lijkt me nog iets te snel
3227259 ik ben gebeld dat men graag wil praten over contractverlenging
3227260 laat hem woensdag morgen red eerst maar in de voorronde van de champions league tegen arsenal spelen en kijken hoe hij de affaire ajax heeft verwerkt
3227261 ik heb geen idee waar hij dat vandaan haalt er is al dagen geen contact geweest tussen ajax en fc twente of ons
3227262 door de verklaringen van afellay en frank van kouwen vvv red enerzijds en die van van dongen en schiphorst anderzijds is zowel reglementair als in overtuiging bewezen dat de grove beledigende taal daadwerkelijk tegen de speler is gebruikt
3227263 ik zei naar vervelend typetje en dat hij moest wegwezen
3227264 ab so luut dit is buiten elke discussie ik heb heel goede oren
3227265 in mijn eigen bewoordingen was het wegwezen ophouden nee typetje heb ik ook niet gehoord maar misschien heb ik d t niet opgeslagen
3227266 het woord tyfushond is niet gezegd ik heb alles gehoord dus dat is niet gezegd
3227267 van hulten gaf in het gesprek aan wat hij in het veld had gezegd hetgeen ik ook had gehoord en wat hij in zijn verklaring zou zetten
3227268 ik wijs op de mogelijkheid dat de lezingen van de assistenten zijn be nvloed
3227269 dat zal geen opzet zijn geweest maar er is wel een factor tussengekomen er is het risico van contaminatie
3227270 als afellay maar een paar centimeter ruimte had om de woorden anders te interpreteren had hij dat gedaan hij blijft echter bij zijn verklaring en hetgeen hij op tv zei en van kouwen had ook al geen enkel belang om dingen anders voor te stellen dan hij had gehoord
3227271 schiphorst heeft zegt alles te hebben gehoord maar vervelend en naar niet het woord typetje is van dongen ontgaan
3227272 grove en beledigende taal is al schadelijk als een speler die bezigt maar helemaal als een scheidsrechter die gebruikt ik vind dat er een behoorlijke sanctie moet volgen omdat een arbiter altijd het voorbeeld dient te geven hij moet kalm en onbesproken blijven kijkend naar reglement 22g vraag ik u de heer van hulten het scheidsrechteren te ontzeggen voor drie duels in de jupiler league waarvan n voorwaardelijk
3227273 maar ik weet dat ik het niet heb gezegd en kan mezelf in de spiegel recht aankijken
3227274 all indicators are that the numbers are strong we are not seeing a decrease in the number of visitors and we may even see modest gains
3227275 the owner has the right to demolish but they have to do what they say they are going to do and not use it as a phony way to get rid of everybody
3227276 there does need to be more oversight of the rent guidelines board by the council i do think that to have the r sum s of the board members discussed publicly is a good thing
3227277 obviously the estates lawyers must have believed mrs hammond was an easier target
3227278 use of a companys products for its employees is very standard and the trips represent only a fraction of a percent of toll revenues
3227279 a lot of parents dont have any idea what choking hazards are they would never think of a grape as dangerous
3227280 do you know how many parents dont know that popcorn can choke a child
3227281 if they can put the number of calories on products sold to the public from fast food restaurants then we could put labels on products that are dangerous to children
3227282 putting a sign over grapes it seems a little much
3227283 in an economic climate where food stores bodegas and supermarkets are going out of business it is not the time to add regulatory burdens that make it more difficult for these neighborhood stores to survive and service their community
3227284 popcorn chewing gum hard candies raisins peanut butter nuts or seeds which present a choking hazard to children under four years of age
3227285 if that chart isnt enough to get them to approve it then the parents of the kids in school ought to go man the barricades
3227286 is there anything good enough to just write the story
3227287 the problem is basically new york has spoken against the death penalty with the exception of a situation involving a cop killing
3227288 yet you go on and on and on and prosecute these cases
3227289 set within a framework of consistent and even handed national application of federal capital sentencing laws
3227290 its just not cost effective to willy nilly strive for the death penalty
3227291 it really goes a long way toward hurting the functions of the court and the u s attorneys office in terms to being able to handle the rest of their criminal docket it creates a serious problem
3227292 theres a clear inference that the u s attorneys office was seeking re evaluation
3227293 i want to change the culture of how new york state views deficits
3227294 just a little bit of sacrifice we can get out of this situation
3227295 this is beyond anything weve seen before in our collective memory
3227296 i know the fiscal condition of our hospitals intimately there is no way that all of this money can be pulled out of them without pushing hospitals into bankruptcy
3227297 it makes no sense to ask the families who send kids to cuny and suny to sacrifice while the families who send kids to dalton or harvard make no sacrifice
3227298 debo tener miedo un hombre como tu no debe porque tener miedo
3227299 maybe we like the pain maybe were wired that way because without it i dont know maybe we just wouldnt feel real whats that saying why do i keep hitting myself with a hammer because it feels so good when i stop
3227300 it is taking a little bit longer than originally expected
3227301 were going to have to win a lot of games
3227302 food for people not for profit our prices are set to break even and stay in business
3227303 if somebody is very concerned they have chest pain they have multiple stress tests which are negative they have borderline risk factors like high cholesterol or high blood pressure if this test is normal then we know they do not have obstructive coronary artery disease
3227304 its a little spray we use underneath your tongue two squirts and its absorbed under your tongue and it dilates your coronary arteries so with a slow heart rate and the bigger arteries theyre able to get a good picture
3227305 so that is probably a little mixed plaque a little bit of calcium and a little bit of cholesterol plaque too
3227306 if we are worried that somebody has coronary disease in that case it is better to go for the invasive coronary angioplasty
3227307 my son remember this watch your back youre the man of the house now
3227308 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3227309 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3227310 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3227311 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3227312 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3227313 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3227314 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3227315 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3227316 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3227317 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3227318 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3227319 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3227320 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3227325 the agreement was that the city would administer it the agreement by using the countys subdivision rules because the city agreed they liked the county rules better
3227326 in the last couple of years we have had some problems with the administration of the rules
3227327 in the time ive been here weve had a number of conversations with commissioner letz and all of the commissioners and it has held fast that the city has the right and the obligation to uphold our subdivision rules in the etj
3227328 grants to the city the exclusive authority to regulate subdivision plats and approve related permits within the citys etj
3227329 the county shall not enforce its subdivision regulations within the etj of the city
3227330 the city shall enforce its subdivision regulations within its etj
3227331 last year we did go through a revision of subdivision ordinances and made some changes for more harmony between county and city rules
3227332 from the citys point of view these requirements need to be met
3227333 the etj needs to be built so that it can become a part of the city at some point in time
3227334 it needs to be very clear what the standards are
3227335 because the county must control things like septic systems and flood plains it makes more sense to put administration of the agreement with the county i can live with it being with the city but we need to know the rules and they cant add new rules without our knowledge
3227336 from our point of view the need to double plat comes from the county
3227337 i think we can sit down and work it out
3227338 it is very hard to change the image of tiananmen in peoples hearts just by adding green plants flowers and statues
3227339 the theme is the whole world happily greets the great events of the olympics reform and opening up to create a harmonious period
3227340 i have learnt so much more here than i have in university it makes things much more real and understandable to be in such a rich biodiversity
3227341 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states
3227342 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3227343 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3227344 this visit will open a new page in the relations between both countries
3227345 it will help to benefit both of these brotherly nations and will support the security of iraq and the region
3227346 we learned that many insurgents want to hand themselves over but because of the raids and operations they feared they might be killed
3227347 so the prime minister made this decision to encourage them to stop fighting

3227351 georgia has been such a staunch supporter of america that america owes it to georgia to help in this situation its our responsibility to help the georgians and make sure russia does not occupy them
3227352 their news made them feel that these terrible georgians are killing theyre cutting heads
3227353 having a long history making of payments on time and no missed payments on all credit accounts is one of the most important items lenders look for
3227354 this measures the amount you owe relative to the total amount of credit available someone closer to maxing out all their credit limits is deemed to be a higher risk of late payments in the future and this can lower their credit score
3227355 in general a credit report containing a list of accounts opened for a long time will help your credit score the score considers your oldest account and the average age of all accounts
3227356 opening several new credit accounts in a short period of time can lower your credit score also multiple credit report inquiries can represent a greater risk but this does
3227357 your mix of credit cards retail accounts finance company loans and mortgage loans is considered

3227359 shell be remembered as a good person not by some of the bad things that happen in life because everybody does stuff bad but she just was very much loved down here we just wanted to show that everyone loved her down here
3227360 i called the officer and i said it sounds like someones trying to kill someone because theres a lot of noise and im one building away and im on the corner
3227361 i know im getting older and older people are always a target i didnt ever think i could ever use it for anything
3227362 i saw a guy walking up from behind the buses that they keep like he was going to a car
3227363 i side kicked him and then punched him my punch i was trying to aim for his chest but i think i hit him in the face
3227364 my father acted quickly he acted properly he did not delay and it moved the country ahead much more quickly than it might have otherwise
3227365 as a young lawyer i would hear stories about judge simpson his great sense of fairness great sense of compassion at a time when a lot of federal judges didnt have that
3227366 when youre a young lawyer you look up so much to the established and respected federal judges
3227367 i seen the driver get out and i said uh oh
3227368 well he had it in his left hand and i could see the side of it

3227378 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3227379 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3227380 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3227381 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births
3227382 identifying the specific normal cells that cancer come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3227383 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3227384 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
3227385 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
3227386 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
3227387 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
3227388 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
3227389 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
3227390 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
3227391 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3227392 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3227393 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3227394 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3227474 hanuman s new third cd pedalhorse is a fascinating blend of influences new acoustic blues world music art rock funk southern rock and even a bit of celtic played almost entirely on acoustic instruments though with a rhythmic drive that gives it the energy level of electric music for much of the time the result is great listening marked by tasteful musicianship and innovative stylistic and instrumental mixtures pushkar features scott laws mandolin prominently in a rhythmically challenging piece with a distinctly eastern aura taking a very different direction is the bluesy title track pedalhorse with benoit featured on slide guitar and dobro taking another yet musical direction is hop queen which strikes me has having a kind of tropical island feel one of the pedalhorses definite highlights is baba blues which is imbued with both blues influence and a vaguely exotic quality thanks to kaplans percussion perhaps the albums most impressive musical showpiece is savannah boasting a multi faceted structure like an art rock piece including a jazzy waltz section and dual lead guitar lines reminiscent of an acoustic allman brothers and further to make things interesting there is the vague celtic influence of mothership which features bassist decoster playing his bass with a bow the cd goes out with its spaciest track meeras camel its another interesting amalgam of influences including the bluesy resonator guitar a mandolin that sounds more eastern european than rooted in bluegrass a pump organ and percussion evoking the middle east sonically the album is first rate the acoustic instruments are well recorded with a rich clean unfettered quality with the sound of the acoustic bass being especially pleasing the cd also has a very commendable increasingly a rarity in these days of heavily compressed in your face commercial hits
3227475 the strongest argument for discounting is that not discounting future health would lead to the conclusion that all of societys health resources should be invested in research programs or programs for disease eradication

3227478 whats exciting is were beginning to get younger people along with the older people involved were excited about the mixture
3227479 we need the wisdom from the old but we need the energy that the young people have
3227480 our goal is to have a flag on every single block on this map
3227481 our strength is in having involved people each one of those flags is a person who has agreed to help us by providing information to the people on their block by keeping their block clean by calling police and by reporting code violations
3227482 the officer is really working with us to try to identify properties that need correcting weve made a lot of progress having that officer around
3227483 i try to get residents to come up with a block plan
3227484 i try to get them to look at their block and decide what needs to be changed we shouldnt do it they should do it
3227485 too often we default the responsibility of education to the school district we need to take it back
3227486 your child gets one shot one chance to be a second grader
3227487 you have to make sure you are there for him
3227488 if a teacher hasnt heard from you until there is a problem their defenses will be up
3227489 is your child making the benchmarks the only way to know is to ask
3227490 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3227491 this is not the kind of town that will take this
3227492 planes will fly over areas where they dont fly now and mostly at higher altitudes
3227493 but if you own an estate in hunterdon n j or bedford n y you may not like that
3227494 its not a big deal as far as these things go
3227495 the rerouting takes a significant amount of noise and places it over about 70 of the city
3227496 this is the single biggest choke point in the national system
3227497 you know you go through times where you feel it might not happen but you never ever give up hope
3227498 you dont ever use the word never happen its not healthy
3227499 i do not think its heading to a new trial
3227500 to be in prison for 18 years for something you didnt do and then know you are going to walk out of court a free man thats a lot to take in in one day
3227501 i believe that there are others in prison like me and then there are others in prison who are guilty youve got to give it a chance to work
3227502 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states
3227503 but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show
3227504 people think the homophobia is under control which is not true
3227505 i kind of hide here in the united states because the men who raped me have made threats
3227506 i was set on breastfeeding but my in laws had some misconceptions about it this caused some friction in the family during the early months
3227507 start breastfeeding exclusively as soon as the baby is born for at least six months and after as long as mutually desired
3227508 the mothers who did not breastfeed their babies were not as well educated about breastfeeding with the lack of family support and education they didnt think that breastfeeding was a lifestyle that was possible for them
3227509 i tell them to try but their in laws or husbands may tell them otherwise many mothers start out with the best intentions and then give up after two months
3227510 those on certain strong and toxic medication like cancer drugs or drugs that affect the immune system and brain function should also not breastfeed
3227511 some mums think they dont have enough milk and start supplementing with formula this causes the milk production to go down further
3227512 its like a water tank the milk is replaced only when it is emptied
3227513 this helps with mother baby bonding and helps the mother to sleep more easily but does not tire her its the demands of caring for and adapting to a new baby that makes any new mother tired
3227514 breastfeeding is not called nipple feeding for a reason in proper breastfeeding the baby latches onto the areola the breast tissue around the nipple instead of the nipple
3227515 extremely rare that a mother needs to stop breastfeeding just because of a prescribed medication especially for simple short term illnesses
3227516 they intend to talk to every person in every single house who lives there
3227517 no answer at a door is not an acceptable answer
3227518 cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces

3227522 this is a nightmare for us weve been crying a lot it is a very dangerous situation for our family
3227523 weve known sofiya since she was just 3 years old god bless her i dont think she realizes how much danger shes in

3227525 we want them to reach the american embassy were afraid that if the country declares war her brother might be expected to fight they need to get out

3227527 at a time when we see a declining percentage of our budget coming from state aid any assessment loss is extremely important
3227528 it puts a burden on districts financially and impacts negatively on the kids
3227529 because development has slowed individuals are not buying lots on a large scale so developers may be sitting with a subdivision of 100 lots and selling only five or 10 a year
3227530 id love to be able to look at the purchase price of one of those lots and say since the assessment is reduced 90 percent your sale price should
3227531 our goal is to assess those properties at market value whatever that is
3227532 this is not uncommon and is a means of encouraging economic development without negatively affecting taxing jurisdictions
3227533 you must die and go to hell to experience life
3227534 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3227535 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3227536 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3227537 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together

3227555 were really focusing in on the ninth grade because we know from research that that is where students really begin to lose track of who they are academically
3227556 i look at some of the things weve done at the high school with the idea of trying to increase the number of students graduating from high school and thats a critical need today you have to have a high school diploma
3227557 after a decade of near stagnation new york citys graduation rate has climbed significantly since 2002
3227558 we clearly need to help larger numbers of students to graduate but the progress weve made so far means that thousands more students are graduating today than would have six years ago
3227559 i think a fifth year if it works is perfectly acceptable
3227560 we dont have a regents action item on that yet
3227561 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
3227562 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency

3227595 the most obvious place to put a new interchange would be in richardson
3227596 currently people here cannot get on or off the hov lanes so they cant use it and many folks say they would like to

3227600 its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine
3227601 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3227602 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3227603 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3227604 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3227605 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3227606 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3227607 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are

3227616 neil continues to do an outstanding job for our football club
3227617 extending his term provides a clear direction for our club as well as a stable environment for the coaches and playing group
3227618 under neils full time leadership we have been extraordinarily competitive competing in the finals series each year
3227619 at the same time were delighted with the progress made in terms of list management
3227620 i keep hope because i dont want to believe the other side of it
3227621 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3227622 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3227623 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3227624 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things
3227625 were just hoping this feeling wont last forever were just waiting for our son to come back to us
3227626 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3227627 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3227628 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3227629 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3227630 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3227631 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3227632 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3227633 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3227634 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3227635 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3227636 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3227637 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3227638 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3227639 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3227640 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3227641 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3227642 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3227643 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3227644 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3227645 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3227646 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3227647 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3227648 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3227649 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3227650 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3227651 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3227652 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3227653 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3227654 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3227655 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3227656 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3227657 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3227658 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3227659 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3227660 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3227661 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3227662 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3227663 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3227664 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3227665 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3227666 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3227667 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3227668 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3227669 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3227670 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3227671 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3227672 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3227673 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3227674 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3227675 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3227676 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3227677 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3227678 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3227679 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3227680 working age singles reported roughly average levels of feeling rushed or pressed for time and also of having too much spare time and low to middling levels of life satisfaction
3227681 there have been perceptions of injustice and unfair treatment in different ways
3227682 as we went through the discussions i think people began to see there could possibly be misperceptions

3227690 jaime bien le concept mais il se passe quoi si on veut le truc tout en haut
3227691 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3227692 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3227693 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3227694 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3227695 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3227696 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3227697 just so you all know we did set a record
3227698 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3227699 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3227700 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3227701 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3227702 all the components of this blog are fictitious resemblance of any event fraction or character of this blog to the real world is only coincidence
3227703 5 milion dollars plus means a lot of construction jobs
3227704 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3227705 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3227706 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3227707 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3227708 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3227709 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3227710 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3227711 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3227712 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3227713 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3227714 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3227715 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3227716 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3227717 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3227718 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3227719 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3227720 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3227721 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3227722 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3227723 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3227724 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3227725 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3227726 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3227727 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3227728 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3227729 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3227730 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3227731 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3227732 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3227733 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3227734 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3227735 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3227736 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3227737 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3227738 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3227739 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3227740 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3227741 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3227742 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3227743 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3227744 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3227745 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3227746 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3227747 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3227748 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3227749 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3227750 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3227751 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3227752 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3227753 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3227754 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3227755 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3227756 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3227757 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3227758 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3227759 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3227760 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3227761 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3227762 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3227763 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3227764 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3227765 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3227766 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3227767 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3227768 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3227769 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3227770 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3227771 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3227772 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3227773 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3227774 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3227775 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3227776 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3227777 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3227778 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3227779 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3227780 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3227781 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3227782 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3227783 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3227784 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3227785 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3227786 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3227787 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3227788 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3227789 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3227790 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3227791 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3227792 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3227793 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3227794 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3227795 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3227796 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3227797 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3227798 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3227799 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3227800 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3227801 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3227802 it might well be that at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3227803 hey were playing the defending big ten champs lets not shoot ourselves in the collective foot
3227804 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3227805 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3227806 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3227807 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3227808 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3227809 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3227810 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3227811 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3227812 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3227813 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3227814 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3227815 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3227816 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3227817 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3227818 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3227819 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3227820 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3227821 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3227822 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3227823 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3227824 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3227825 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3227826 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3227827 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3227828 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3227829 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3227830 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3227831 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3227832 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3227833 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3227834 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3227835 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3227836 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3227837 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3227838 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3227839 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3227840 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3227841 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3227842 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3227843 i wanted to jump on the first 100 to see what happened
3227844 i figured my rivals wouldnt see me and hopefully id have enough to hold them off
3227845 im just going to go back to the village to rest and get some food in my system and relax as much as i can
3227846 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3227847 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3227848 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3227849 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3227850 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3227851 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3227852 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3227853 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3227854 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3227855 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3227856 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3227857 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3227858 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3227859 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3227860 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3227861 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3227862 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3227863 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3227864 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3227865 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3227866 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3227867 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3227868 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3227869 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3227870 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3227871 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3227872 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3227873 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3227874 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3227875 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3227876 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3227877 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3227878 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3227879 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3227880 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3227881 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3227882 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3227883 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3227884 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3227885 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3227886 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3227887 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3227888 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3227889 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3227890 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3227891 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3227892 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3227893 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3227894 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3227895 nama intel core i7 akan menjadi brand processor pc yang baru dari kami sedangkan untuk merk core merupakan andalan kami untuk pemasaran pc di masa depan untuk nama i7 sendiri tidak memiliki hubungan langsung dengan netburst pentium 4 yang emnjadi arsitektur generasi ketujuh intel kami menggunakan nama i7 karena simple dan mudah diingat
3227896 trying to get books assigned and things lined up for the kids so that well have them here for the first day of school
3227897 in the past weve really used it to study death the dissection and things like that
3227898 its really neat to find out what different kinds of animals and flora and fauna you can bring to the classroom
3227899 im really happy with the girls that are on the team they look like they work really hard to me and theyre eager to learn how to play
3227900 havia graus preocupantes de seguran a tent mos uma solu o de compromisso que n o pusesse em causa a vida normal de lisboa

3227903 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3227904 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3227905 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3227906 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3227907 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3227908 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3227909 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3227910 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

3227935 thats none of your business why do you ask such a thing
3227936 i just want to know please tell me how much do you make an hour
3227937 if the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed
3227938 ive been thinking maybe i was too hard on you earlier
3227939 its been a long day and i took out my aggravation on you heres the 10 you asked for
3227940 why do you want more money if you already have some
3227941 daddy i have 20 now can i buy an hour of your time please come home early tomorrow i would like to have dinner with you
3227942 we protested for 21 days and are now trying to stop the supplies for the valley and its only after that the congress government has woken
3227943 there is shortage of supplies in jammu the trucks are stopped and in true sense there is a shortage of supplies in jammu
3227944 we are making wholehearted efforts towards that the protestors should not reach the highway and the national highway does not get blocked

3227947 the court confirmed the commissions view that reducing monopoly profits through lower prices is an obvious and significant benefit to gas consumers
3227948 gas consumers have been receiving such benefits since october 2005 when the commission required powerco and vector to lower their average gas pipeline prices by 9 percent and 9 5 percent respectively
3227949 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3227950 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3227951 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3227952 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3227953 take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is word of god
3227954 is describing how we are to speak better circumstances into our lives
3227955 and it is not found in the verse nor is it found in the entire book of ephesians
3227956 but the word rhema of the lord endures forever and this is the word rhema which by the gospel is preached to you
3227957 it is not the faith that god has but the faith of which god is the object
3227958 my house will be called a house of prayer of all nations
3227959 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive quickened us with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved
3227960 you have been born anew not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and abiding word of god
3227961 flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit

3227965 were certainly going to challenge the decision and to that extent we will be exhausting all possible avenues
3227966 i dont want to articulate the legal action or any other action were going to take im simply saying all possibilities will be exhausted
3227967 we are committed as a board to defending our position we consider we should be part of the fabric of the premier competition in new zealand and we are going to exhaust all avenues to ensure we are
3227968 having said that if i was to apply financial considerations against other unions i think we would turn out on a more than favourable level
3227969 if northland rugby is not in the premier competition in my view it will lead virtually to if not the death to a condition near to death of the game in this province
3227970 northland rugby have a huge involvement in the community whether it be schoolboy rugby to the fact that rugby clubs are often the focal point of small communities in northland
3227971 in the absence of us being in the premier game i consider that fabric of our society would be seriously compromised
3227972 i have no hesitation in saying that rugby is a big part of our community in northland and it will be a very sad day for our communities apart from the rugby fraternity if we are eliminated from the premier competition
3227973 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3227974 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3227975 i will be in this business till the day i die
3227976 being in front of the camera is a different story maybe a few more years we will see
3227977 because were only friends right we wont do anything right

3227994 3dxplorer v4 just took a giant leap forward with its multiuser environment and support for live custom avatars now any web site can include an interactive 3d world like a corporate web site staffed by company greeters who can answer questions or show off realistic 3d products and all you do is click a link its because of this accessibility that the association of virtual worlds selected 3dxplorer v4 for its virtual headquarters
3227995 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3227996 with drug costs escalating high above the rate of inflation for the last decade i think it only makes sense to look at different ways that we can control drug costs without sacrificing patient care
3227997 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3227998 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3227999 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3228000 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3228001 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3228002 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3228003 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
3228004 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3228005 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
3228006 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3228007 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3228008 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3228009 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3228010 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3228011 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3228012 i am going to spam ask for healsssss from the dying priest that im not protecting
3228013 weve got to a find a way to get away from this for a day and show up with a sharper vision a little bit more edge and just try and figure our way out of it
3228014 its been nice to get out of an organization where i felt like i was stuck for so long to come here and get the opportunity to pitch every five days has been nice
3228015 you always want to pitch for the team that drafted you they gave me the shot but i was hurt a lot and didnt take advantage of it they had to do what they had to do im just happy to be here and pitching
3228016 it just felt like it was one thing after another
3228017 after the first injury it was kind of hard because id never dealt with injury before that so it was a learning experience but i think i benefited from it
3228018 felt there was enough strength and flexibility its just a matter of tolerating the pain
3228019 theres no such thing as a decoy route as long as you have brett back there
3228020 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not really covered because hes going to hit one of them as long as you can see him he can see you
3228021 when you have a guy who can pressure a defense in many ways you know every route is available on the field
3228022 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming and if youre not looking you could be hit in the head
3228023 favre is definitely a full field quarterback and what i mean by that is some guys will drop back and they look one direction and the half of the field you can pretty much write off
3228024 laveranues he can throw it farther than quarterback chad pennington took it as an insult the wide receiver apparently still upset by penningtons release glared at the fan and muttered an expletive
3228025 he has the innate ability to look one way and still know how to go the other way and get the ball there in time
3228026 a lot of quarterbacks cant go from this side to that side and still fit the ball in hes one of the guys that can he keeps you honest you cant really cheat
3228027 i came into the clubhouse and looked at the lineup and thought i was in left i didnt even look at the name
3228028 johnnys played a lot this is our 18th day in a row and the turf can sometimes be rough on peoples bodies
3228029 johnnys fine its not so much giving johnny a rest as much as its making sure johnny doesnt break down
3228030 we know we have 44 games left and while everyone is trying to look at what its going to take to overtake the division you know what a playoff spot is a playoff spot
3228031 wed love to win the division but weve dug ourselves a hole you cant gain all that ground back in a couple of days
3228032 every series is at a premium every game is at a premium
3228033 with 40 or so games to go every game is at a premium because were chasing a bunch of teams in front of us we need wins thats the bottom line no matter who were playing the twins are in front of us but we have to win a lot of games
3228034 he told brett to stand up and name everybody on the team just like coach mangini always does
3228035 brett was like i cant do that we poked fun at him for having to take orders because brett is older he just laughed i think he enjoyed it
3228036 ive never missed practice its frustrating it was awkward for me very awkward it was frustrating standing there ive never been on the outside like that watching a practice im going to do whatever i can to make sure that doesnt happen again
3228037 i havent missed a practice since god knows how long
3228038 obviously you can tell im frustrated but the only thing i can do is try to get back healthy and come back
3228039 you never want to sit there and watch for me im not used to it its frustrating thats why you do whatever you can to get back you need to be out there you need to practice in order to get better
3228040 he was still out there watching the play but you could see that he was completely out of place
3228041 its a weird feeling when youre standing there watching the practice i know its killing him but that speaks a lot about him hes a tough guy he loves to be out there every day
3228042 you always feel as though you should be able to score sometimes a guy shuts you down but weve got enough guys who can hit the ball that we should be able to score you get to a point where you get tired of always giving the pitcher credit
3228043 and obviously were not playing well and its something weve got to take care of quickly
3228044 i thought sidney pitched a heck of a game he got ground ball after ground ball he really made one mistake and it cost him the game
3228045 i have to get outs if i put zeroes on the board then were probably still playing right now but i didnt do that
3228046 if i were a diplomat i could live wherever i put my hat and ill build an island just for you and the total population two

3228051 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3228052 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3228053 the clubs have too many vested and conflicting interests and are not equipped to deal with these issues consistently
3228054 sadly that is compromising the values and the brand of afl football
3228055 with acts which are offensive to society against the law and which may involve police laying charges the afl should assume control
3228056 they should be dealt with by an afl appointed tribunal chaired by a retired supreme court judge
3228057 what penalties can the afl tribunal impose financial incarceration the death penalty
3228058 it is incredulous that mr jackson thinks it acceptable that after legal process has taken place afl players should face further deliberation by an afl appointed tribunal
3228059 or worse before due legal process has taken place lets leave policing to the police adjudication to the courts and law making to parliament
3228060 ridiculous suggestions which fragment every citizens right to natural justice and constitutionally enshrined rights should be treated with the disdain they deserve
3228061 restaurants are pretty good at supplementing ingredients like replacing a side of rice with pasta
3228062 but asian restaurants wouldnt be able to supplement too much
3228063 theyll be using less of it but do they increase their prices or do they just wear the higher costs
3228064 if people order 10 bags of rice i might sell them three or four
3228065 oh humm yeah oh yes in 2007 right yeah i remember howre you doin
3228066 so have you ever tried to play your title on guitar hero3
3228067 yeah were doin ok and we hope that you wont ask us if we can play through the fire on guitar hero3 because thats really not an original question

3228079 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag
3228080 every morning it was raised and reminded me of what a great nation i come from i hope this flag also brings you and your class the joy and contentment it has brought me
3228081 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3228082 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3228083 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3228084 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3228085 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3228086 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3228087 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3228088 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3228089 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3228090 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3228091 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3228092 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3228093 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3228094 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3228095 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3228096 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3228097 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3228098 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3228099 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3228100 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3228101 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3228102 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3228103 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3228104 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3228105 to spooks what torchwood is to doctor who ie not as good
3228106 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3228107 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3228108 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3228109 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3228110 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3228111 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3228112 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3228113 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3228114 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3228115 i am talking to lawyers to figure out how to make our way ahead we have to decide what to do whether to file an appeal or file a separate public interest litigation pil before the supreme court as the issue concerns women and families all over india he said
3228116 grave abnormalities said a couple of people with children who were born with severe deformities as the foetal malformations were detected late have come forward to join him in the legal fight
3228117 there is one woman from kolkata who called me and said she was eager to chip in
3228118 we usually advise sonography for pregnant women in the 18 19th week

3228412 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light

3228419 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3228420 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3228421 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3228422 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex
3228423 i dont want to say it was a waste of a year

3228427 it is the responsibility of the democratic party to clean up our own backyard and such acts whether you determine them to be illegal or not should not be tolerated
3228428 clearly the attack on davis was directed to take attention away from powers own troubles with his so called charity
3228429 you cant help but think that a large part of the money he said he was raising for war orphans went instead into his own pocket so he could run for congress
3228430 no one is good for nothing if anything you can point to them as a bad example
3228431 hey arent you that chick who wouldnt shut up about sharpies last year

3228433 preliminary information suggests that the police did not engage in a pursuit of mr guliker
3228434 he had his mind made up he was going out
3228435 i expected this to happen any time it could have happened two weeks ago or two months from now it was bound to happen
3228436 he tried to make me promise not to phone the cops but i did
3228437 he began going downhill into depression it was getting worse and worse he was getting violent at home
3228438 it was just something in his brain he was never the same he didnt care anymore he just wished he was dead
3228439 he felt useless he felt like his family didnt need him anymore
3228440 im so sorry it had to happen this way i wish he would have hit a tree or something im just so sorry he took someone else
3228441 it was total devastation it was like a bomb went off with the debris everywhere
3228442 this is a tragic incident for both families affected by this
3228443 victims services has provided the families with support at this difficult time
3228444 heres a man who has obviously got some emotional concerns some health concerns and as a result of those we end up with this accident and now we have a tragedy on the other side because of that situation
3228445 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3228446 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3228447 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3228448 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3228449 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent
3228450 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3228453 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3228454 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3228455 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3228456 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3228457 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3228458 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3228459 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3228460 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

3228464 restaurants are pretty good at supplementing ingredients like replacing a side of rice with pasta
3228465 but asian restaurants wouldnt be able to supplement too much
3228466 theyll be using less of it but do they increase their prices or do they just wear the higher costs
3228467 if people order 10 bags of rice i might sell them three or four

3228496 low proportion of administrative and financial corruption in the country during the current year came because of improved security conditions and control of public sector at all joints done well
3228497 in 2006 and 2007 witnessed significant rates of corruption in the public sector because of political and security situation which was then in iraq which helped to obtain financial corruption operations particularly in signing some contracts
3228498 the existence of a high proportion of administrative corruption in iraq over the past five years
3228499 these assessments were based on the turmoil and political security situation in iraq during these years
3228500 most of the administrative and financial corruption in iraq is not the kind of big in some countries of the world but that is mostly brush which is granted to public sector employees to pass certain transactions
3228501 a large proportion of corruption cases to the existing body integrity is through bribes in the public sector
3228502 not significant issues of corruption as was the case in past years

3228525 the fec had sent two letters to the obama campaign seeking additional information regarding contributions it received that appeared to exceed the 2300 legal limit among those questionable contributions were donations from monir and hosam edwan the obama campaign responded to the first letter in may 2008 but apparently the fec was not satisfied with its response and sent out a second letter to the obama campaign on july 30 2008 requesting additional information for sixteen pages of questionable contributions including several of monir edwans contributions so apparently the obama campaign failed to tell the fec about the refunded money both in its original fec report and in its response to the fecs letter in may of 2008 5 months after they allegedly returned the money otherwise the fec would have had no reason to further question them about these donations in its follow up letter in july which makes the obama campaigns claim that it returned their donations in december all the more difficult to swallow

3228772 barack obama s foreign policy is dangerous na ve and betrays a profound misreading of history
3228773 barack obama s iraq policy will hand al qaeda a victory and undercut our entire position in the middle east while at the same time put a huge source of oil in the hands of terrorists
3228774 barack obama has sent mixed confusing and inconsistent messages on his policy toward israel
3228775 in the primary campaign barack obama consistently campaigned against nafta but has now changed his tune as he has with other issues
3228776 barack obama s judgment about personal and professional affiliations is more than troubling
3228777 obama is simply out of step with how terrorists should be handled he would turn back the clock on how we fight terrorism using the failed strategy of the 1990s as opposed to the post 9 11 strategy that has kept us safe
3228778 barack obama opposes drilling on and offshore to reduce gas and oil prices
3228779 barack obama is to the left of hillary clinton and naral on the issue of life
3228780 barack obama is actually to the left of every member of the u s senate
3228781 ballooning entitlements class warfare hostility toward producers capital and private property protectionism and subsidized central planning
3228782 israeli defense measures are necessary because of the ongoing terrorism launched by hamas controlled elements in gaza if there were no terror activities there would be no need for israels military activity
3228783 lord if i could only have talked to hitler all this might have been avoided
3228784 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3228785 and i said at the time when i opposed the surge that given how wonderfully our troops perform if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and we would see a reduction in the violence
3228786 it is clear at this point that we cannot through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have expect that somehow the situation is going to improve
3228787 my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
3228788 finally in 2006 2007 we started to see that even after an election george bush continued to want to pursue a course that didnt withdraw troops from iraq but actually doubled down and initiated a surge and at that stage i said very clearly not only have we not seen improvements but were actually worsening potentially a situation there

3228794 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
3228795 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces
3228796 the ultimate freedom to stand there and have no clothes on and be your true self
3228797 if there was any place to get naked it would certainly be in central park doing hair groff says
3228798 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
3228799 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that
3228800 the orient is the place where the sun comes from there is a beautiful german word for the east
3228801 the word oriental here has two meanings the oriental sapphire which comes from the east and also the gold of morning the gold of that first morning in purgatory what is the orient if we attempt to define it in a geographical way we encounter something quite strange part of the orient north africa is in the west or what for the greeks and romans was the west egypt is also the orient and the lands of israel asia minor and bactria persia india all of those countries that stretch further and further and have little in common with each other thus for example tartary china japan all of that is our orient hearing the word orient i think we all think first of all of the islamic orient and by extension the orient of northern india

3228812 the moscow bear cannot be challenged through the bars of its own cage georgia is within russias sphere of influence which is why tbilisi has no reason to hope for nato entry anytime soon
3228813 its in the interest of america to intervene this isnt just about georgia its about american principles

3228820 takkan sekali kali beroleh ilmu seorang yang malu tidak juga yang takbur
3228821 aku harus pergi ke kaabah untuk melakukan tawaf tujuh atau 70 kali lalu aku pun datang ke sana untuk melakukan tawaf aku melihat rasulullah saw sedang berdiri melakukan sembahyang saat itu baginda solat menghadap ke syam baitulmaqdis dan baginda menjadikan kaabah di antara dirinya dan negeri syam baginda berdiri di antara rukun hajarul aswad dan rukun yamani aku berkata dalam hati saat aku melihatnya demi allah jika malam ini aku mendengar apa yang dibaca oleh muhammad jika aku sudah mendekatinya dan mendengarkan apa yang dibaca pasti aku akan mengejutkannya aku pun menghampirinya dari balik al hajar dan masuk ke dalam kain kaabah tidak ada jarak antara diriku dan muhammad melainkan hanya dibatasi kain kaabah saja saat aku mendengar al quran hatiku mencair sehingga membuat aku menangis sejak saat itu aku beriman
3228822 dan bacakanlah kepada mereka berita orang yang kami berikan kepadanya ayat kami pengetahuan mengenai isi al quran kemudian dia melepaskan diri daripada ayat itu lalu dia diikuti oleh syaitan sampai dia tergoda maka jadilah dia termasuk orang yang sesat dan jika kami menghendaki sesungguhnya kami tinggikan darjatnya dengan ayat itu tetapi dia cenderung kepada dunia dan menurutkan hawa nafsunya yang rendah maka perumpamaan seperti anjing jika kamu menghalaunya dihulurkan lidahnya dan jika kamu membiarkannya dia menghulurkan lidahnya juga yang demikian itu adalah perumpamaan orang yang mendustakan ayat kami maka ceritakanlah kepada mereka kisah itu supaya mereka berfikir
3228823 ambillah al quran jika ia menguntungkan kamu jika tidak tinggalkan saja

3228825 i was so stunned i didnt know what to do
3228826 we dont talk about it a lot but yeah it does happen
3228827 we dont know exactly how or why its happening and the senator wont talk about it he usually insists that people keep it quiet and just report it to their pastor or priest
3228828 it is always the prosaic person who demands poetic subjects
3228829 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

3228832 the noise was just unbearable it went from sounding like a drag queens party to a rock concert the music was just nonstop
3228833 i hope it serves as a reminder to others that we can take them to court and seize their belongings if they do not cease causing a nuisance to others
3228834 they took 500 to 600 worth of stuff i dont think they should be allowed to do it it isnt right he said
3228835 i didnt play the music that loudly and it wasnt just cher i used to play heavy metal as well
3228836 alan schwarz in that book schwarz notes the interest fans shared in the countability and the elegantly discrete events of the game found in the these numbers were eventually added together at the conclusion of the season so the fan could learn who led the league in any countable category it took until the 1960s for a scientist named george lindsey to dig into the data he discovered many tenets of sabermetrics that were later independently re discovered two decades later lindsey quickly faded into obscurity or more accurately never escaped from it it took for a bored security guard named bill james to get discovered by chance for such works to get published to a large audience the form of sabermetric works were to challenge the prevailing wisdom of announcers journalists front office executives and yeomen scouts the archetypes of such works include slugging average or how many men you put on base and how often you hit extra base hits are the key determinants of offensive production small ball
3228837 yeah what happens when he doesnt know a fastball is coming

3228844 it is a great thing to be able to preserve this information for future generations many families with clark county roots will find it very useful
3228845 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3228846 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3228847 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3228848 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3228849 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3228850 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3228851 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3228852 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3228853 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

3228885 and jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit and behold the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom and the earth shook and the rocks were split the tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many when the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were filled with awe and said truly this was the son of god

3228887 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
3228888 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
3228889 i came to realise how much we take at face value
3228890 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
3228891 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
3228892 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
3228893 sheer incredulity to the conviction that its all just an elaborate joke
3228894 without a platform for communication a head count is almost impossible
3228895 if you will forgive my use of the term global
3228896 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
3228897 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
3228898 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
3228899 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
3228900 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
3228901 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
3228902 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space
3228903 a powerful movement puts mothers at the helm of social change
3228904 guy who got a headache and accidently saved the world
3228905 so the story starts out with bella being all whiny like she usually is but by this time im able to drown all that out i mean ive known her long enough that the whiny part no longer has any effect on me
3228906 oh yeah i got her a bullet proof car which the silly little erm which bella thinks is for safety reasons but my real motives were so that jasper and i could have something to laugh about
3228907 i decided that bella would be happy even without jacob there but i decided the wedding was pretty boring so i invited the do i mean jacob as if i didnt know he makes a big scene when he finds out what we were planning to do on our honey moon as if he didnt know what a honey moon was so after the dog is rid of i take bella to our honey moon on esemes island i choose the place so that when we do have our honey moon that bella doesnt freeze to death
3228908 so we end up well having more than one honey moon only to find out that when a human girl and a vampire boy do the deed that the girl can still get pregnant so we had to rush away from esmes island in order to save bella from the evil thing in her which she ends up wanting to protect like its worth saving it was killing her yet bella loved the best shessh
3228909 y parece altamente probable que los incrementos que se observar n este a o ser n significativamente mayores a los de a os anteriores lo que tendr un impacto importante en la inflaci n
3228910 no ser a raro incluso ver un incremento mayor al 1 0 por ciento
3228911 esto sugiere que la apreciaci n del tipo de cambio est ayudando a que algunos precios de bienes importados bajen y con ello a ejercer cierto freno sobre la inflaci n general
3228912 im concerned that this figure of 100 000 job losses is on top of the treasury prediction in may
3228913 i have asked the government repeatedly to explain why it predicted 134 000 job losses
3228914 this is very serious this is about peoples jobs peoples livelihoods and the government must come clean and indicate where why and which areas of the economy there are going to be job losses
3228915 the reserve bank was put in an impossible position last year by the incoming rudd government
3228916 it had inherited the best economic conditions of any incoming federal government in our history yet both kevin rudd and wayne swan went overboard in their rush to blacken the economic credentials of the howard government
3228917 in fact business and consumer confidence remained strong through the asian economic crisis
3228918 even post september 11 when the world thought it was on the brink of some catastrophic outcome business and consumer confidence dropped but came back up again because people had confidence in the leadership of the country to steer them through these difficult international times
3228919 businesses are all aware of employment minister julia gillards attacks on employers
3228920 she has said time and time again that employers cant be trusted because they will sack good workers for no reason

3228925 a bunch of old patriarchal minded men sat down centuries ago to dictate how the world should be lived and youre listening to them are you fucking stupid
3228926 christianity the belief that a cosmic jewish zombie who was his own father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree yeah makes perfect sense

3228957 according to reliable estimates on average china secretly executes around 22 prisoners every day thats 374 people during the olympic games

3229017 if you were an american family and suddenly a group of tourists showed up and started eating your food

3229019 is there one that is better than the others when it comes to finding good and nutritious food lets find out
3229020 there is no evidence that its more nutritious theres no evidence that its more safe its not sustainable its not any healthier
3229021 for us organic biotech and conventional are all management systems and you use them in terms of balance in how it fits into your operation
3229022 im comfortable with knowing that farmers are good stewards of what theyre doing and therefore that the food that is raised conventionally or through biotech is safe
3229023 for many people organic agriculture and food biotechnology is an either or proposition and in actuality all of these food processes produce foods that are healthy and of benefit

3229043 there are such talks but they are only talks but i will not say that nothing real stands behind them
3229044 the cubans have long awaited us in my opinion they are waiting for us now they will probably not object if we once again set up electronic surveillance posts at the lourdes base or do something else
3229045 to the extent that we do not then we are drawn into the strategic games of others for todays planet is divided into force fields where the interests of countries blocs and coalitions are intertwined we need a system of our own bases abroad such a presence provides a more effective and stable security system
3229046 the us authorities must clearly let the russians know that such a step means crossing a definite threshold stepping across a red line
3229047 we must restore our positions not only in cuba but in other countries
3229048 russia will strive to achieve a multi polar system of international relations
3229049 russia has truly become stronger and is capable of accepting major responsibility for solving problems of a regional and global scale
3229050 aimed at offering the west profound guarantees of mutual security
3229051 the threats of the twenty first century are directed both against russia and against the west
3229052 if there are people in the west who understand that without russia they cannot defend themselves against these threats then we will reach agreement
3229053 the creation of elements of us missile defenses in eastern europe is a long term process
3229054 and if this is a highly debatable threat to russia today then tomorrow or the day after it might become real even now therefore we must seek asymmetrical measures to reduce the threat and to preserve the principle of a guaranteed nuclear response there is no place to hide it is precisely this hypothetical strike that remains the cornerstone of russian american relations in the realm of strategic deterrence
3229055 then all europe with its american military bases in rumania bulgaria and nuclear weapons in germany will end up in our sights

3229069 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade
3229070 we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing
3229071 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalize aids there is not too much money going to aids but too little
3229072 the international aids conference concluded today without a clear plan or any new impetus to reach the 2010 target of universal access to hiv aids prevention treatment and care
3229073 much greater effort will be required to achieve the far higher targets agreed by the worlds leaders at the current rate fewer than 5 million people will be receiving treatment by the end of 2010 instead of the 10 million target
3229074 to say we are disappointed is an understatement has the aids conference become just another expensive gab fest rather than rally the troops officials from government and un agencies talked about 2015 as being good enough and seemed happy to let the 2010 goal slide how many will suffer and die if that happens the air of complacency from officials is profoundly disturbing the message from people on the front lines of this pandemic stands in sharp contrast they know that funding is inadequate health systems weak and medicines are far too expensive
3229075 officials tried to gloss over the real problem of getting aids specific funding to strengthen health systems universal access must mean access to comprehensive health services for all
3229076 big pharma has gone all out to destroy indias role as the pharmacy of the developing world the country supplies eighty percent of the worlds affordable generic antiretroviral medicines since india was obliged to introduce twenty years of patent protection in 2005 under the wto trips agreement relating to intellectual property rights bm brand name companies have rushed to patent key medicines there without any thought to the impact on access each patent granted to brand name companies in india will mean fewer medicines available for people living in poverty many people are under the illusion that arv prices will continue to fall prices for second line medicines are high and will stay high unless the companies adopt a more flexible approach to patent protection
3229077 every year 10 percent of patients in a given cohort must replace their first line treatment by a second line treatment to prevent drug resistance bm and the costs inherent in this switch will increase by 250 percent by 2010 while simply maintaining current access programmes
3229078 a mere 1 perecnt of people living with hiv aids are reported to have been screened for tb
3229079 according to the most recent global data available from the world health organization health experts and activists at the international aids conference are calling upon hiv aids programmes and international donors to ensure universal tb screening of every person who has tested positive for hiv
3229080 tb is a death sentence for people living with hiv aids up to 90 percent of people living with hiv aids will die within a few months of developing active tb if they do not receive proper treatment
3229081 one of the great tragedies of this epidemic is that people who are living with hiv after hard fought battles for access to antiretroviral treatment go on to die needlessly from tb
3229082 i will not be there this will mark the first aids conference i have deliberately missed since 1985 the first such gathering in atlanta
3229083 a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely on an individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
3229084 it is inconceivable that children coming of age in 2021 40 years after the recognized start of this epidemic will feel gratitude toward todays leaders for saddling them with a still widely circulating virus
3229085 the best funded hiv vaccine trials have all failed over recent months or been halted due to serious safety concerns as for cures no leading figure in hiv research has publicly uttered the word cure since the early 1990s
3229086 the fact is there are homeless children and young people dying in australia some from suicide others simply from neglect that is not something our nation can ignore
3229087 the impact of poverty on family breakdown and the havoc on children and young peoples lives cannot be underestimated
3229088 parental unemployment mental illness substance abuse physical sexual and emotional abuse domestic violence neglect inter generational poverty overcrowding in small homes poor communication skills complex family dynamics
3229089 being so young with no home i had no bed no money no clothes wasnt able to bathe or eat and drink
3229090 being left out in the cold and not having any warm clothes shoes to wear
3229091 not knowing where to go to sleep not having privacy cannot have any belongings that are valued because you dont know where you will put them
3229092 frustrated embarrassed helpless and vulnerable hopeless unhappy worthless scared and fearful anxious isolated and lonely angry and envious of other young people with homes and families
3229093 young people are experiencing forced evictions and a failure to locate other suitable housing
3229094 one young person highlighted that even if you found a place to shower and got a job with a uniform such as at a fast food restaurant the low wages make it hard to find permanent accommodation as they rarely cover rents bills and recreation costs
3229095 an accumulated deficit of past under investment in public and community housing
3229096 dead wrong that in a country as wealthy as ours we have 100 000 people who are homeless
3229097 we will need to invest more in data and research to measure outcomes for homeless people
3229098 include undertaking cost benefit analyses and capturing the returns on any new investments in homelessness
3229099 a 40 percent increase in funding for emergency accommodation to make any impact on the unmet demand for emergency accommodation
3229100 reduction in housing affordability including the reduction in public and more broadly social housing stock is the single most significant factor contributing to the increasing problem of homelessness

3229122 in weeks and years past each of us has argued on this page that moscow was pursuing a policy of regime change toward georgia and its pro western democratically elected president mikheil saakashvili we predicted that absent strong and unified western diplomatic involvement we were headed toward a war now tragically an escalation of violence in south ossetia has culminated in a full scale russian invasion of georgia the west and especially the united states could have prevented this war we have arrived at a watershed moment in the wests post cold war relations with russia this is a not a war georgia wanted it believed that it was slowly gaining ground in south ossetia through a strategy of soft power moscow seeks to roll back democratic breakthroughs on its borders to destroy any chance of further nato or e u enlargement and to reestablish a sphere of hegemony over its neighbors by trying to destroy a democratic pro western georgia moscow is sending a message that in its part of the world being close to washington and the west does not pay finally the united states and the european union must make clear that this kind of aggression will affect our relations and russias standing in the west while western military intervention in georgia is out of the question and no one wants a 21st century version of the cold war moscows actions cannot be ignored there is a vast array of political economic and other areas in which russias role and standing will have to be reexamined moscow must also be put on notice that its own prestige project the sochi olympics will be affected by its behavior weak western diplomacy and lack of transatlantic unity failed to prevent an avoidable war only strong transatlantic unity can stop this war and begin to repair the immense damage done otherwise we can add one more issue to the growing list of this administrations foreign policy failures

3229223 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio
3229224 i enjoyed the show thoroughly frank and shane are solid hosts and asked some questions that i really enjoyed answering
3229225 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
3229226 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions

3229229 we did some good things as the half went along
3229230 i was disappointed in the way we kicked off and punted the ball we can do a lot better than that
3229231 we made some plays defensively but we have to tackle better
3229232 you felt it early there were some strange plays and it turned into back and forth
3229233 we didnt pitch well enough from the beginning plain and simple
3229234 we threw too many pitches we had too many walks and too many hit batters
3229235 we got up early came back late we all just battled and got it done
3229236 i think the guys have shown a tremendous ability to stay focused but tonight there were some things that should have been handled a little better than they were
3229237 i gave up four runs in the first inning thats unacceptable i pretty much stunk tonight
3229238 there isnt enough time left for morimoto to get ready and we wouldnt want to raise unrealistic expectations so i wont be sending her
3229239 in the letter laying late night cable it was misstated that shelly became immediately aroused at the sight of my rock hard member straining to be free from my jeans in truth shellys initial demeanor would be best described as visibly uncomfortable and leery she did not achieve a state of arousal until learning after several awkward drinks that performing fellatio would result in a free month of hbo and starz
3229240 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination
3229241 now this was the sin of your sister sodom she and her daughters were arrogant overfed and unconcerned they did not help the poor and needy they were haughty and did detestable things before me therefore i did away with them as you have seen
3229242 usually i know the origin or the background of what the code word means for the play but for ghandi ive forgotten how that one came about six years in this offense we have everything some you question or some are really good because they make sense maybe they give the direction of left or right
3229243 all we have to hear is ghandi and we know what we are doing so i dont know the extent we can talk about the words because thats how we get to that play is by that word so if someone knows what that word means then they can pick up on some stuff

3229332 you dont necessarily look for it but in so many parks its right in front of you
3229333 you almost have to close your eyes to whats happening on the field
3229334 i pay most attention to what were doing it doesnt really matter what the other teams are doing if youre not winning
3229335 every game is a playoff game for us were really going to show what this team is made of character wise

3229358 the sting operation shows that lalu prasad has not only turned around his ministry but his family as well lalu who serves in the backdrop of the fodder scam has devised ways of selling railway interests

3229361 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3229362 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3229363 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3229364 we have never been and will never be a passive observer in the region

3229385 married life must be exhausting for coleen shes only managed to move from the pool to the sunbed all week
3229386 for me the last four years have been tough after athens it was hard to take the plunge all over again but i decided to take it i worked hard and went for it theres not much to say except that you keep at it and at it one day it falls in your hand thats what happened
3229387 i wasnt thinking about history i was two points behind the leader i just wanted to shoot and i wanted to shoot aggressively and thats what i did
3229388 my son has proved that singh is king in a real sense he has brought laurels for the whole sikh community and for the whole nation
3229389 i had sent him an sms in the morning abhinav you can do it go for it but i am sure he must have not seen it on hearing the results i was breathless and started screaming in joy

3229392 its a great day in the history of indian sports finally we have won an individual gold the youth in the country have got a new icon in abhinav bindra i hope they will now be drawn more towards olympic sports
3229393 bindra has done the country proud this is far bigger than any other sporting achievement it is difficult to compare indias sporting laurels but i think this one has eclipsed all other feats
3229394 i dont see any reason why bindra shouldnt make at least a couple of crores tens of millions of rupees now
3229395 he is young good looking and has a photogenic face all of these factors count for signing up decent contracts
3229396 the step has been taken to encourage socially and economically backward students to come forward to enrol themselves in higher education we have decided to constitute delhi higher education aid trust which would be headed by the minister for higher education
3229397 the trust would provide scholarships education loans stipends prizes and other financial assistance to economically backward students
3229398 the government would also allow self financing institutions to run second shift on a condition that they will deposit 25 percent of the total fee collected from students admitted in the second shift with hesf higher education scholarship fund for providing the scholarships
3229399 the entire country is proud of abhinav who has won a gold medal in an individual event for the country
3229400 the new institute would have to prove that it is operating in the lal dora and extended lal dora for at least two years prior to the notification of mpd 2021 master plan delhi and it has a no objection certificate from the concerned regulatory body
3229401 the media has tried to portray her as a party girl but that is not right she is really down to earth and she puts on that act just for a bit of fun
3229402 what you see on television there s no airs and graces about stephanie that s just natural that s just the way she is
3229403 i made her this cabinet to put on the wall to show her medals off
3229404 there was room for about 50 medals in that and she filled that in no time
3229405 now i told her she will just have to reserve that for gold medals and put the others in a drawer
3229406 i thought it was a well controlled race and i always felt quite confident that she would win it
3229407 she s a great fighter she is in wonderful condition and that is one of her great attributes that she can swim flat out for the full distance
3229408 she seemed to have a natural tendency to be able to swim up and down the pool there would hardly be a ripple in the water
3229409 it was a unit where we were having a holiday up at caloundra and there was pool at the back of the unit block
3229410 according to our information russian troops have entered poti as well as being in senaki and zugdidi

3229413 you should be able to buy wine at a grocery store you should be able to buy it by mail this is a consumer issue this isnt a liquor issue or the evils of alcohol issue this is a right to access the interstate market for goods and the legislature on its own will not change the laws
3229414 for example shipping laws have been introduced in the legislature for at least the last four or five years but they always get tabled
3229415 lobby groups which are basically the tennessee wineries and now more recently grocery stores that want to sell wine theyre not very effective in combating the wholesalers lobbying efforts
3229416 all of the laws are constructed to protect the wholesalers from competition and i think the lobby of alcohol wholesalers try to work very hard to prevent shipping laws from being passed in tennessee
3229417 allowing interstate carrier shipments of alcohol entails a host of undesirable consequences most notably undermining the sound regulatory goal of age verification
3229418 this is a substantial number of dollars for the state in terms of sales tax and excise tax i mean why turn away 10 million to 20 million in added net revenue
3229419 one of the many extremely happy customers when the law changed
3229420 i want to be able to purchase wine in a grocery store
3229421 i want to be able to purchase wine at a convenience store i want local wineries to be able to ship wine to my house or out of state to my family i want stores to be able to have taste testings i want to be able to order wine from france and have it shipped to my home all of these things are happening in most u s states today tennessee is losing out on millions of tax dollars while wine lovers like myself go to very difficult measures to obtain the wines we love
3229422 im hopeful in a month from now well have hundreds of members and between now and the next legislative session its my hope we grow to thousands of members
3229423 i think this is an issue that a lot of people realize is not fair
3229424 what id like to see in the next legislative session is some of the laws introduced finally get to be voted on and dont get tabled in committee i think its just a matter of time before it happens
3229425 walk away clause that allows the city to sever its contact if theres no evidence after a year that red light cameras improved intersection safety
3229426 revenue cameras saying they are a way for the city to boost its income stream
3229427 but it feels like it is becoming more normal at least until next thursday
3229428 one thing about drought conditions the ground lacks the normal moisture and when you get sunshine coming down on ground that is dry it doesnt have to expend some of its energy into evaporation so more of that energy just goes into heat
3229429 theres been a few heavy rain days this summer that have bumped up the precipitation but its not really widespread as we need
3229430 we need moderate rain over several days we are just getting scattered types of precipitation or heavy rain one day and dry for several days
3229431 weve had some high demand in june and earlier this week but as far as now goes temperatures have moderated quite a bit
3229432 it hasnt been quite as hot as last year and there hasnt been as much demand this year
3229433 the weather is not as oppressive as it was last year
3229434 we had so many days at 90 and above last year we were able to provide 275 air conditioners to individuals and families who did not have any means of cooling the requests we are receiving now are for those who have health problems exacerbated by heat
3229435 the national laboratories in general are under a mandate to include more renewable energy in their energy portfolios
3229436 were looking at the effective integration of solar energy into the communities
3229437 relative to building a new steam plant dollar for dollar its not comparable
3229438 really know why blacks see it as a racist symbol
3229439 racial or ethnic slurs or symbols gang affiliations vulgar subversive or sexually suggestive language or images
3229440 the school board tells mr defoe he should be ashamed of who he is
3229441 we fully understand the confederate flag is not a racist symbol to everybody
3229442 but there are others who consider that to be a racist symbol
3229443 zero racial incidents in mr defoes school during his entire senior year
3229444 what you will hear is there is an element hopefully a very small element who want to use that symbol to bully to intimidate
3229445 they just got on the first yellow bus they saw
3229446 im sure a lot of principals and teachers take care of things without me ever hearing about it
3229447 nfs is a great addition to the b amp w portfolio of businesses complementing the products and services we currently provide

3229453 were all doing this overflow thing now to try to house families in the shelters as opposed to putting so many people in the drake hotel
3229454 theres no affordable housing ive been looking for a job for six months
3229455 the thing with poverty is that even if people are working one minor setback can send a whole family into a tailspin
3229456 if we can get through this economic time when we come out the other side i believe the changes will show great results
3229457 i am sorry i made a mistake i want us to get back together
3229458 i was driving down folsom street in san francisco and i got a dropped call 10 times i get dropped calls just standing in one place
3229459 im extremely annoyed but im hopeful a software update will fix it
3229460 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play
3229461 im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3229462 they dont have those bargain basement offers that they used to have two to three years ago
3229463 another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3229464 the country is probably going through the most severe credit crunch since 1991 92
3229465 i think bank credit is going to remain tight for a while
3229466 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3229467 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3229468 this operation pre dates project wickenby but it is another example of how the afp in concert with its project wickenby partners continues to focus on arrangements involving offshore secrecy havens and money laundering to ensure those involved pay their fair share of tax
3229469 appears to be related to disclosures regarding the approval process for provenge and trading in the companys stock
3229470 result of the unexpected time needed to complete the complex accounting for recent financings
3229471 i would like to try the valencia orange flavor it sounds light and refreshing

3229474 one person new to the payroll is clive papayanis caterer and owner of boheme
3229475 my point is we do things for the community we give an equal voice to our readers we dont believe in editors and journalists in the old school way we believe in people those same people who give those journalists and editors their stories
3229476 gossip with the caveat that hearsay is inevitably fraught with inconsistency exaggeration and falsehoods
3229477 a lot of the commodity funds seem to be unwinding positions and us dollars are getting bought at the same time as they are selling aussie
3229478 the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about
3229479 we are just hoping that this wont last too much longer hopefully we are just waiting for our son to come back to us
3229480 i still keep that hope that he is still alive i dont want to look at the other side of it

3229582 section 4 pleading a general rule 45 definition and system pleadings in the district and county courts shall a be by petition and answer b consist of a statement in plain and concise language of the plaintiffs cause of action or the defendants grounds of defense that an allegation be evidentiary or be of legal conclusion shall not be grounds for objection when fair notice to the opponent is given by the allegations as a whole c contain any other matter which may be required by any law or rule authorizing or regulating any particular action or defense d be in writing on paper measuring approximately 8 inches by 11 inches and signed by the party or his attorney and either the signed original together with any verification or a copy of said original and copy of any such verification shall be filed with the court the use of recycled paper is strongly encouraged when a copy of the signed original is tendered for filing the party or his attorney filing such copy is required to maintain the signed original for inspection by the court or any party incident to the suit should a question be raised as to its authenticity all pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice
3229583 now i must also say that i have never seen a judge correct a lawyer about the use of the term i attribute that not to either the lawyer or judge being ignorant but to the fact that a dispute rarely arises where the definition of pleading is the crux of the issue we have a sanction rule in the texas rules of civil procedure for attorneys or parties signing or filing false pleadings or pleadings otherwise meant to harass etc that rule states the prohibition applies to pleadings pleas motions applications etc so the fact that someone signed a false motion and called it a pleading doesnt matter when that rule is applied because the outcome is the same granted i have not re read the rules of civil procedure to determine where the distinction between a pleading and some other document makes a difference but off the top of my head i am thinking that maybe it would matter when fighting about judicial admissions maybe

3229599 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3229600 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3229605 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3229606 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3229607 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3229608 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me

3229636 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3229637 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3229638 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3229679 we very strongly feel that by 2015 indian software product business revenues would be more evenly balanced between domestic and export based sales and the share of revenues from the domestic market would increase from 32 per cent in fy08 to an average of 41 per cent by fy15 to reach 4 5 billion

3229724 people who lost excess weight were more likely to attain their blood sugar and blood pressure goals than people who gained weight or maintained a stable weight
3229725 we looked at their weight over three years and looked at blood sugar and blood pressure readings in the fourth year
3229726 we used all of the weights available to plot these trajectories
3229727 thats how we were able to identify this weight loss group
3229728 you shouldnt get discouraged if you regain some or all of what you lose because your blood sugar and blood pressure control may still be better

3229738 in my mind im still keeping up because i dont want to lose that hope im hoping theres someone in the country who knows where he is
3229739 im just looking everywhere and pleading for someone to help my son and find him
3229740 not at all not at all i dont think about that part of the park i know the police officers are trying to do their best to try and wipe out all the doubt because it was pretty cold and i dont believe he would be going there
3229741 the place he tries to go to is the childrens corner in the park theres a swing and slide and he used to go there and hes very fascinated by all these things

3229753 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3229754 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3229755 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3229756 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3229764 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3229779 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3229780 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3229781 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3229782 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3229783 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3229784 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3229785 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3229786 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3229787 who are open to doing something on the production side
3229788 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3229789 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

3229792 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3229844 for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
3229845 in upholding the display of roadside crosses on public land throughout the state of utah the district court embraced the states characterization of the cross the clearest and most universally recognized marker of christianity as nothing more than a secular symbol of death
3229846 this conclusion is historically inaccurate blind to contemporary realities and offensive to believers and nonbelievers alike

3229853 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3229854 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3229855 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3229856 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3229857 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3229858 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3229859 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3229860 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3229861 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3229862 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3229863 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3229864 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3229865 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3229866 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3229867 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3229868 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3229869 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3229870 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

3229875 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3229876 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3229877 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3229878 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3229879 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3229880 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3229887 when i think of my brother i think of a unique individual living his life
3229888 he always managed to light up a room yet he was very down to earth when i was down he was always there to pick me up even when my heart was breaking
3229889 it is such a tragedy it is dreadfully hard that i will not see you again you will always be in my heart you will always remain a part of me

3229895 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3229896 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3229897 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3229898 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3229899 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3229900 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3229901 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3229902 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3229903 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3229904 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3229905 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3229906 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3229907 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3229908 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3229909 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3229910 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3229911 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3229912 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3229913 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3229914 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3229915 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3229916 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3229917 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3229918 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3229919 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3229920 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3229921 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3229922 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3229923 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3229924 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3229925 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3229926 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3229927 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3229928 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3229929 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3229930 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3229931 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3229932 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3229933 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3229934 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3229941 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3229942 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3229943 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3229944 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3229945 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
3229946 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
3229947 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all

3229953 takes too long to get permits to build on wetlands
3229954 i dont trust the federal government to come in and tell us what to do
3229955 the draconian nature of some of their actions has stopped businesses from expanding and creating jobs
3229956 the federal government has much more experience in the wetlands permitting process and will properly balance the protection of our natural resources with the inherent need for economic development
