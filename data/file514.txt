5140002 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5140003 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5140004 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5140005 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5140006 we are very happy to announce that this autumn we will be doing an extensive european tour
5140007 the hindsight tour is a celebration of past and present featuring unheard classics from the past and unheard classics for the future

5140010 more info on the tour and the new album will follow soon
5140011 for the first time in our bands history weve decided to create a concept album
5140012 the story contained on the record takes place in a mysthical set indeed which is created by the mansion of countess josephine von kuchmeister the inspiration for which was the villa caro in gliwice and the palace in plawniowice
5140013 the title solfernus is of course not the main character of the story but its eminence grise
5140014 one more time the darzamats record will also be produced beyond the polish borders
5140015 whats already known are the titles of the pieces that will appear on the new bands publishing solfernus path will contain the following songs false sleepwalker vote for heresy final conjuration pain collector gloria inferni solfernus path lunar silhouette king of burning anthems chimera a mesmeric s ance
5140016 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5140017 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5140018 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5140019 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5140020 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5140021 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5140022 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5140024 we are hoping to get into patients within the next 12 months or so
5140025 we know at the moment in rat studies that our compound inhibited the development of fibrosis and the interesting thing in the future would be to see whether we can actually reverse fibrosis
5140026 currently we have some quite strong data showing that our compounds prevent fibrosis occurring
5140027 we have looked at it in a series of animal models that are very predictive of clinical outcomes hence the reason we are quite confident that our data is robust
5140028 a lot of the remodelling or the fibrosis that occurs in patients with heart attacks causes the heart to fail over the short term
5140029 if it was the first of its kind on the market it would be a huge step forward because there are currently no anti fibrotics on the market
5140030 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america

5140060 this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil

5140473 why do you think some of these athletes keep doing it why do they keep coming back and training so hard
5140474 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5140475 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5140476 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5140477 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5140478 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5140479 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5140480 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5140486 i knew i was throwing a perfect game i was trying to get the perfect game or a least a no hitter
5140487 he was really fighting it off and i was started to get nervous there
5140488 he was just fouling it off and fouling it off and all of a sudden i had three balls on him
5140489 honestly id dreamt of maybe being a hero of one of the games and win the world series eventually
5140490 but this was a great game all around that was incredible
5140491 its a lot easier to call a baseball game when the offense gives you some runs
5140492 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5140493 we know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places primarily but not totally exclusively on the east and south coasts
5140494 its a particularly huge issue in east anglia but in quite a number of other areas as well
5140495 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5140496 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place
5140497 we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5140506 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5140507 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said

5140522 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5140523 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5140524 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw

5140538 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5140539 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5140540 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5140541 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
5140542 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
5140543 and god saw all that he had created and it was very good
5140544 labels can be destructive especially when applied to children call a child shy and they begin to believe that call a child a loser good for nothing and they often grow up without direction but call a child a star or outstanding or any other positive affirmation and they often excel
5140545 i give an expression of care every day to each child to help him realize that he is unique

5140553 gee you should have thought of that before you gave me tenure

5140557 the aladdin attraction had all the latest and greatest virtual reality technology but there was a problem
5140558 people would play with the aladdin attraction and after a minute or so theyd get bored and ask what they were supposed to do so we came up with a story the magic lamp had been broken up into five pieces and they had to go out and find them after that people could play for hours
5140559 i got an email from a student that started off randy i need to tell you that not all of our team members carried an equal share of the load and right here i thought oh boy heres another person complaining about his team members this happens every semester and i always say that we change the teams after every project so that everyone gets to work with everyone else so i dont want to hear any complaints but then the email surprised me it said on this project i did not do as much work as the others please give some of my points to them i had never seen something like this before and i didnt know what to do and i decided that the fair thing to do would be to put it to a vote by a show of hands how many people think i should give some of this persons points to his team members keeping in mind theres no guarantee that this will happen when you get stuck with a bad person ok the ayes have it

5140562 a win versus a good football team im pleased with that we do want to keep in perspective that it was a preseason game although preseason games are important naturally in the development of the offense defense and special teams and the cohesiveness of the group
5140563 i thought we played very physical defensively we had several turnovers in the game some of it was our causing some of it was their mistakes nonetheless those were important we kept the yardage down
5140564 i saw several players make some plays but i know one player that caught my attention on some plays was ray macdonald hes working very well on the defense both on the base downs and in the sub package he works closely with justin smith the two of them are working together well as far as pass rush situations whether its on the outside or whether its the inside they mix it up both
5140565 it really feels great its a blessing from god the cornerback tried to play me press and i beat him off the line our quarterback made a great throw i just went up to get it
5140566 its football thats the way i look at it its football no matter where youre at god put me here to play this sport its football so were going to play football just like we play at home
5140567 i think i improved a little bit since oakland i think i got more snaps than i did in the first game as the fourth quarter came i started getting a rhythm and getting a feel for the game so i was able to make a couple of plays in the fourth quarter i feel i improved a little bit but ive got a long way to go
5140568 it is about everybody doing what they are supposed to do trusting each other to be exactly where theyre supposed to be especially the wide receivers trusting the offensive line to hold up and protect like they did tonight and for us qbs to put the ball exactly where its supposed to be when all those things and the running game are jelling it is going to be really fun to watch this offense
5140569 it just makes me excited every time im back there i know how close we are i know how good we could be i just want to continue to work hard securing every catch securing the ball then breaking tackles its just doing my part and not trying to do too much and just getting positive yards every time
5140570 i think i did some things okay but the things that stick out in my mind are a couple of missed opportunities the long bomb to josh morgan and the high ball in the back of the end zone to jason hill
5140571 i hope so it is hard to tell youre asking the wrong guy i think so from talking to coach nolan they talked about going into the third preseason game and battling it out until then i just hope i get the opportunity to start
5140572 its getting there just with time and the reps going over the playbook trying to understand what were trying to get out of the plays and what we are trying to do the better i will get so absolutely im feeling more comfortable
5140573 protection wasnt very good they pushed in the pocket consistently really it was something that happened throughout the game and i thought the 49ers played at a higher level than us
5140574 i think he made some good throws he had some good timing throws he threw the ball right when vernon davis caught it he threw it right when he turned around so i would say he had good timing
5140575 awful awful awful awful i dont think we played well from last week we felt like we had a little spark coming into this week but as an offense we didnt play well
5140576 dont worry sweetie im only going to watch one game today
5140577 honey is it ok if i dont put on make up today
5140578 sweetie id like to watch barefoot contessa and see what shes cooking today
5140579 great idea i love barefoot contessa and while were at it maybe we can catch an episode of what not to wear
5140580 it was a tight ballgame and all of the sudden it wasnt
5140581 its always good to have a good game but you cant walk around and be happy because you did good and the team didnt
5140582 the other day i struck out three times but we won its mostly about playing for the team what gets you rbis is having guys on base what gets you good pitches to hit is having guys on base if i score runs its because other guys are doing well
5140583 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5140606 senator obama will stand with the teamsters when it comes to fighting for working families
5140607 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5140608 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5140609 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim
5140610 the obama rebuttal misses the point in claiming my statements about the school registration are a lie
5140611 it is clearly true that the an american expat in southeast asia blog did state the registration listed obama as an indonesian citizen and a muslim that is not a lie
5140612 now that we have the ap photo we see the blog was correct in describing the registration
5140613 the most convincing evidence obama was living in indonesia as a muslim not simply registered as muslim because his father was muslim comes from obamas experience at the government run public school at sdn 1 menteng jakarta not from his time at the
5140614 to put it quite simply mengaji classes are not something that a non practicing or so called moderate muslim family would ever send their child to
5140615 the obama campaign desperately wants to deny obama was raised as a muslim child in the four years he lived in indonesia from age 6 to 10
5140616 what the record clearly shows is not only that obama received islamic instruction at least in the public school he attended
5140617 but he received the type of islamic instruction reserved for muslim children in a government school system that mandated islamic instruction at that time for all children attending public school in indonesia

5140628 and yet without tribulations and temptations we can now no more grow than herbs or corn without rain
5140629 suffer we must ere we were born god decreed it and it is easier to complain of his decree than to change it it is true terrors of conscience cast us down and yet without terrors of conscience we cannot be raised us again fears and doubtings shake us and yet without fear and doubtings we should soon sleep and lose our hold of christ tribulation and temptations will almost loose us at the root and yet without tribulations and temptations we can now no more grow than herbs or corn without rain sin and satan and the world will say and cry in our ear that we have a hard reckoning to make in judgment and yet none of these three except they lie dare say in our face that our sin can change the tenor of the new covenant
5140630 the most amazing thing i saw was bolts poise for a guy as young as he is 21 on the olympic stage
5140631 it was truly amazing how poised he was so relaxed and confident
5140632 one thing that helped bolts confidence was he ran a 9
5140633 the thing that amazes me about bolt is that with his frame hes able to be even or ahead of the field after 40 meters when youre over six feet tall you are running people down starting slow and having to come from behind
5140634 i ran against steve williams steve riddick they were 6 3 6 4 and they came out and got you at the end we shorter sprinters like glance were always ahead early
5140635 the only thing bolt did wrong was ease up at the tape from the blocks to 70 meters he couldnt have executed more perfectly from the blocks to 70 meters i have not seen anyone in the history of our sport do what he did

5140640 at a community level we need the whole community to take responsibility for every kid in their area
5140641 im encouraging people if they have a kid in their street to come together to work out a strategy to include the young person
5140642 usually its dislocation between kids and adults that cause these problems if you reach out to kids they usually respond

5140655 all translations given are from the original texts they do not always agree with earlier renderings and we hope on other occasions to present the philological justifications for them
5140656 sections of this text were translated by s n kramer sacred marriage rite 127 ff and more recently by th jacobsen the treasures of darkness p 49ff
5140657 the notes are intended for the general reader sumerologists will normally i hope have little difficulty in seeing how i arrived at the translations given for cases where that is not obvious i hope to make available the relevant philological and text critical notes in separate journal articles or otherwise
5140658 until 1944 the mythological tales inscribed on the hundreds of tablets and fragments lying about unidentified uncatalogued and unstudied in museum drawers were largely unknown and sumerian mythology was virtually terra incognita for the cuneiformist let alone the humanist and lay reader the collection entitled mythology of all the races published in thirteen volumes between the years 1916 and 1932 includes one volume on semitic mythology by stephen langdon langdon does attempt to sketch some of the sumerian mythological concepts but because of the very limited source material available at the time as well as the serious linguistic problems that langdon failed to treat adequately its conclusions are quite untrustworthy and misleading
5140659 there are few archaeological excavations which have had such an abiding interest for the general public as those at ur in modern iraq directed by sir leonard woolley between 1922 and 1934 in accepting the publishers invitation to produce a revised edition of this book under its original main title i have followed the lines indicated here by woolley for his own account in 1954 i have striven to retain the immediacy and vivid quality of his original text in which nothing was made too difficult for the general reader whilst presenting the record of a fifty year old excavation in the context of modern study this has inevitably involved changes some of them substantial
5140660 we should then have to give the ancient sumerians full credit for the taming of equus onager and its use as a draft animal for war chariots an accomplishment all that more characteristic of ancient sumerian culture because so far as we know the onager has nowhere since been tamed on an extensive scale in any event the taming of the onager remained restricted to the sumerian culture the later culture apparently knew it no more it must therefore have been abandoned in akkadian times
5140661 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa

5140677 when we as people stand together on some common ground we can resolve any differences that face us overcome any challenge that threatens us but when we stand apart and emphasize our differences no solution is possible because nobody cooperates with anybody who seems to be against them

5140679 the cabinet decision is additional proof that the kadima labor government is subverting ethical and security norms
5140680 instead of taking a position of attacking terror the government is freeing terrorists with blood on their hands in exchange for nothing while gilad shalit continues to rot in jail the inevitable result is that terror organizations will understand that they can send more terrorists to carry out more attacks in israel and theyll know that one day they too will be freed
5140681 the blood of the innocent victims who will be killed by the released terrorists will be on the head of this government
5140682 a government that frees terrorists as a gesture and not even as part of an exchange is a government that has no regard for the justice system that convicted them nor for human life and has blood on its own hands
5140683 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister
5140684 for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
5140685 olmert told us his goal is to reach an agreement on paper
5140686 seriously can you propose something in or out of the box that is reasonable which the

5140690 i think hope the imbalances could be rectified in a good free market econo
5140691 the bleeding hearts in the republican party continue to allow this trickle out economics while the corporate class sings their new found
5140692 while loyal american employees of these collectivist giants continue to disdain the international workers labor day of may 1
5140693 is appearing in our body politic the democrats are starting to beat back the republicans who preach loyalty to the fief of the corporation collective and its lord caste
5140694 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5140695 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5140696 we do have a defence relationship with india which is no secret on the other hand what is secret is the defence relationship
5140697 with all due respect the secret part will remain a secret
5140698 certain issues need to remain under wraps for whatever reason
5140699 india and israel took giant leaps forward in bolstering the existing strategic ties and forging new ones
5140700 agreed to share its expertise with india various fields as anti fidayeen operations surveillance satellites intelligence sharing and space exploration
5140701 from anti missile systems to hi tech radars from sky drones to night vision equipment indo israeli defense cooperation has known no bounds in recent times
5140702 sale might affect the conventional weapons balance between india and pakistan
5140703 israel could be acquiring an element of strategic depth by setting up logistical bases in the indian ocean for its navy
5140704 our ties with india dont have any limitations as long as india and israel are friendly it is a strategic gain
5140705 some external forces were trying to weaken pak china strategic ties by creating misunderstandings
5140706 we want good relations with china but if we reach a point of conflict over tibet we should be prepared for that eventuality
5140707 collaborated with the indian military and american cia to organise indian tibetan special border troops to fight their way back into tibet
5140708 foreign hands were also involved in the acts of terrorism
5140709 turn on the air mom im sweating my balls off
5140710 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5140711 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5140712 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5140713 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5140714 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5140715 a wechsler measure created especially for assessing multiple dimensions of cognitive ability using pictorial directions minimal language and no pantomime the child does not need to speak in order to respond

5140717 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
5140718 how design thinking will be able to help business leaders articulate their vision
5140719 was attacked by the left on dailykos this follows a pattern the kos left has followed since 9 11 of defending the jihadists and attacking the defenders of freedom in this country and abroad
5140720 the leader of this attack was an academic with a long history of intellectual dyslexia named john k wilson or perhaps john has dyslexia pure and simple since he is apparently unable to read an english sentence and parse its meaning
5140721 i did not say that the jew hating gay bashing misongynistic sic speakers sponsored by the msa should not be allowed to speak
5140722 the fact is that wilson and the daily kos zealots are hypocrites in attacking us because we dont think the university should be sponsoring hate
5140723 whether youre mocking liberals or conservatives you should be entitled to free speech on campus
5140724 in attacking us for speaking out against hatred that comes with a muslim label in defending overtly genocidal terror groups like hizbollah wilson and kos demonstrate their concern is not a principle such as free speech but a cause which is anti american anti gay anti woman anti christian and anti jew
5140725 when your daddy and i were in graduate school together we knew a man with your name and he was a really nice guy just like you are so right away we kind of liked the name
5140726 youre daddy and i went out to lunch at a restaurant in the city this restaurant made their very own brand of beer called snags ale they even had coasters they served your drinks on theyd bring your glass of iced tea or soda or beer or whatever you ordered to drink and put it on a coaster that said snags ale ale by the way is a kind of beer anyway when we saw the coaster it reminded us again how much we liked the name snags and i even took one of those coasters home with me
5140727 we even have these glasses like the one you are drinking out of that we bought from that very same restaurant and the glass as you can see says snags ale on it so you have drinking glasses with your name on it
5140728 remember your daddy and i liked the name snags there was that nice man at graduate school and oh also there is a character in a movie with your name and its a good movie too and so when we saw the coaster with the name of the beer on it it just reminded us that we liked the name snags so you see we didnt really name you after a beer
5140729 he has two eyebrows there was just a little hair in between them
5140730 that is not true there was only one and it didnt go down in the middle
5140731 it was just a straight line all the way across it was kind of like a bracket on his forehead
5140732 you are a single minded person who takes pride in making sound judgements and likes to earn the respect of others
5140733 you are idealistic and can be extremely loyal and accepting of others you often remain on the sidelines in social situations choosing to observe rather than participate you are most comfortable surrounded by a group of really good friends
5140734 you enjoy being well informed and put a great deal of energy into building your understanding and knowledge as much as possible you try to be a pragmatic thinker you like to be efficient and make the most of your time
5140735 inspired by anything new and unusual you tend to look to the future and try to be open to different persepctives on life youre a bit of a connectivity junkie you use all the latest gagetry sometimes its easier than having to talk face to face
5140736 love never ends happily ever after because love has no end

5140765 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5140773 well see how keen he is on going to the sprints
5140774 there is more and different training hes more naturally suited to longer events
5140775 i think over the next four years i would like to try new events and see what happens
5140776 bob has said he wants to start fresh and do things he hasnt done before new training methods and stuff like that
5140777 we are going to look at some different events mix up the training program a little bit and do some experimenting
5140778 we have plenty of time and we will look at reinventing ourselves
5140779 we have accomplished this set of goals and i would dare to venture to say we are not going to do it again at least not like this
5140780 we will start coming up with some goals that excite him and start working toward them

5140793 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5140794 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5140795 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5140798 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5140799 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5140800 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5140801 we contend that lack of unity is the reason senator obama is in a dead heat with a 71 year old republican and no disrespect for senator mccain but age is a factor to many voters he represents the incumbent party which most of the american people are unhappy with why is it that they are tied right now
5140802 one might also call it an admission that the obama campaign is desperate to win the support of the 20 percent or so of her 18 million supporters who have been telling pollsters they will not vote for sen barack obama
5140803 the democratic party is planning a convention designed to soften the edges on the partys support for abortion rights with a revamped platform and a speaking lineup that reinforces efforts to broaden democrats appeal on the hot button issue

5140838 a debate is a head to head spontaneous structured argument over the merits of an issue
5140839 under the ridiculous 32 page contract that reads like the rules for the miss america pageant there will be no candidate to candidate questions no rebuttal to your opponents points no cross questions or cross answers no rebuttals no follow up questions thats not a debate thats a news conference
5140840 the league of women voters ran these debates with an iron hand as open transparent non partisan events from 1976 to 1984
5140841 the men running the major campaigns ended their control when the league defiantly included john anderson and ross perot and used tough moderators and formats the parties didnt like the parties snatched the debates from the league and formed the commission on presidential debates the cpd in 1986
5140842 cpd should stand for cloaking device for party deceptions it is not an independent commission on anything
5140843 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
5140844 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
5140845 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
5140846 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition

5140867 kalau hendak muzakarah juga kita tanya mereka sebab apa tidak mahu menerima islam dalam semua aspek kehidupan termasuk ekonomi dan budaya kita kena tanya mereka di mana tidak kena islam sehingga umno tidak mahu menerimanya
5140868 hanya ini sahaja yang boleh kalau kita hendak muzakarah dengan umno
5140869 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5140870 jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5140871 saya pun hairan satu pihak hendak berunding dengan umno dan satu pihak lagi hendak perkukuhkan pakatan rakyat macam mana boleh berlaku sedemikian ini menggelirukan orang ramai
5140872 kalau umno tiada di muka dunia ini orang melayu pun tidak rosak di lima negeri yang dikuasai pakatan rakyat sekarang orang melayu pun boleh hidup juga
5140873 kalau kita sayangkan umno kita keluarkan mereka daripada kegelapan yang tua tua itu biarlah sudah payah begitu juga mereka yang mempunyai duit banyak biarlah

5140895 i know folks talk in barbershops and beauty salons and ive heard some folks say that barack he seems like a nice guy but im not sure americas ready for a black president
5140896 weve heard those voices before voices that say maybe you should wait you know you cant do it its the bitter legacy of racism and discrimination and oppression in this country
5140897 i know its also about love i know people care about barack and our family
5140898 race man how barack obama played the race card and blamed hillary
5140899 dr kings dream began to be realized when president johnson passed the civil rights act
5140900 we have to be very very careful about how we speak about that era in american politics
5140901 a black man needed the help of a white man to effect change
5140902 senator clinton made an unfortunate remark an ill advised remark about king and lyndon johnson i didnt make the statement
5140903 i havent remarked on it and she i think offended some folks who felt that somehow diminished kings role in bringing about the civil rights act she is free to explain that but the notion that somehow this is our doing is ludicrous
5140904 theres no question that theres politics here at work too
5140905 it helps obamas campaign to push these issues into the fore in a place like south carolina
5140906 folks are beginning to wonder is this really an isolated situation or is there something bigger behind all of this
5140907 resorted to distasteful and condescending language that appeals to our fears rather than our hopes i sincerely hope that theyll turn away from such reactionary disparaging rhetoric
5140908 it was an historical fact an affirmation of the obvious
5140909 who did the fake clip with kantor saying the n word its the definition of a dirty trick and from what i can tell all the youtube links have disappeared
5140910 i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it
5140911 i have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on
5140912 that found how sen obamas support among working hard working americans white americans is weakening again and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me
5140913 however it was not until clintons supporters began to express their grief and anger that i heard some of the egregious things both said and done
5140914 on more than one occasion i have walked into a courtroom in rural counties only to have the bailiff yell at me to get behind the rail apparently unaware that lawyers look like me
5140915 well maybe they just refused to believe that a professional attorney would show up in court dressed like a washer woman

5140917 of elderly women whose pension and social security checks cant stretch enough to cover food medication and rising utility bills

5140925 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5140926 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5140927 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons

5140936 your average american is going to have a hard time seeing the iraq war as morally equivalent to the one in georgia let alone even less justified but that is simply because he or she is american the rest of the world has no such problem and never has an invasion of a sovereign state is an invasion of a sovereign state pure and simple

5140946 people like to manage what they dont have thats why theyre poor by borrowing for stuff they cant afford during that year as a taxi driver i learned to manage what i had and i was actually better off earning p350 a day than earning p50 000 a month because now i learned to manage my money
5140947 i ask people do you want to prosper what do you have you may not have money but you have time not just time but time to learn so use that join an insurance company and be an agent or join a company and sell their product the important thing is to learn and from there branch out dont get a job to earn money get a job to learn and dont start a business to earn money get into a business to learn the money will follow
5140948 some people start a business and want to earn right away but thats not wise starting a business is like a slingshot you have to pull back that means clearing the way take time pulling back because when its time to release youll be surprised that your business will rapidly shoot towards the target
5140949 i pass it on to people who can do a better job i make them part owners thats why i can own many businesses

5140968 astronomers have wondered for a quarter century whether these voids were too big or too empty to be explained by gravity alone
5140969 our analysis shows that the voids in these surveys are exactly as big and as empty as predicted by the standard theory of the universe
5140970 void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys does halo occupation of field galaxies depend on environment
5140971 we wanted to see whether something strange is happening to the dark matter halos in the regions where we dont see galaxies
5140972 maybe the halos are there but they just dont manage to form stars then the voids would look emptier than they really are because they dont have anything our telescopes can see
5140973 when we used galaxies brighter than the milky way to trace structure the biggest empty voids we found were about 75 million light years across
5140974 red galaxies are made of old stars while a lot of the light in blue galaxies comes from young stars
5140975 halos of a given mass seem to form similar galaxies both in numbers of stars and in the ages of those stars regardless of where the halos live
5140976 void galaxies are different from typical galaxies in more crowded parts of the universe
5140977 the void galaxies are fainter bluer and are forming more stars but these differences may arise because these vast rural stretches of the universe contain lower mass halos than the cosmic cities and suburbs where most galaxies form

5141022 pakistan lacks any institutional checks that could help maintain oversight over isi operations
5141023 there is evidence implicating the isi in large scale attacks in both afghanistan and india
5141024 isi and pakistan army had been working to send islamist militants into indian kashmir a process that led to short kargil war in the summer of 1999 the same year in which army chief gen pervez musharraf a key figure in pakistans kashmiri islamist militant project came to power in an october coup
5141025 to begin aiding these groups indigenous rising and cultivating kashmir specific islamist militant groups
5141026 until now the bush administration never directly criticised the directorate and other institutions within the army instead relying on
5141027 should things get out of hand it is not beyond the pale that washington could officially designate isi as a terrorism supporting entity along the lines of the october 2007 us executive order against
5141028 right hand does not know what the left is doing
5141029 while there are those within the isi who see militants as valuable tools in the states foreign policy objectives there are many others who went native and developed sympathies for these islamist militants even adopting the islamist ideology of the people who were supposed to be their tools
5141030 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently

5141054 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
5141055 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed

5141096 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
5141097 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
5141098 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad this limits the use of americas power especially its capacity for military intimidation never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization

5141113 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5141114 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5141115 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly
5141116 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5141117 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5141118 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5141119 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5141120 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5141121 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5141122 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5141123 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5141126 i probably would have been in track or cross country or perhaps basketball
5141127 my dad may have spent more time doing basketball with me
5141128 it was a very competitive swim team and i remember we had two and three hour workouts
5141129 that inspired us so we came back and started competitive synchronized swimming in minnesota
5141130 i think the competition was fierce and we all wanted to win and we did
5141131 and i think we learned the kinds of things people learn from being involved in competitive team sports
5141132 i think the bar has been raised a lot since then
5141133 synchronized swimming is more highly respected around the world than it is in the united states where it started
5141134 in japan and russia and china swimmers are like movie stars they are in the news constantly
5141135 somehow i cant believe that there are any heights that cant be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true this special secret curiosity confidence courage and constancy and the greatest of all is confidence when you believe in a thing believe in it all the way implicitly and unquestionable

5141164 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5141165 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms

5141169 i reckon the mcg surface might need to get better because its the worst i have seen it
5141170 we are in round 20 and there was enormous talk about the telstra dome surface three or four years ago but telstra dome is miles better than the mcg at the present time
5141171 i dont know when they are going to re surface it but it needs addressing
5141172 we will do our normal re turfing going into the finals so you will see a significantly different mcg when we start the september action
5141173 we usually look at what we need in terms of new turf going into the finals and then do it in that week leading up from the last home and away game to before the first week of the finals
5141174 as we know it is winter it is wet and a little bit soft so it is a bit different to normal
5141175 but if you compare the ground to what it looked like in the 80s and even the 90s it looked a hell of a lot different then to what we are playing on today
5141176 i think telstra dome is looking good but i dont compare them that way the question is are we providing a good and safe workplace and yes we are
5141177 we have set such a high benchmark with the standard of the playing surface here and at telstra dome and one shouldnt

5141202 what we want to do is make the experience of remembering as simple as possible
5141203 there are endless things from that standpoint of any service you might be inspired to interact with when youre not by your computer
5141204 theres plenty of free programs out there and a lot of them are really good
5141205 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5141206 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5141207 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5141208 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5141209 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5141210 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5141211 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5141212 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5141213 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5141214 people have been given the power to create their own movies and share them and its opened the gates for other forms of media
5141215 a lot of people enjoy playing games and theyre excited by the idea of making games but they dont know how to go about it
5141216 the desire has been there for a long time but its only now the technology is making it easier to put the power into peoples hands
5141217 its empowering people it makes people feel they made something cool
5141218 what is unique is we do it in a way the casual audience can be the game designer with boom blox anyone can get in there and create
5141219 the games are so huge and expensive these days and theres only so much game you can give a consumer so it makes sense to expand it out to a huge audience of people
5141220 even if only 1 percent of players get into creating thats a ton of content you can offer that extends the life of the game
5141221 it remains to be seen if this will work there hasnt been a game that gives you this much freedom to create and share
5141222 heck if he can go win gobs of gold medals i can keep pushing myself for less than a mile to run faster than i thought i could
5141223 running has taught me that the pursuit of a passion matters more than the passion itself immerse yourself in something deeply and with heartfelt intensity continually improve never give up this is fulfillment this is success
5141224 the problem with the older demographic is that they really dont want that much new stuff
5141225 people tend to stick with formats that they are comfortable with
5141226 its very much the whole its not just one thing
5141227 people who used to listen to radio still listen to radio
5141228 while they want to be cool its more important that they have a trusted place to go

5141248 on the other hand at headquarters we will have three people rather than two because of the extra person sent from station 3 our goal is to be on scene within four minutes 95 percent of time i dont think thats going to change from a statistical point of view the reason we chose station 3 is because it has the lowest call volume and the lowest call volume at night which will have the lowest impact
5141249 i think 12 is too young to be in the olympics
5141250 but after that it is about talent if an athlete is good enough why not
5141251 even in little league if a kid is trying different pitches like a curve ball their arm is still developing
5141252 it goes against the way their bones and muscles are growing and the movements can be harmful
5141253 physically athletes will not reach their full potential until 18
5141254 before that it is about learning the fundamentals and improving on the basics
5141255 if a kid starts young and it becomes a job for them is it fun anymore do they still have that desire
5141256 if sports are taken too seriously at such a young age it can break hearts
5141257 sports are a part of growing kids should just have fun with them
5141258 i think that if the chinese womens gymnastics team really is younger than they claim their gold medals are even more of an achievement
5141259 if they lose at the olympics emotionally it could be really bad
5141260 it takes a lot of travel time intense training and time away from family to compete at that level
5141261 they can bend and twist in ways that even 16 year olds cannot
5141262 it varies from sport to sport but older athletes have better skills and experience
5141263 the intent is to come up with a set of criteria to use citywide to come up with something a little more uniform throughout
5141264 its six of one a half dozen of the other because they would still need a special permit as long as we have some oversight control

5141279 during the recent retail price increases by supplier companies the lack of transparency around the profitability of their supply and generation arms has led to confusion in the media and among the wider public
5141280 how can a company which has been making good profits overall be justified in increasing its retail prices even with record commodity prices
5141281 my view is that the lack of transparency as to the accounts of our major energy supply companies is potentially problematic both in terms of the reputation of the industry itself and in terms of good policy making
5141282 i would be particularly interested to hear your views on the merits of requiring vertically integrated energy companies to report the accounts of their supply and generation businesses separately

5141366 nick punto was our waiter and he kept going can you believe how bad im doing hes just a really nice guy they all are and theyre all just such regular guys not stuck up athletes

5141374 el viaje de nuestro jomer the mysterious voyage of homer
5141375 time for a controversial statement that will get me dugg down
5141376 russias attack on georgia has sparked fears across the young democracies of eastern europe that moscow is once again hungry for conquest
5141377 redefining certain forms of birth control as abortion is an unreasonable interpretation of basic contraception and family planning
5141378 over 98 percent of all american women will use contraceptives at some point in their lives assuring access to safe affordable and reliable forms of family planning is sound public policy
5141379 any of the various procedures including prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
5141380 if so what have you done and what will you do to ensure access to it
5141381 barbaric and inhuman practice and a violation of girls and womens rights
5141382 which goes back to our ancestors and therefore it has to be respected
5141383 in most societies fgm is considered a cultural tradition which is often used as an argument for its continuation
5141384 fgm reflects deep rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women
5141385 such dialogue should respect cultural differences but also womens dignity and aboriginal womens right to sexual satisfaction which transcends ancestral traditions
5141386 what games am i involved in here and do i really want to play them

5141392 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5141393 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5141394 we were able to image dark energy in action as it stretches huge supervoids and superclusters of galaxies
5141395 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
5141396 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
5141397 dark energy sort of gives microwaves a memory of where theyve been recently
5141398 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them
5141399 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5141400 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5141401 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5141402 weve had a fortunate two years but for all of us who were here the memories of 2004 and 2005 are still fresh
5141403 now is the time for floridians to take the steps necessary to prepare should fays track bring her over our state this week
5141404 we hope that this storm does not turn into a hurricane and if it does that the damage is minimal
5141405 it was kind of weird because i didnt really know what to get so i just got a lot of stuff
5141406 we feel really confident we practiced really hard and were just going out there to have fun
5141407 just the disco era so no no professional experience unlike katie who has eight years so her training was good
5141408 we started off learning the basic steps and teaching jason where to look and do this and weve done a lot of partner work just to get comfortable with each other
5141409 hopefully well be going with the park that were really stoked about itll be a great design itll bring people to kirksville and make them want to come back to the park which is what were looking for a good skate park for skaters designed by skaters for skaters
5141410 to supply to those who have made lasting contributions to gospel music emergency assistance in times of financial need
5141411 was founded by the late herman harper former member of the oak ridge boys and president of the harper agency a major booking agency for gospel artists
5141412 a need is identified usually by someone who is aware of a crisis a request is made in writing to the gmtf for financial assistance an immediate investigation of the need is made by the trustees and if it meets the criteria set forth by the gmtf a check is issued and usually sent directly to the hospital physician funeral home etc
5141413 it will focus more on the relationships between people caught in the disaster
5141414 deborah if you werent so smashed to death under that fucking slab id marry the shit out of you

5141416 damn it that was the joke i was searching for
5141417 both coking coal and thermal coal are in short supply in china
5141418 the situation this year has become the most severe in history
5141419 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5141420 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5141421 tehran afp iran said it had launched a rocket carrying a test satellite into space on sunday in a move that could further exacerbate tensions with the west over its nuclear drive
5141422 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5141423 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5141424 oh all you have to do is diet and exercise and you will lose weight
5141425 i can still eat two bowls of ice cream or a whole bag of chocolate i still do that but pretty much the rest of my diet is healthy
5141426 i see all these girls that are skinny and theyre so short and petite
5141427 we just want that and were jealous im not as petite and i feel the pressure
5141428 there was need for some reason to keep up with her but it went beyond that at a certain point
5141429 when life feels out of control you find the one thing you believe you can control
5141430 the college is seeing a lot more students coming in with mental health issues in general and eating disorders is one of those issues
5141431 a lot of patients say they had issues with eating at 10 11 12 right around when the body is changing
5141432 they have had eating disorders for a long time but there wasnt a lot of treatment available when they were first starting out in their disease
5141433 it really has to be a team a dietitian nutritionist and a primary care doctor and therapist
5141434 it has become a coping strategy for something that has been painful
5141435 they have to challenge themselves every day with recovery and eating
5141436 in our country we have a narrow definition of beauty that most of us dont fit
5141437 so women go to extreme means to try to fit into that
5141438 body image in general is always an issue for women and girls
5141439 theres a lot of comparing among young women and young girls and i think along with the media what we think is normal is extremely skewed
5141440 i want to see average girls just in the middle that are just healthy they eat what is right for them to eat
5141441 when a person has a sense of self worth the exterior becomes less important
5141442 doesnt this strategically placed pasta scarf make you want to order a marcato brand pasta machine
5141443 the price of maine soft shell lobsters are down but that happens every year
5141444 the hard shelled canadian lobsters are about 3 more the same difference in price there always has been between the two types
5141445 you start with a charcoal fire and then add wood apple and hickory
5141446 we support places like madonna house in norwich sometimes individual families throughout the region
5141447 and we used two gallons of gas we first hooked up with the bozrah group about 12 years ago and we always have a good time
5141448 when the owner spoke to me what he said made sense
5141449 so were going to have something they havent seen up north
5141450 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5141451 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5141452 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5141453 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5141454 while we have never participated in the subprime or alternative real estate market some of our members have loans of this nature from other financial institutions and have been negatively impacted by current economic conditions and certainly most southern california homeowners have experienced significant declines in their home equity as a result many are having difficulty meeting their consumer loan obligations
5141455 9 11 to bring 5 000 people to the big apple see
5141456 i was late for the game because id had one of my own
5141457 as soon as i got there my brother scored a touchdown on a very long run
5141458 lets just say hes a much better student than i ever was
5141459 i dont think ive ever beaten him even in a video game
5141460 you could say im slightly limited in athletic ability im fat and i cant jump
5141461 i cant even begin to tell you how pleased i am with marcus
5141462 hes got great speed and it seems like every day he gets more confident with himself
5141463 i remember doing cone cuts one day and i started backpedaling like a defensive back
5141464 i spent two years figuring out how to be a wideout and now i was learning something new again
5141465 been talking in the coachs ear since the middle of last year
5141466 dont buy for a second that hes living in my shadow
5141467 hes so different and so much better in everything he does than i ever was and now hes the only
5141468 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5141469 what in the world is that ancient custom i dont understand that
5141470 the guy i bought it from kept it in the garage for 19 years and never washed it with a hose
5141471 if we were doing any deal like that then we would have appointed outside advisers
5141472 you always look at acquisitions and its about how compelling the acquisition opportunity is certainly we would look at all opportunities we have done that in the past and we will continue to do so in the future
5141473 hey are you feeling sensuous sence you was up get me another beer
5141474 these changes to the asia pacific organization will strengthen partnership between geographies and businesses
5141475 it will leverage local expertise and thinking eliminate management layers and provide growth opportunities for our best people
5141476 pide justicia cuando ella ni siquiera es capaz de conducirse legalmente
5141477 sexy twinkle in her eye and a british stiff upper lip
5141478 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved videogames was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character
5141479 the worlds of gaming and film are getting ever closer and as an actress i wanted to explore this exciting new area of drama broaden my acting skills and continue the active outgoing side of my personality that i showed in im a celebrity get me out of here
5141480 as long as your money is fully protected by fdic insurance you can spend your time worrying about other things
5141481 if their banker is worth anything they should be able to explain the financial stability of their institution and give them the comfort level of their money and how their accounts are titled
5141482 but they also know how to deal with the problems
5141483 i dont think its a situation where were going to have massive banking panic and massive banking failures
5141484 i think its risky to rely on arbitrary rating sites as a measure of whether your bank is going to be here
5141485 our rating is more of a stockholder rating would you want to buy our stock based on when were going to start making money if it was three years from now and we were still losing money that would be a concern
5141486 most of what we do is commercial loans for businesses and commercial real estate developers
5141487 youd have to have a ton of loans go bad in a very short period of time and the collateral that backs those loans would have to be worthless
5141488 we raised 250 million in capital as a cushion to this environment that were in
5141489 you could be criticized by stockholders for not putting more of the capital to work in the good times but during times like this it makes us look brilliant
5141490 claro que eu rodrigo vou ter meus preferidos at porque entendo e gosto de m sica mas vou guardar para mim ningu m vai saber
5141491 i got to get to petco i got to get to petco
5141492 apparently im more spoiled because i have more stuff than he did
5141493 its not that one student coming to move in its a family affair
5141494 they have a nice sized room so they dont seem to be too worried about it
5141495 its much like what kindergarten teachers tell us when we drop our kids off
5141496 you get rid of a bunch of the people peddling and it takes a while but new dealers will take their place
5141497 people sometimes on the verge of getting clean going into detox or rehab may actually make the decision to do that
5141498 from what ive seen that used to be a pretty active area
5141499 i dont know if police had anything to do with it but i havent seen much going on over there
5141500 i became filled with a grand sense of protection surrounded by the collective goodwill of so many mighty souls
5141501 melissa why do you even want to take this class
5141502 for 10 minutes i liked back to black winehouses 2006 album
5141503 but when i read the lyrics i thought it was sad i would like to invite her here i feel sympathetic to people like her she could stay a week or two and discuss the big questions of life faith might be an answer for her
5141504 i was going to the concert on the way to the concert the plane went down and it killed lead singer and band founder ronnie van zant that messed up my three day pass from the army
5141505 it was definitely nice i wish it was a little longer though
5141506 i remember sitting in my living room and just crying just really feeling for the people who were involved
5141507 now weve been given the opportunity to be a part of the rebirth of new orleans how often do you get a chance to contribute to something like this
5141508 ultimately its my responsibility to make sure that you get to college
5141509 youre a sixth grader and im standing in your living room telling mom that if she will allow you to stick with me until 12th grade you will be accepted to a four year university
5141510 if you work hard and i work hard well get you there
5141511 is that fair are you ready to sign and shake and be officially welcomed to miller mccoy
5141512 this is different yall are taking time with these kids
5141513 i said blazers ive never seen any kids running around in blazers except at st augustine
5141514 and thats where you pay to go to school this is a public school and they wear blazers and ties i want that for my son i do i really want it for him i know he can do it
5141515 i think that when we get it right we will transform education for the nation for urban schools everywhere
5141516 we have an opportunity here to create a model that works so we can say to other schools other districts and other cities and states this is what we should be doing this is how we give all students a quality education
5141517 but whats clear to me is that it can only get you so far if you create a system where initiative and creativity is valued and rewarded then youll get change from the bottom up if you create a system where people are told what to do and how to do it then you will get change from the top down weve been doing top down for many years in louisiana and all we have is islands of excellence amidst a sea of mediocrity and failure
5141518 the circumstances call for a coherent strategy not just a round of do gooding
5141519 but if theyre still failing after you support them then you pull the plug and bring in a new provider or an experienced provider over a period of 5 or 6 years 10 at the most well have nothing but high quality operators in our city
5141520 community members believe that in the current system a select group of students has the opportunity to attend high quality public schools while the vast majority of students for the most part poor and minority students are stuck in low performing schools in which they have little opportunity for growth and development
5141521 the r s d becomes an instrument that evaluates existing schools supports existing schools recommends the closure of schools and recommends the best operator to come in and take over or the best operator to come in in place of that school we put people in business and we take people out of business
5141522 the fundamental issue in american education i say this after 40 years of having read and studied and written about the problems is one that is demographic
5141523 if you dont buttress whatever happens in school with social and economic changes that give kids a better chance in life and put their families on a more stable footing then schools alone are not going to solve the problems of poor student performance there has to be a range of social and economic strategies to support and enhance whatever happens in school
5141524 it would be convenient to say that its a whole lot of other people who need to be part of the equation
5141525 but we have the job and we have to do something
5141526 if we want to really get kids to the level that we want to get them
5141527 and we want to do it in a more efficient and effective way then we would be well served if we took care of those kinds of problems if we provided more resources to kids from conception to early childhood if we took care of mental health issues and physical ailments and teeth and eye examinations including you know where these kids go home to sleep at night ive lived in this community a long time and i cant imagine how i could ever feel comfortable in neighborhoods that these kids live in at night and yet they do and we still expect them to do well
5141528 so now can i solve all those problems tomorrow afternoon can i even get the attention of the people who have control over those things right now in new orleans after katrina the answer is no i cant but i cant take the position that i cant succeed unless i have those things i have to take the position that were going to do it in spite of that now will it be hard will i be less successful probably yes but i have to take that approach because i dont have really any other cards to play
5141529 if you want to get these schools from awful to good you dont really need to put out much money
5141530 but if you want to get them from good to great you have to start spending some money and thats where i think we are in the recovery school district weve got to get our schools from awful to good and weve got to get there on the money that weve got knowing damn good and well that it aint enough but if i can get them from awful to good then i can command more money so i can get them from good to great and i can command other resources and other partnerships with these other people who need to be at the table
5141531 they always showed us the easy way to get through something
5141532 how to get around it thats why i think so many people are struggling now schoolwise before the storm we mostly had teachers just really trying to keep us in high school no teacher was talking to us about college but now they are theyre mostly trying to get us out of high school and into college now
5141533 we tried to get over on her but she always cracked down
5141534 she was always there for us always telling me ronnie do your work ronnie what college are you going to ronnie did you call the university i was like i finally got a teacher that really cares about me
5141535 for me just stepping outside the door of my house means i am taking the risk of seeing death
5141536 miss schmitz showed me that theres a lot more to the world than this
5141537 if it wasnt for miss schmitz i wouldnt be going to college now
5141538 so if were now in a position where 20 or 40 or 50 percent of kids in new orleans are attending good or even competent schools
5141539 of course the folks down there are the last people to plant their flag on improving things for 30 percent of the kids
5141540 theyre all world changers theyre all straight from the great society thats great and im glad theyve got huge ambitions but the problem is that if they fall somewhat short of their goals it will be very easy for critics of charter schooling or critics of vallas or critics of new leaders for new schools or teach for america to seize on the fact that we havent seen 100 percent of students served in the way wed like and to then try to impugn the entire set of reforms
5141541 right now a lot of people believe that you just cant succeed with some kids
5141542 he had this idea in mind where we have to have a dual track system a track for the kids who are going to make it and a track for the kids who arent going to make it
5141543 theres an assumption that there is a group of kids who wont make it
5141544 but theres no real alternative the reality is that we have a window of opportunity to innovate and to take risks that other places in the country dont have but if within a matter of years we arent able to produce the results that window will close so we need to maximize this moment to do the work that should have been done a long time ago
5141545 no one tells me how long my school day should be or my school year should be
5141546 nobody tells me who to hire or who not to hire i can hire the most talented people i can promote people based on merit and based on performance i can dismiss people if theyre chronically nonattending or if theyre simply not performing
5141547 when i hear the stories of why theyre joining us in new orleans it is really powerful
5141548 they just deeply believe that what were taking on in the education realm is feasible
5141549 the test scores in new orleans may have been higher this year than they have been in 10 years
5141550 but the reality is that theyre not nearly as high as they need to be
5141551 i mean that sort of goes without saying but we have to start somewhere

5141564 this is a problem where you have an age limit there is a temptation for manipulation
5141565 there are ways of establishing the age or the suspected age of that person but it is not absolutely scientifically correct it can be plus or minus one or two years it can also be manipulated by the way they take certain substances

5141574 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5141575 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5141576 i dont believe that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence and thats been the main reason for our policy of employing wild animals as librarians
5141577 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5141578 rubbing feet on the carpet and touching a door handle
5141579 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5141580 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5141581 once i found a woman who was nine months pregnant but did not have a birth allowed certificate according to the policy she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery in the operation room i saw how the aborted childs lips were sucking how its limbs were stretching a physician injected poison into its skull and the child died and it was thrown into the trash can i was a monster in the daytime injuring others by the chinese communist authorities barbaric planned birth policy but in the evening i was like all other women and mothers enjoying my life with my children t o all those injured women to all those children who were killed i want to repent and say sincerely that im sorry
5141582 china has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy the country could offer its experiences and special expertise to help other countries
5141583 the unfpa firmly believes and so does the government of the peoples republic of china that their program is a totally voluntary program
5141584 in strictly quantitative terms it was the most successful family planning policy ever developed
5141585 supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization
5141586 regrettably the prc has in place a regime of severe penalties on women who have unapproved births
5141587 unfpas support of and involvement in chinas population planning activities allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion therefore it is not permissible to continue funding unfpa at this time
5141588 china continues to employ coercion in its birth planning program including through severe penalties for out of plan births unfpa continues its support and involvement in chinas coercive birth limitation program in counties where chinas restrictive law and penalties are enforced by government officials
5141589 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5141590 luckily i was in the stairway when the explosion hit but they didnt make it
5141591 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5141592 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5141593 the economy as a whole is in fairly poor shape
5141594 as the pace of residential development is growing and accelerating their increase in the parking supply will unleash a torrent of unnecessary car ownership
5141595 it would definitely have an effect on marketability and property values
5141596 apartments without a parking space are considerably less valuable than ones that offer a space
5141597 limiting the number of parking spaces in residential developments does not necessarily result in fewer cars on the street or fewer vehicle miles traveled
5141598 the rhetoric between america and russia is getting downright scary
5141599 the russians seem to have gone crazy are we in for a replay of the cuban missile crisis who knows what theyll do next theyre already threatening to nuke poland

5141602 his entrepreneurial background is not an aberration it is exactly what you would wish for
5141603 i think most nonprofits the ones that do what mas does are like start ups even those with 120 years of history the thing about a good nonprofit is that you are by essence generous you are always putting back giving away youre always open letting the community come in and take your assets and bring them back out by virtue of that nonprofits are a lot like start ups
5141604 i am really interested in this membership issue its just too small and i have noticed prior to coming in that the membership has been stagnant for over a decade and so to try and crack that is exciting
5141605 there has never been a time when the mas was more needed and more useful
5141606 a lot of the infrastructure that we need to grow is provided by the public and the public sometimes doesnt pay attention to it except in bad times
5141607 this color aint really that bright depending on how the light hits it
5141608 here were helping the community there you just knock out the job and go home
5141609 practically i need to make sure that that kind of growth isnt going to dilute the program and isnt going to dilute the very important sense of community that weve built
5141610 at first we were a little worried about the notion of all these high school kids with all this paint
5141611 every time he would get to bat it would just blow up but it hasnt this time
5141612 so far the knee is good and well make a decision tomorrow
5141613 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5141614 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5141615 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5141616 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5141617 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5141618 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5141619 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5141620 as a way to bridge the world of martial arts with the world of fitness
5141621 i knew right away that it was effective because i could feel it
5141622 now i walk in and im concentrating so hard on perfecting the moves that i dont even realize that im working out
5141623 i figure if i can take away a sword from another samurai i could take away a knife or a gun from someone on a city street
5141624 angelos been there before which is a huge focus factor and he has the most consistent stride pattern over the hurdles
5141625 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be a sacrifice for a great cause
5141626 the bright critics assembled in this volume will doubtless show in
5141627 i dont think so your last night of freedom was the one before you proposed
5141628 after world war ii we native people were about 800 000 from 60 000 000 we were almost exterminated here in america creator brought everything here on earth god created the heavens and the earth and we are here on earth only a few winters life is vapor comes and vanishes then we go on into the spirit world the spirit world is more real than most of us believe the spirit world is everything heaven we are all from the earth dust therefore we are all connected we are family so we must treat everyone like family

5141631 creator god a spirit of forgiveness needs to be poured out on us
5141632 one day the people from whom you have taken money will turn against you
5141633 how terrible it will be for the nation that becomes rich by doing wrong
5141634 how terrible it will be for the nation that kills people to build a city
5141635 how terrible for the nation that makes its neighbors drink
5141636 those who lived in the lands around the mediterranean sea came from these sons of japheth all the families grew and became different nations each nation with its own land and its own language this is the list of the families from the sons of noah arranged according to their nations from these families came all the nations who spread across the earth after the flood
5141637 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5141638 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5141639 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5141640 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5141641 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5141642 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5141643 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5141644 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5141645 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5141646 und das sch ne daran ist dass wir sie kyle weggenommen haben er ist so schnell unterwegs da darfst du ihm keinen spielraum lassen es ist unglaublich wir gewinnen die rennen und wir stellen uns f r den chase auf ich f hle mich st rker als je zuvor wir sind hier um den titel zu holen
5141647 wir kommen nun langsam an den punkt an dem ich pers nlich der meinung bin dass wir an jeder strecke gewinnen k nnen auch meine crew hat einen schritt nach vorne gemacht und das war lange unser schwachpunkt aber jetzt werden die jungs woche f r woche besser
5141648 in bristol haben wir vor einem jahr gewonnen und auf fontana freue ich mich wirklich
5141649 ich hoffe dass irgendwer daherkommt und sagt dass es zwischen kyle und mir ausgemacht wird das w re sehr sch n denn dann m sste ich nur einen konkurrenten schlagen aber ich glaube dass dieser chase auf eine spektakul re weise eine ganz enge geschichte werden wird
5141650 it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to dogs
5141651 no no that doesnt count lets do a real one cmon
5141652 i cant explain just how it feels the thoughts of my premature burial

5141656 imagination is the beginning of creation you imagine what you desire you will get what you imagine and at last you create what you will
5141657 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5141658 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important

5141661 in america were a frontier nation and so the idea is that just beyond the next ridge is the perfect farmland a giant oil field or an abundant supply of timber
5141662 people dont like the idea that the frontier is now closed and weve got to live within limits
5141663 but the oil we are currently producing is of organic origin
5141664 i feel that the evidence right now for the organic theory for our major economic occurrences of oil is overwhelming and the evidence for inorganic sources right now to explain our current discoveries is unsubstantiated
5141665 it may be possible to see chinese oil rigs from the shores of the florida keys
5141666 the vast oil fields off the coast of florida that american law prevents americans from developing are now being drained by the chinese government drilling in cuban waters
5141667 when youre drilling an exploratory well its a geology experiment
5141668 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
5141669 possibly the largest oil pool on the face of the earth
5141670 is expected to be one of the greatest booms in oil discovery since oil was discovered in saudi arabia in 1938
5141671 thats what is technically recoverable not necessarily what is economically recoverable
5141672 people view oil fields as these underground swimming pools of oil which they are not
5141673 the geologic conditions vary from township to township county to county
5141674 you could drill a partial well and have it bring in a half a million barrels of oil and you can drill one half a mile away and have it bring in 50 barrels of oil

5141705 we were so happy to find national neuro right in our city and have been exceptionally impressed with their visual perception therapy program for bob after only two months weve seen progress
5141706 so many places seem to want to continue to do what theyve been doing for thirty years and dont want to try anything new
5141707 im right there with bob through all his therapy and now i can better understand how the eye scans and the loss of that ability and what it has meant for bob we just cant believe so many people dont know about vision therapy
5141708 we began e stim therapy at home but then davids insurance benefits ended and that battle began
5141709 i sent them pictures of david before and after he is motivated by yard work and i sent them photos of him mowing pushing a garden cart and even raking so that they could better understand his progress brendas persistence paid off and davids insurance benefits were extended
5141710 national neuro is better than any other place weve been the therapists are great and offer understanding and support about what you are going through
5141711 one is financial and the other is to get my husband back to where he was

5141727 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5141728 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5141729 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5141760 we have reached agreement regarding gazprom financing and building the new main gas pipelines from the east of the country developing gas fields and boosting the capacity of the turkmen sector of the caspian gas pipeline to 30 billion cubic meters
5141761 both china and russia kept silent on the details of the consensus they reached on energy cooperation in the first round of their negotiation in beijing on the weekend
5141762 it seems that a shift of russias energy export policy is under way russia might turn its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia ties are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade
5141763 moscow finds the idea of coordination of gas production and pricing policy with other gas exporters to be too tempting to abandon
5141764 this forum of gas exporters will set up the global gas balance it will give answers to the questions concerning when where and how much gas should be produced
5141765 we have not only approved these agreements but have also decided to supervise their implementation

5141776 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5141777 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5141778 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5141779 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5141780 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5141781 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5141782 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5141783 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5141784 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5141785 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5141786 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5141787 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5141788 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going stay patient and work on it
5141789 i like my president to be smarter than me and i think obama is even with my masters degree
5141790 he doesnt give standard interviews politicians always fire off standard prepared answers but you can see he thinks about each question he gets
5141791 my problem with politics is you so rarely see anyone say i made a mistake or change with the times
5141792 we live in a society where things are constantly changing mccain sees so many things in black and white but our lives are in the gray zone
5141793 obama as president sends a message to the world heres the possibilities for all people
5141794 because hes half black and half white if i thought he was an idiot i wouldnt care if he was black i didnt vote for jesse jackson

5141802 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation

5141829 it was definitely special considering it was my second summer there and going from a last place team to the title

5141850 ik heb mijn wedstrijd goed ingedeeld het was niet evident zo vroeg s morgens en in baan 2 maar ik heb een snelle start genomen om vlug in de wedstrijd te zitten het is super dat we alle drie in de volgende ronde zitten na de aflossing gaan we feesten mijn tijd is niet belangrijk want ik ben door met een grote q de rechtstreeks geplaatsten krijgen een hoofdletter q achter hun naam toen ik zag dat ik veilig zat heb ik een beetje ingehouden maar niet te veel want je weet nooit de reeksen voor mij heb ik niet bekeken want anders begin je te rekenen en ik wilde mijn eigen race lopen
5141851 zelfs als ik niet in de halve finales had gezeten ik heb geprobeerd mijn eigen wedstrijd te lopen maar 50 meter van het einde dacht ik dat ik tweede lag en heb ik gedurende een paar meters wat meer ontspannen misschien heb ik daar een honderdste verloren waardoor ik niet rechtstreeks geplaatst was ik was heel nerveus ik heb ook niet geslapen voor middernacht en ben nog enkele keren wakker geworden goed dat de halve finales s avonds geprogrammeerd staan
5141852 maar 9u00 s morgens is wel heel vroeg ik begrijp niet waarom ze de 400 meter op zon uur programmeren ik heb wel geslapen maar niet ideaal bovendien moest ik in de eerste reeks lopen dus die die na mij komen hebben meer rust gehad ik eindig heel dicht bij de derde plaats die recht geeft op directe kwalificatie maar in zon wedstrijd als deze speelt de ervaring nog mee denk ik

5142089 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5142090 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5142091 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons

5142108 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5142109 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5142110 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5142111 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5142112 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period
5142113 i could not buy a house and so i think indian democracy is faulty
5142114 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed

5142123 music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent
5142124 ben mauk myself and everybody else here will not go down that road
5142125 thats ludicrous to even think that we would put him on the field and put our football team in harms way
5142126 the ncaa denied mr mauks request even though a virtually identical request was recently granted to another student athlete in denying mr mauks request the ncaa held mr mauk responsible for the lack of information contained in his medical files while at wake forest university even though mr mauk had no control over those files in the absence of those records the ncaa failed to fully consider other relevant contemporaneous medical evidence of mr mauks injury the ncaa also made its decision without affording mr mauk the opportunity for an oral hearing an opportunity provided for in the ncaas regulations the ncaas actions are breeches of its contractual and fiduciary duties it owes mr mauk its application of its rules to mr mauk is arbitrary and capricious

5142128 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being c p at everything with no discernible talent
5142129 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia
5142130 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
5142131 in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements
5142132 the river swept them away as if they were driftwood

5142137 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done
5142138 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5142139 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done
5142140 we encourage the federal government to abandon these arbitrary cuts to public services and ensure there are enough staff to deliver the services that australians expect

5142180 there is a need to update the skills of local trainers as the broader constraint is the complete isolation of the agricultural university and professional community in iraq for more than 15 years
5142181 it is important to understand that india was once where iraq is today in terms of its poultry industry
5142182 india still has a long way to go in processing its poultry but the production systems have been developed with small farmers and that is what iraqi industry workers can learn
5142183 but these stories dont mean anything when youve got no one to tell them to its true i was made for you
5142184 the conclusive truth in regards to the events prior to and directly after the popular consultation in 1999
5142185 the commission concluded that indonesia also bears state responsibility for those gross human rights violations such as murder rape torture illegal detention and forced mass deportations that were committed by militias with the support and or participation of indonesian institutions and their members
5142186 we are determined to bring a closure to a chapter of our recent past
5142187 those who committed crimes against humanity throughout indonesias invasion and occupation of timor leste must be identified and prosecuted for the sake of justice for past victims in timor leste and for a future in which human rights are respected in indonesia
5142188 put a priority on rehabilitating the names of accused perpetrators over justice or compensation for victims
5142189 the process of creating the ctf did not follow the constitution of timor leste because the agreement signed by the presidents of timor leste and indonesia was not ratified by the national parliament of timor leste in accordance with article 95 3f of the timor leste constitution
5142190 is contrary to the principles of international laws which were ratified by the state of timor leste and to article 160 of its constitution which says that there must be a justice process for crimes against humanity
5142191 ctf is only one mechanism of addressing or looking at what atrocities may have happened in the country there is also something called prosecution
5142192 ive got a good buddy named kurt angle whos just an outstanding wrestler
5142193 kurt won the gold medal in 1996 with a broken neck he was unbelievable im not kidding hed actually broken his neck and still won the gold in his weight class

5142197 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5142198 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5142199 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5142200 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5142201 federal regulations require all radioactive byproducts of nuclear power plants to be disposed of in a nuclear waste repository
5142202 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5142203 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5142204 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5142205 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5142206 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said
5142207 the resources sector was hit and its climbing back up again cmc markets senior dealer dominic vaughan said

5142211 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5142212 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5142213 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5142214 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5142215 no respectable man in his right mind would date a tramp like that

5142218 even legalized projects do not get much attention unless we do something attractive or big

5142221 we have the longest serving president who was never elected president
5142222 when it was doratots turn to move the suspects immediately started the engine and went ahead of the victim just few meters away they blocked the path which made doratot to stop then one of the suspects shot doratot
5142223 the killing of doratot is highly condemnable and unfortunately falls in the pattern manner and motives of execution targeting so called political dissenters

5142225 something i thought i would hate but turned out nice
5142226 what if your pet canary suddenly developed a taste for blood
5142227 what do you do when your spouse dies just short of your fifty year wedding anniversary
5142228 or a writer might challenge you with a scenario where prisoners are forced to murder and burn thousands of people including friends neighbors family knowing that the same fate will eventually await them that latest is the plot from the movie
5142229 i dont feel comfortable talking to my friends about politics
5142230 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5142231 gee america has the power and can use it ill watch myself
5142232 you dont need the americans well make sure you have the capacity to secure the region well make sure that al sadr is not a thorn in your side and help your government gain control of the shiite regions in iraq the price is that you do not allow the americans to use iraq as a permanent base and instead you demand they leave relatively quickly

5142241 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
5142242 to be honest everything was going really good up until i travelled over here and i ended up getting a really bad flu
5142243 i thought i was over it but obviously it took a lot more energy out of me than i thought
5142244 i just didnt have the enerey for the last 100 i didnt close the way i wanted
5142245 i was relaxed and in control and thats what the plan was its the biggest atmosphere i have been in i let the crowd really energize me and bring me home i think i ran that about 75 per cent
5142246 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5142247 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5142248 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5142249 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5142250 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5142251 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5142252 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5142253 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community

5142256 the hustler out there in the ghetto jungles has less respect fro the white power structure than any other negro in north america

5142269 we really want wyatt to have these memories and know that we are all keeping his mothers memory alive
5142270 we need to do this in memory of jen and in effort to help others who suffer from asthma hopefully we can help make people aware of how serious asthma is and save lives
5142271 as her mother i watched her struggle with her breathing on many hot humid game days but she never gave up
5142272 when her son was born she had a constant bike riding companion
5142273 she bought a baby carrier for her bike and off they went she was a great mom
5142274 jen and her phi mu sorority sisters had a very special bond that you dont find very often
5142275 they were very religious about going back to maryville at least once a year to reminisce and relive their college days
5142276 we are hoping to have this turn into an annual memory walk run for asthma
5142277 we hope that our efforts will impact as many children as possible
5142278 we would appreciate everyones support in our first jennifer shaw suhr 5k memorial walk run we would love for you to come out and join us for the walk run or donate money to the childrens mercy hospital asthma department
5142279 the university has always been extremely supportive of my military activities
5142280 and i think one reason for that is that they understand there is synergy and utility between those activities and what i teach
5142281 there were times when our family couldnt afford lights but because he loved to study he used candles and kerosene lamps
5142282 most students said they learned more from him than any other teacher
5142283 he was a dear friend and a real fighter for civil rights he was very very bright and highly intelligent
5142284 what made him a good teacher he didnt take any foolishness and he was in charge
5142285 i told you not to become emotionally attached therefore you owe me an apology
5142286 or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who practice homosexuality nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
5142287 you will no longer be among the living and your son will comeback and whatever he was in life he will be worse in death
5142288 complete evil will take over him and he will show no mercy and your captors will not show you anything accept savagery they take you someplace not of this world and it well i know little about it but once you call this number that will be it
5142289 my son was a good boy and i let him become evil just because he was brining home all kinds of money i looked the other way just because he was paying the mortgage on the house because i got to eat lobster for dinner and had nice jewelry i let him do these things and knew in my heart he was up to no good if i have to suffer for the rest of my days or suffer in eternity i am willing to do that because nothing can be worse than this feeling i feel everyday in knowing i let my son become a monster
5142290 no jesus sacrificed himself for us and i will do the same for my son i want them to die by his hands and then will i be able to rest
5142291 wat voor spannends hebben ze nog meer gedaan die dag
5142292 this guy was slick he always looked good his suits were without wrinkles and he had a wife she was stunning my boy was good and never got into trouble and on top of his job at a grocery store he mowed lawns all over the neighborhood he made good money and when this guy came into the picture he immediately went to his house and offered to mow his lawn and the man said of course and i thought was that the man whose name was ted mitchell and his wifes name was rhonda and she was always wearing something skimpy and she flirted with my like crazy in fact he got confidence and just fed off of ted and eventually he even got a girlfriend and they talked all the time then it all changed it all fucking changed
5142293 her name was tammy and she stopped returning his calls i told him it was no big deal he even worried about not seeing her as much as work
5142294 this guy was slick he always looked good his suits were without wrinkles and he had a wife she was stunning my boy was good and never got into trouble and on top of his job at a grocery store he mowed lawns all over the neighborhood he made good money and when this guy came into the picture he immediately went to his house and offered to mow his lawn and the man said of course and i thought was that the man whose name was ted mitchell and his wifes name was rhonda and she was always wearing something skimpy and she flirted with my like crazy in fact he got confidence and just fed off of ted and eventually he even got a girlfriend and they talked all the time then it all changed it all fucking changed

5142296 our travels to complete this film have been life changing
5142297 bukankah untuk menjadi caleg itu pokoknya asal terkenal soal apakah nanti saya akan memikirkan rakyat atau tidak itu urusan belakangan yang penting jadi caleg dulu mas zaman sudah berubah para pemilih sekarang ndak peduli lagi apakah seorang caleg punya integritas kompetensi dan kemampuan memimpin asal kita terkenal pasti bakal dipilih
5142298 just wanted to say thanks bro bought your dvd and it has changed my work completely not gonna lie it was hard spending 350 00 on a dvd but im glad i went through with it cause it was well worth the money ive been winning awards none stop and have gained alot of recognition lately shit just makes me look at everything in a totally different manner now and it really helped anyways just wanted to say thanks for being such an inspiration bro keep it sick and look forward to seeing more work from ya
5142299 this barrage of information is priceless 15 long years in the making from an artist who is ever changing our industry
5142300 tattooing is my life i have lived for nothing but this art form for 15 years and this is a collection of the fruits of that labor and will give the viewer absolutely everything we have discovered to date about this industry and the equipment we use
5142301 it is everything broken down into extreme simplicity but is not intended for the lazy
5142302 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
5142303 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
5142304 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
5142305 all those dubious loan requests they can be flagged by the community
5142306 those three people are with this soldier from start to finish to ensure that the soldier can get through the system without having to fight
5142307 im still high as a kite floating driving down the road trying to get to p t either that or im still half asleep and i cant wake myself up at home
5142308 theres no reason for these soldiers to be doing that
5142309 what really worries me is you got guys who got mental problems and about 75 80 over there are seeing counselors are on some kind of medication for depression or to sleep and the staff expect you to be on time everywhere you go
5142310 the wtu is broken it might be new it needs to be fixed
5142311 all of our indications at the town hall meetings we have the comments that i get about care and concerns from the squad leaders platoon sergeants do not support those comments
5142312 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
5142313 physical brutality was not uncommon during those first years at guantanamo
5142314 why during nearly 30 years of conservative ascendancy when even a democratic president said that the era of big government was over why did the greater dc area become the nations wealthiest
5142315 the reason that we have so many well funded libertarians in america these days is not because libertarianism suddenly acquired an enormous grass roots following but because it appeals to those who are able to fund ideas libertarianism is a politics born to be subsidized
5142316 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
5142317 a great encouragement for extra effort here in the next 80 days
5142318 listen rummy shes fucked im ready and the show must go on
5142319 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5142320 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5142321 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5142322 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5142323 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5142324 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5142325 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5142326 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5142327 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5142328 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5142329 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5142330 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5142331 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went with the northern hostage deal to reduce public pressure on it
5142332 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5142333 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5142334 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5142335 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5142336 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5142337 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel
5142338 let me give you kids this illustration about 2 guys in trench coats
5142339 as i thought about my failure he showed me how to get over it
5142340 if you say gluten and i do not agree you may be right
5142341 there are cereals there are breads there are pastas the difference is amazing
5142342 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5142343 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5142344 there was nothing in that field to indicate shed ever been there
5142345 luckily i was in the stairway when the explosion hit but they didnt make it
5142346 before we know it 45 countries will be negotiating with us
5142347 in a sense the u s will act as indias sherpa at the nsg
5142348 the indians will need to convince the nuclear suppliers group that it should give the same kind of international treatment in terms of civil nuclear trade to india that the united states would have just given bilaterally
5142349 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5142350 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
5142351 when i wake up in the morning i have crud in my eyes and i have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat
5142352 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
5142353 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
5142354 never run a 100 yard dash in a 90 yard room
5142355 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
5142356 one of the largest single online events in the history of the internet
5142357 i dont think theres anything more important than awakening and also knowing what your purpose is
5142358 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5142359 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5142360 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
5142361 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
5142362 we ended up opposing that amendment in retrospect i wish we hadnt
5142363 it was one of those cases where the public was ahead of the politicians
5142364 the kings heart is in the hand of the lord he directs it like a watercourse wherever he pleases
5142365 but when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is unseen
5142366 very early in the morning while it was still dark jesus got up left the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed
5142367 i saw the lord seated on a throne high and exalted and the train of his robe filled the temple
5142368 but jesus said someone touched me i know that power has gone out from me
5142369 o my people hear my teaching listen to the words of my mouth
5142370 we are the clay you are the potter we are all the work of your hand
5142371 my tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day long
5142372 fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up
5142373 the biggest problem is in the twilight zone of international jurisdictions when offenders dont come back to the uk immediately they go from one country to the next or they may stay underground in the first country where the offence has taken place we lose track of them
5142374 sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5142375 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
5142376 which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children
5142377 because he isnt trying to impress anyone he speaks his position he knows the facts and presents them he isnt trying to sound like a liberal to liberals and like a conservative to conservatives etc he is who he is and thats what he says
5142378 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5142379 john mccain has dealt with hard choices and has more maturity and competence to lead this nation than obama does
5142380 we asked them we flat out asked them did you hear any of the discussion
5142381 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5142382 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5142383 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5142384 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5142385 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5142386 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5142387 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5142388 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5142389 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5142390 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5142391 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5142392 in reality the russia georgia dispute involved a tiny ethnic enclave with deep historical ties to russia that resides in a tiny post soviet union country if russia wanted to re conquer eastern europe its an odd place to start
5142393 at the beginning of world war i cavalry units on horseback charged gatling guns
5142394 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
5142395 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call
5142396 serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
5142397 one of the great threats we face is the personal sense of grandiosity of the lead foreign hands who shape the course of our role in the world not national grandiosity but
5142398 the first probably serious crisis since the end of the cold war
5142399 this is indisputably the first such confrontation since the end of the cold war between two major powers who both posses large nuclear arsenals
5142400 it is the second of two full moons for north americans this month
5142401 iran 1 the neocons are so distracted by the new meme of russia as nazi germany theyve forgotten all about their old meme of iran as nazi germany 2 the bush administration attempting to save face as a result of its failed promises to georgia appears determined to shame and isolate the russians if they keep it up its unlikely theyll get russias continued cooperation on iran 3 the russians have every incentive now to cultivate the iranians rather than sanction them if i were the ahmadinejad id be laughing my missile photoshopping jihadist butt off right about now
5142402 2 the bush administration attempting to save face as a result of its failed promises to georgia
5142403 as you know this means that well need to cut social security benefits
5142404 im more interested right now in what promises john mccain through his campaign advisors is making to georgia
5142405 were just trying to help him out with the financial stuff and keep him from hurting himself
5142406 we should not do anything substantive in support of the georgians because it would lose us the support of russia against radical islamic terrorism
5142407 god bless the ny post which never publishes anything but gospel truth
5142408 it appears that the cynics were right arab societies cant support democracy as we know it
5142409 ukraine and russia are rather less distinct from each other than america and canada or germany and austria and russia would be in serious trouble if it lost ukraine as an ally

5142420 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said

5142441 ms tomsic and the calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers
5142442 all i could see was the blood and tissue of my dogs
5142443 reports of similar misconduct including service of warrants at the wrong address excessive use of no knock entries and other unjustified killings of family pets this has happened before and without oversight it will happen again
5142444 what saddens us most is that all too often these injustices go unnoticed by law enforcement officials and those who are victimized are forced to suffer in silence

5142473 in graphic detail the intimate amorous and sexual relationship between cutler and the plaintiff
5142474 at the time of his relationship with cutler plaintiff did not know that cutler was simultaneously engaged in sexual relationships with another man let alone with five other men and let alone that she was prostituting herself to some of them and plaintiff did not know that cutler was recording the details of her relationship with plaintiff in her blog and defendant cutler described plaintiff as among other things a committee counsel who likes spanking

5142478 climate is hot in a way that nothing else has been before

5142487 we need to collect evidence before we go to court and were not saying were going to court tomorrow but at least with the new law microsoft has to be more careful
5142488 the uptake of office is at the lowest its been in the last couple of years so while nothings put a dent in the armor at this point perhaps there is some crumbling and the opportunity for a lower priced offering to make some inroads
5142489 given its capabilities theres no indication why it wouldnt be seen as an alternative to microsoft
5142490 this is the equivalent to forcing china to pirate the product
5142491 to try and level the playing filed between western products and native products
5142492 they are understandably not happy about foreign companies owning the bulk of the software sales in their own market
5142493 local software products of any kind pay off for microsoft
5142494 once a country has its own software businesses that countrys political leaders will start to get serious about stopping piracy so microsoft might well root for evermore
5142495 the asian market represents a wealth of opportunities but i guess the bigger issue is are people going to pay for software
5142496 microsoft of course still has the lions share of the market
5142497 we dont want to compete with that for media coverage
5142498 ohio is one state along with pennsylvania and michigan where barack obama would probably be well served by some joint appearances with the clintons
5142499 democrats have a party id advantage in ohio but that wont do much for them unless the voters in their party actually vote for their nominee
5142500 after i was bitten i felt so awful i thought i had about a week left thats what spurred me on to find my way out of the jungle and back home to south wales
5142501 i slept on the floor and was forced to drink dirty brown water from a stream that ran through the jungle near the hut the only thing to eat were mangoes that grew on a tree about a mile away
5142502 there was nothing to do except wash my clothes which i did in the stream and nobody to talk to i didnt try to escape because i didnt think there was any way out
5142503 i saw a lot of snakes spiders and scorpions but i never thought id be stung by one
5142504 i got up one day and went to put my shorts on
5142505 they had been lying on the floor because i had nowhere to hang them
5142506 i felt a sharp pain something had stung me on the thumb
5142507 then i saw a black scorpion about three to four inches long run along the ground
5142508 i managed to kill it with my shoe and tried to suck the poison out of my thumb but i was too late and the poison had gone through my body
5142509 i had a blister come out on my thumb and foot and i came out in a rash i was in dreadful pain
5142510 i literally thought i was going to die i had already lost half my body weight and i felt so bad
5142511 i built a two bed bungalow just outside of pattaya for us and i never thought i would come back to the uk i had high hopes for a fresh start and a new life
5142512 initially i was retired but then i opened a couple of bars in pattaya one of which failed and one of which i sold and managed to break even on
5142513 i spent everything i had left on the bungalow and shop
5142514 but the shop failed and she left the village with her eldest son leaving me with her two girls aged 13 and nine
5142515 i really dont know where she went but she told me she was going to find work as a masseuse
5142516 i was given a mobile number at which i could reach gareth and when i got through he was so ill he could barely speak
5142517 i just wanted to get him home and my husband got straight on to the british embassy in bangkok who were brilliant
5142518 i didnt recognise him when he was wheeled out into arrivals at heathrow he looked so ill
5142519 the embassy staff had advised us to take him straight to a hospital but gareth wanted to come back to south wales so badly we drove straight down the m4 to the a amp e department at the university hospital of wales
5142520 i have absolutely nothing except two pairs of trousers and about three t shirts
5142521 i dont know how long ill be in here but when i do eventually leave ill have nowhere to live and will have to rebuild my life

5142534 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5142535 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5142536 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5142537 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5142538 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5142539 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5142540 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said

5142542 the us dollar has had a very strong rally over the past month and people are trying to profit on this long position

5142545 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5142546 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5142547 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5142548 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5142549 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said

5142553 as a result of these findings we are in the process of developing a cardiac fitness index to be released later this year that will help trainers and coaches understand how cardiac conditions impact performance of high endurance athletes
5142554 our work also will provide healthcare professionals with insight into new more effective ways of assessing and treating heart disease for the general public
5142555 i fully support the action to have preparticipation cardiovascular screening mandatory for elite athletes this will evaluate athletes before participating in sports for the purpose of identifying or raising suspicion of abnormalities that could provoke disease progression or sudden cardiac death ensuring the well being of all athletes is the iocs priority and we feel that the identification of the relevant diseases will allow clinicians to make decisions earlier on of whether a player can stay in the game or not but above all tailor their training programs to best meet their needs and ensure athlete safety
5142556 we were surprised to find that athletes who trained at the highest level with no sign of pain showed early signs of potential injury during routine scanning
5142557 weve found that ultrasound technology can highlight problems with structure and with mobility of tissues that no other examination technique can show
5142558 we train so hard as athletes that little injuries can lead to further injuries
5142559 through these routine scans we can know if we should sit out but if we know that we can keep going we can train at the highest level
5142560 if we can move toward predictive healthcare and early detection of disease we have the potential to dramatically reduce the risks of late stage disease treatment
5142561 shifting resources to develop technologies that allow healthcare providers to diagnose disease at the earliest possible stage when there can be many treatment options is better medicine
5142562 its fantastic to make the top step of the podium at last after so long knocking on the door
5142563 my team slidesports set the car up perfectly all the credit goes to them
5142564 its been great fun and im impressed by the jetta which is the first front drive car i have raced
5142565 my car was awesome in that race better than me steve gave me some trouble but he made a small mistake under braking and i was able to get past
5142566 so close and yet so far i thought that i had that race in the bag
5142567 he asked me before deployment you know my wife doesnt speak english doesnt understand the military
5142568 he pretty much asked me to watch over his family while he was gone so i did that until the day he died

5142589 there are those who talk loudly and many times those who talk the loudest are the most hurt
5142590 i stand with my arms outreached reaching into the very crevices of all of the areas where there are pockets of mistrust hate pain anger and all manner of desecration of the light of god righteously and unrighteously held
5142591 it is a vigilance that must be guarded and you must hold fast to the light
5142592 as this violet flame is released across the planet it is directed into the thoughtforms of all of the miscreation that each of these precious ones are tied into
5142593 this is why the ascended masters are ready to assist each of you
5142594 if you are in need of any surcease in the battle if there is a step on the path that seems too difficult to take but none the less you find you are forced into that situation call to me i will not turn away i cannot by law for i vowed to stay with you
5142595 there must first be the transmutation of all of the negative thoughtforms that are hovering over this entire area and over the entire planet as a weight and a burden on the lightbearers not allowing them to feel the love of god not allowing them to even feel
5142596 i tell you beloved ones it is absolutely essential for you to direct your violet flame calls throughout this planet so that each of the lifestreams that are ready for an awakening of consciousness who are ready to receive the outer understanding of the violet flame have the opportunity to feel it to know it and then to become it
5142597 your work and the work of the ages is to keep the flame and the vigil on the altar of your heart for those who are yet to be awakened
5142598 when the energies of disregard of the holy christ self in each of your brothers and sisters is allowed to run rampant there is a corresponding reaction
5142599 gentle yet tremendously positive determined and persistent is the nature of god patience which is one of the many virtues contained within the flame of mercy from on high
5142600 let us make you a perfect outpouring and outpicturing of our gentle patience with all life
5142601 for many years i have been known as the spirit of the flame of mercy and compassion i would like to speak to you about that
5142602 through the ages there have been individuals who have practiced the art of manifesting healing power and who have developed a tremendous capacity for holding a mental concept which is comparatively free of imperfection
5142603 however almost without exception you will find that when the individual who is rendering the service is removed from the earth in so called death the condition will either recur in the patient in that embodiment or remain to be transmuted into light in a succeeding earth life
5142604 those healers who render a service of a permanent nature like unto that of your
5142605 i would like to bring this to your attention today because
5142606 compassion witnessing the requirement of the moment does not allow the feelings to leave the heart flame with an acceptance of the discordant appearance
5142607 it vindicates what the site has been about and were keen to crack into the top ten and keep up the growth

5142621 the first two cars are of a different world but the gap to the quicker cars is quite a bit smaller now by the speed on the straight you can tell that the engine is a lot better after our finish in the omnitel 1000 km and a good position here i can only say we are going in the right direction
5142622 it is always frustrating when you will not see the checkered flag apparently today it was not our day we struggled a bit with the setup the guys in the 85 managed to get a much better setup and produced better and more consistent lap times in the race then also we also had problems with one of the pit stops and lost a lot of time i was quite surprised that the engine broke i was happy with the power output of the new engine configuration peter and the team did a very good job on the engine compared to the other cars we are not loosing time and it is a big step forward for us we now have to continue to work to further improve reliability to be able to score points
5142623 we did well in all free practice sessions and our performance in the race was also good i have not seen such competitive times in the le mans series gt2 class the virgo car is of a different world and porsche did well with their new ultra economic 4 0 liter engines we are competing in the top 5 and the drivers of both cars were very happy with the performance for podiums though we need to further improve our pace unfortunately the speedy car did not reach the finish

5142628 el gran temor que tenemos desde el sindicato es que despu s del gran proceso de regularizaci n que se ha llevado a cabo no se puedan renovar los permisos porque no hay ofertas laborales la incertidumbre se va a acentuar a partir de ahora y el gobierno deber adoptar medidas cuanto antes

5142636 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store
5142637 much developer frustration comes from a lack of understanding of this process or from attempts to circumvent it
5142638 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels
5142639 enterprise class projects including the linux kernel have more processes but that shows how seriously they take the project its less difficult to get code into a project if you understand the rules
5142640 i cant believe it im over the moon to have won the championship already at the penultimate race this success was made possible thanks to the car which with its balance is fantastic to drive and which came through the season without one technical hitch and of course thanks to our team who also worked impeccably the squad confirmed their great work by winning the team title after winning the le mans 24 hour race in june todays victory and the championship title are another highlight of my racing career
5142641 i pushed really hard to put pressure on jos just before the chicane i had a misunderstanding with an opponent which led to my trip into the gravel its even more annoying because our car was unbelievably good today
5142642 congratulations to jos he has earned the title he didnt make one mistake in the whole season
5142643 we would have loved to have left the championship open and taken it home to denmark still we are delighted with our third place with our lap times we were closer to the van merksteijn porsche than ever before
5142644 our car ran very well today the new four litre six cylinder engine at the rear drove excellently and our team worked brilliantly the fact that we didnt have a chance at victory was due to the tyres on such a twisty circuit like the n rburgring they didnt work optimally
5142645 the race was incredibly exhausting and the traffic was sometimes horrific but we came through and got the most out of it
5142646 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5142647 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5142648 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5142649 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5142650 it would help if we had more traffic police to act as a deterrent to stop these offences taking place before they end in death and tragedy

5142654 put those assets in the space where they deliver the cash flows they are delivering but on a lower geared footing

5142658 i have seen physical violence but its not too common
5142659 the playground these days is all about the mind and how you can have the emotional advantage over someone else rather than a physical advantage

5142663 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5142664 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5142665 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5142666 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5142667 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done
5142668 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5142669 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done
5142670 a lot of blokes are still quite bitter with some justification
5142671 when were having a hard time we think about the hard times the soldiers had before us
5142672 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic
5142673 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5142674 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5142675 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5142676 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5142677 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly
5142678 im going to do my best to make you sick
5142679 by doing it every other week we dont believe there will be any kind of significant difference but we are saving a bunch of money that could be better used elsewhere

5142684 remain s confident of growing our profitability in the current financial year
5142685 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said
5142686 growth in the australian and new zealand employment business has been driven by ongoing migration from print to online a growing presence in sme healthcare education and government markets improved yield and the introduction of product extensions through standout amp premium ads
5142687 more than 77 per cent of job seekers time is now spent on seek and over the past 12 months we have increased job ad volumes by more than our two closest competitors combined
5142688 with increased sales capability and new content partnerships seek learning had a strong second half and with continued leverage of the seek brand we expect this momentum to continue paul bassat said

5142721 adem s hay algo que se ha olvidado que es la planeaci n de desarrollos urbanos en el pa s ya que s lo estamos concentrados la macha urbana esta concentrada en una sola zona el rea del valle de m xico la zona metropolitana y eso hist ricamente es un error ya que as se han acabado las grandes culturas pues esa mancha urbana se acaba los recursos naturales de manera irracional que hay en su alrededor en lugar que s la mancha urbana estuviera dispersa se diera paso a un manejo sustentable de los recursos naturales poniendo los ejemplos de teotihuacan ciudad devastada adem s que hace menos de cien de a os 80 aproximadamente xochimilco era un lago que ahora se ha ido deteriorando nuestros antepasados eran navegantes y a pesar de ser un rea natural protegida simplemente no se quiere conservar
5142722 con lo anterior hay que dejar en claro que no nos oponemos a la construcci n de la autopista pero s queremos que se cambie el trayecto por que el actual de subidas y bajadas nos lleva a pesar otra cosa ya que se afecta se parte en dos el rea del gran bosque de agua de m xico
5142723 de origen el gran bosque de agua que son m s de 150 mil hect reas poco m s o menos de las cuales en un grado o en otro de acuerdo con sus caracter sticas han sido decretadas rea de conservaci n rea natural protegida en general de acuerdo al valor hidrol gico de absorci n de agua pluvial y por ende la carga de los mantos acu feros que abastecen del vital l quido a todo el valle de m xico est compuesto de m s de 80 por ciento por una zona boscosa as como un rea agr cola y un m nimo de rea urbana que desafortunadamente ya ha ido deteriorando la zona pero el trazo de la autopista lerma tres mar as parte en dos dicha zona no sabemos por que pero imaginamos para en un futuro hacer una mancha urbana
5142724 en esta rea de acuerdo a los estudios realizados por especialistas de la universidad aut noma de m xico que han realizado mapas de la zona para conocer a detalle del valor tanto ecol gico como hidrol gico donde se incluye la subcuenca de lagunas de zempoala las ca adas de buenavista hac a el norte en el estado de m xico la presa salazar por la zona de la marquesa ya en el distrito federal en la zona del desierto de los leones el r o san borja el r o magdalena en la zona de los d namos donde se prev una gran inversi n para sanear este r o abierto adem s de la ca ada de las regaderas que es uno de los ltimos r os a cielo abierto que existen y que en su conjunto son los cuerpos de agua que alimentan a todo el valle de m xico es decir a la ciudad de m xico la zona conurbana del estado de m xico y comunidades del estado de morelos a trav s de filtraciones pozos de agua que se alimentan de escurrimientos y abastecimiento directo
5142725 de acuerdo a los mapas que hemos realizado toda la ciudad de m xico depende de la filtraci n que existe en esta zona el gran bosque de agua por lo que debemos conservarlo no s lo y por si mismo del valor ecol gico que tiene sino por la importancia hidrol gica de abastecer a los millones de mexicanos del vital l quido
5142726 en m xico hay m s de dos mil especies de aves diferentes en el gran bosque de agua se han detectado al menos 222 especies diferentes lo que significa que la zona que buscan afectar es un punto importante que por ley ya que est decretado como rea natural protegida debe cuidarse
5142727 el parque desierto de los leones es la primer rea natural protegida decretada en todo latinoam rica fue la segunda en el mundo en decretarse as adem s de ser un rea llena de riqueza cultural con monumentos el gran bosque de agua es un rea tambi n decretada rea de conservaci n por su riqueza natural y ahora simplemente buscan pasar por encima de la ley y la quieren partir como ya han comenzado con las grandes desarrollos urbanos lo que se ha documentado en los estudios que hemos realizado
5142728 estos estudios documentados y avalados por instituciones internacionales nos lleva a oponernos no del proyecto de la autopista sino de la afectaci n que habr a la principal zona de filtraci n del vital l quido que ya comienza a hacer falta en la ciudad de m xico por lo que se deben tomar alternativas las cuales existen nosotros hemos buscado dar a conocer a las autoridades esta informaci n para que tome en cuenta v as de comunicaci n alternas en una l nea recta que no afecte la zona natural protegida que desde hace m s de 90 a os se dio el primer decreto de protecci n por lo que no debe hacerse una fragmentaci n de sta zona mucho menos una afectaci n de la magnitud que se pretende

5142730 ive won two races and darrens won the other so its been a good day for the team its a shame my weekend ended in a tyre wall i made a forceful aggressive touring car move on tom onslow cole which was needed because from where i was sitting it looked like he was under instructions not to let me past at any cost he left the door open at the hairpin and i nipped through i gave him enough room on the exit and i was off and gone when i got a big hit in the left rear its unlike tom to do that so either somethings broken on his car and thats forced him into me or hes maliciously had me off i was in front of him at the time so i didnt see but its still been a good day for the team we really understand the leon tdi now we can qualify well its got good race pace and it works well on the dunlop control tyres you can tell its a good car because the opposition is whingeing but in the last five years honda and vauxhall have both had the best cars out there so its nice to see that now its our turn mathematically we can still win the drivers title and of course well keep on trying at silverstone and brands hatch until the points say otherwise but realistically my thoughts have already turned to next year
5142731 to qualify on pole and to get both cars on the front row of the grid was a great start to the weekend but being fired off by tom onslow cole on the first lap was a very frustrating way to begin race day after that i ended up getting involved in fights i shouldnt have been involved in which resulted in another incident and me ending the race in the tyre barriers race one was a big disappointment but race two was great fun because i had to fight my way up from the back of the grid id had a good clean race with colin turkington until closing stages so i was a bit annoyed that he pushed me wide at the hairpin because it was unnecessary but at least the result gave me a front row starting position for the start of the third race i was a bit concern by the three bmws that were starting around me because they are quick off the mark but andrew jordan didnt get a great start and i managed to slot into the lead before the first corner and just paced myself from there on i was pleased to win especially for the guys in the team who work on car 12 and did a great job to repair it after the first race
5142732 we did some simulation work before we arrived at knockhill to try and find out what the leon tdi might be like around here and from that we thought the car would be very strong for the third consecutive race meeting we locked out the front row in qualifying and whilst it is a fantastic achievement to win all three races we feel slightly disappointed that we didnt maximise our full potential with such a strong performance on saturday its not unrealistic to aim for a first and second place finish in the opening two races but for various reasons we werent able to do that then jason finished the final race in the crash barriers meaning that once again only one car scored well the incidents which put darren out of race one and jason out of race three might not have been of our making but it meant that we didnt have the results we deserved this weekend

5142758 in scientific research weve realised that silos of pure science are not the way to go any more that the true advances in science come from bringing scientists from different persuasions different expertise together
5142759 thats why this will really be unique facility in australia and will stand with the very best in the world
5142760 i hope that in 50 years time when they open that time capsule therell be a great sense of satisfaction that we avoided the worst aspects of climate change because we brought scientists together

5142769 well im going to read his book which is called
5142770 just my luck i get the one not named after the guy
5142771 i guess he was out judging horses at the state fair
5142772 and these are the folks whose superior education makes them fit judges for how we live

5142774 glasswork and mosaics were fabricated in tiffanys new york studio by the womens glass cutting department headed by clara driscoll a gifted designer and artisan like most tiffany employees as the designer of many of the studios most prized and valuable lamps
5142775 in the familiar world of human artifacts gt complicated things that look designed are designed gt to na ve observers it seems to follow that similarly gt complicated things in the natural world that look gt designed things like eyes and hearts are designed gt too it isnt just an argument by analogy there is a gt semblance of statistical reasoning here too gt fallacious but carrying an illusion of plausibility gt if you randomly scramble the fragments of an eye or a gt leg or a heart a million times youd be lucky to hit gt even one combination that could see walk or pump gt this demonstrates that such devices could not have gt been put together by chance and of course no gt sensible scientist ever said they could lamentably gt the scientific education of most british and american gt students omits all mention of darwinism and gt therefore the only alternative to chance that most gt people can imagine is design
5142776 the chances of any normal human being taking the time to add incredibly valuable meta data to the great wads of digital data they create daily approximates zero
5142777 most people would prefer root canal work than the utter tedium and ambient feeling of futility that accompanies meta data creation besides everyone is too busy oh and besides that again it always seems to be more fun to create new stuff than to create stuff about old stuff

5142787 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
5142788 those are friendships which have lasted me for years and continue until this day
5142789 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
5142790 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5142791 we have an economy that frankly for the last eight years has been focused on the very few and we have not seen economic growth from the bottom up
5142792 the only way we are going to move beyond these current challenges is not to try to prevent further immigration and integration of our communities
5142793 weve got 79 days before were going to change the country
5142794 i dont need to convince this room of the nature of the changes that are needed weve got an economy that is not working
5142795 a foreign policy that has been based on bluster and bombast
5142796 we are going to go out there and run the best presidential campaign that you have seen we are going to win this election
5142797 were going to change the country and were going to change the world so keep your stress to a minimum

5142803 you always worry about hurricane amnesia i dont think thats going to be a problem though not with the emphasis that craig fugate and the team have put on this i think were going to be in good shape i know that local officials are working hard
5142804 the problem isn t with limited time its with trying to do too much in too little time or not properly accounting for problems that will arise and eat up your time unexpectedly if anything having to give too many demos regardless of whether its to people inside or outside the organization has a bigger negative impact on game development than most other single events youd think they could be anticipated known and scheduled properly but they never are and they can drop out of the sky and lay waste to a week of productivity here and there throughout the whole development cycle
5142805 it would be great to get 10 the more the better
5142806 but theyre not the only challenge iran is going to be in the mix turkey is going to be in the mix all those former soviet union countries theyre also going to be trying to win gold medals so were going to have to be ready for everybody
5142807 i really think theyre on a different level right now
5142808 their conditioning and their strength programs are very good in their technique some of the things are subtle things that i can pick up because ive wrestled for so long
5142809 the fact that they wrestle freestyle their whole life gives them an edge an upper hand in that category
5142810 we couldnt keep asking 4a schools in chattanooga teams to travel to knoxville to be able to play 4a schools
5142811 tennessee is like three different states because of its geography there was too much travel
5142812 i have had no resistance in my part of the state because our schools were so tired of driving to knoxville to play ball
5142813 it is going to save money big time plus the crowds are going to be bigger this is also going to put the old rivalries back that you had way back yonder local schools are going to play each other
5142814 the 4a football coaches if they play 5a schools in the regular season want to know what its going to take to get into the playoffs
5142815 when you add the two closest 5a schools into our 4a district which is now going to be eight schools most people figure those two 5a schools will get the two automatic berths how do the 4a schools qualify for the playoffs there are still some things that need to be worked through
5142816 even if gas gets back down to 2 a gallon i would still be for this system
5142817 the more classifications you have the more travel you have
5142818 we wanted to go back to one classification for 32 schools a 6a conference
5142819 in the end it was about winning and losing and some feeling they were not going to be on a level playing field we need to get ourselves out of the position of what is good for each school and get to what is best statewide

5142848 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5142849 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly

5142996 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5142997 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5142998 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5142999 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5143007 if you are not going to bother processing your photos raw is not for you
5143008 every time you click the shutter your camera takes a picture and saves it in a file typically a high quality jpeg
5143009 in essence raw and jpeg photos look pretty similar coming off the camera in some cases raw photos can actually look worse as they are not as sharp and contrasty by default creating the appearance that they are washed out
5143010 this is an incorrect statement raw files are just that the raw data that came off of your ccd or cmos sensor it is a file full of red green amp blue pixels of varying intensity from black to white there is no de mozaicing or any other processing of the image in the camera
5143011 had i not reviewed the old records i would never know such transactions ever existed

5143021 ill be working with you in the coming weeks to improve and foster better communications on this effort
5143022 im the chairman of the truckee meadows water authority and neither the mayor nor our city manager sat me down and briefed me on what was planned
5143023 if there is somebody to be at blame for what happened with tmwa and the way that thing went down it should be myself
5143024 the city of reno mainly mayor bob cashell approached me about this to talk about it
5143025 i talked with shaun to set up some meetings so we could discuss this shaun really wasnt keen on the idea but because of my suggestion we proceeded with it
5143026 if anyone is to blame for the thing that happened with tmwa and that going south it should be me and not shaun

5143062 this was a guy who thought he was every gift to every woman you know he was my baby
5143063 i miss the kisses i miss the hugs he always would call me on the phone and when i didnt get that phone call that day i knew something was wrong
5143064 he was living in east denver commuting and taking the light rail to his job in englewood he was making a real good effort to hold the job
5143065 i know there are a lot of people out there that have heard what happened and probably know bit and pieces of what happened and they are not coming forward
5143066 when the people came out and told me they said your son is dead you know oh gosh it was almost a flash before my eyes i cant believe that

5143072 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5143073 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5143074 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5143075 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5143076 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5143077 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5143081 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5143082 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5143083 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5143084 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5143085 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5143097 i was just doing something that you do after school
5143098 his father was so proud and so excited for him when he was in high school and breaking these records when he was growing up it was too much attention for him hes a pretty low key guy but his dad was loving it
5143099 weve talked about how special it is that he gets to experience what his father went through to watch me achieve these goals
5143100 hell say now i understand what my dad was feeling
5143101 part of why joy loves it so much is she never really got to where she wanted to in college because she had so many things going on

5143118 in the first instance i wish to condemn the actions of the prime minister of trinidad and tobago for having committed this country to certain agreements with three of our caricom neighbours without having first consulted the people and received their agreement and consent in fact such a serious matter as political integration should have been the subject of a referendum
5143119 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5143120 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5143121 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5143122 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5143123 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5143124 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5143125 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5143126 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5143127 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5143128 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5143129 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5143130 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5143131 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5143132 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5143133 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro

5143135 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership but just using the peace process as the blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5143136 the recent milf perpetuated incidents in mindanao starting with the ambush of army troops of the 5th infantry battalion by the milf troops in lanao del sur yesterday is virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority add this was confirmed by commander bravos declaration of jihad
5143137 these developments are clear manifestation of insincerity to the peace process of the significant portion of the milf
5143138 we have launched military operations in mindanao and this will go on until perpetrators are punished and normalcy is established in the area

5143141 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
5143142 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
5143143 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
5143144 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
5143145 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
5143146 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
5143147 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
5143148 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
5143149 the plan would allow many large financial companies that are currently enduring record losses to eventually receive tax breaks millions of dollars greater than are currently available to them
5143150 this is all about bailing out the subprime lending industry
5143151 said jean ross executive director of the california budget project a nonprofit that advocates for low income californians in the state budget process
5143152 they will have checks written to them by the state of california if this goes through
5143153 subprime mortgage issues remain a key factor in influencing mortgage fraud directly and indirectly the subprime share of outstanding loans has more than a doubled since 2003 putting a greater share of loans at higher risk of failure additionally during 2007 there were more than 2 2 million foreclosure filings reported on approximately 1 29 million properties nationally up 75 percent from 2006 the declining housing market affects many in the mortgage industry who are paid by commission during declining markets mortgage fraud perpetrators may take advantage of industry personnel attempting to generate loans to maintain current standards of living
5143154 that we are having a major speculative splurge as this is written is obvious to anyone not captured by vacuous optimism there is now far more money flowing into the stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it there are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute historically aware men and women to manage them i am not given to prediction ones foresight is forgotten only ones errors are well remembered but there is here a basic recurrent process it comes with rising prices whether of stocks real estate works of art or anything else this increase attracts attention and buyers which produces the further effect of even higher prices expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up the process continues optimism with its market effect is the order of the day prices go up even more then for reasons that will endlessly be debated come the end the descent is always more sudden than the increase a balloon that has been punctured does not deflate in an orderly way to repeat i make no prediction i only observe that this phenomenon has manifested itself many times since 1637 when dutch speculators saw tulip bulbs as their magic road to wealth and 1720 when john law brought presumptive wealth and then sudden poverty to paris through the pursuit of gold to this day undiscovered in louisiana in these years aslso the great south sea bubble spread financial devastation in britain
5143155 through 1925 the pursuit of effortless riches brought people to florida in satisfactorily increasing numbers
5143156 not more than three fourths of a mile from the prosperous and fast growing city of nettie
5143157 this reluctance to concede that the end has come is also in accordance with the classic pattern the end had come in florida in 1925 bank clearings in miami were 1 066 528 000 by 1928 they were down to 143 364 000 farmers who had sold their land at a handsome price and had condemned themselves as it later sold for double treble quadruple the original price now on occasion got it back through a whole chain of subsequent defaults sometimes it was equipped with eloquently named streets and with sidewalks street lamps and taxes and assessments amounting to several times its current value
5143158 he was a director to general motors an ally of the du ponts and soon to be chairman of the democratic national committee by choice of al smith
5143159 the shrewd worldly wise candidate of one of the great political parties chooses one of the outstanding operators in the stock market as a goodwill creator and popular vote getter
5143160 if smith should be elected with a democratic congress we are almost certain to have a resulting business depression in 1929
5143161 the election of hoover and a republican congress should result in continued prosperity for 1929
5143162 there is no cause for worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
5143163 some of those in positions of authority wanted the boom to continue they were making money out of it and they had an intimation of the personal disaster which awaited them when the boom came to an end but there were also some who saw however dimly that a wild speculation was in progress and that something should be done for these people however every proposal to act raised the same intractable problem the consequences of successful action seemed almost as terrible as the consequences of inaction and they could be more horrible for those who took action a bubble can easily be punctured but to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy among those who sensed what was happening in 1929 there was some hope but no confidence that the boom could be made to subside
5143164 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5143165 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5143166 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5143167 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5143168 will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are into it

5143181 wait this fight could last longer than 12 hours how do we get food
5143182 pidato tersebut lebih banyak berisi pembelaan diri atau apologi dengan membangun optimisme yang terlalu berlebihan di tengah kondisi rakyat yang semakin sulit
5143183 dapat kami katakan pidato tersebut juga tidak jujur mengakui berbagai kekurangan atau kegagalan yang telah dilakukan pemerintah dengan demikian substansi pidato tersebut cenderung hanya meninabobokan masyarakat dan masih saja dalam bingkai retorika tebar pesona
5143184 seperti krisis penyediaan listrik kekacauan program buku elektronik bagi sekolah dasar dan menengah kegagalan program energi alternatif biofuel jumlah penduduk miskin yang meningkat drastis menyusul kenaikan bahan bakar minyak bbm keterlambatan pemerintah membayar piutang rumah rumah sakit dalam program askeskin jamkesmas
5143185 itupun kelas menengah ke atas yang sudah terbiasa mengakses dunia maya sedangkan bagi siswa sekolah atau guru miskin di pedesaan atau kota kota kecil kebijakan tersebut sangat menyulitkan lantaran peranti komputer atau internet belum dapat mereka akses
5143186 sebab kenyataannya tak sedikit masyarakat bunuh diri lantaran kemiskinannya kasus gizi buruk dan kelaparan juga masih dijumpai dan jadi pemberitaan pers
5143187 apalagi berbagai survei lembaga independen memperlihatkan jumlah warga miskin meningkat drastis menyusul kebijakan pemerintah menaikkan harga bbm belum lama ini
5143188 sebab bagi fraksi kami apa artinya angka pertumbuhan meningkat jika sektor riil tetap terpuruk dan tidak mampu mengatasi pengangguran dan kemiskinan
5143189 akan tetapi bagaimana pemerintah telah menelantarkan program pengembangan biofuel tidak disinggung singgung
5143190 namun ketika banyak petani berminat dan rela menginvestasikan modal tak sedikit dalam program ini pemerintah meninggalkan begitu saja

5143241 after 78 days on the mountain i did not quite reach the summit and was exhausted emaciated and emotionally spent on the five day way back to civilisation i stumbled into a local village named korphe where the balti villagers helped nurse me back to health when i went to see the local school i saw 84 children sitting in the dirt doing their school lessons most were writing with sticks in the dirt and they shared only seven slate boards yet despite abject poverty i felt their fierce desire to have education and saw their spirits soar at that moment i realised that i had not come to pakistan to climb a mountain but to help the children build a school to honour christa

5143264 i have opponents in this race who do not want to change the constitution but i believe its a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god and thats what we need to do is to amend the constitution so its in gods standards rather than try to change gods standards so it lines up with some contemporary view of how we treat each other and how we treat the family

5143341 there are questions raised because the beach is a public place and there are questions about whether a beach is an appropriate place to have a camera
5143342 you could read this law to say that such behavior is illegal and it sets itself up for a possible constitutional attack
5143343 the issue becomes whether you can have an expectation of privacy when you are swimming nude at a public place
5143344 the concept of privacy is really diminishing technology is making privacy harder to come by

5143372 yash raj releases films with a gap of around a month or two so its just a coincidence

5143416 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5143417 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5143456 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5143457 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up

5143466 en determinadas realidades es leg timo que una persona pueda robar por ejemplo para comer
5143467 la iglesia no autoriza el hurto por una simple necesidad como se ha dicho recientemente en la prensa sino como excepci n y ante un estado de necesidad realmente apremiante
5143468 el hurto o la rapi a sino que se afirma el derecho de la persona a procurar su subsistencia de modo en que le es posible en una situaci n excepcional o estado de necesidad realmente acuciante
5143469 decir que se puede robar por necesidad no responde a un entendimiento cabal de la doctrina de la iglesia confundiendo robo con estado de necesidad lo que por cierto son situaciones y conceptos bien diferentes

5143515 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5143516 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5143517 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5143518 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5143519 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5143520 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5143521 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5143522 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5143523 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5143524 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5143525 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5143526 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5143527 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5143530 we need development that pushes out the people who dont care about the neighborhood and keeps the people who do
5143531 from our positions in these enclaves we can sever those pipelines whenever we want
5143532 you can build pipelines through georgia but we can snap them whenever we want
5143533 dont think that you could build more pipelines through georgia and theyll be safe theyll never be safe
5143534 your ideas about nabucco are futile because we can smash the nabucco system anytime we want
5143535 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5143536 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5143537 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5143538 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5143539 it would help if we had more traffic police to act as a deterrent to stop these offences taking place before they end in death and tragedy
5143540 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine

5143548 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5143549 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5143550 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5143551 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5143552 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5143553 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5143554 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5143555 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5143556 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 percent today
5143557 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5143558 i got a little lucky he moved to the other side
5143559 after that ace i felt very relaxed it was a very good sensation
5143560 it got better in the second set but it still wasnt great
5143561 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5143562 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me

5143568 i appreciate what people are doing here we need to do it a bit longer

5143570 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5143571 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5143572 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5143573 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5143574 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5143575 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5143579 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5143580 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5143581 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year
5143582 this year salmon runs are average but if grilse have good survival we hope that salmon will also have good survival and wed see more of those next year
5143583 where the freshwater habitat is good and where the stocks have been holding their own they seem to be able to rebound when conditions are good but there are still some pretty desperate situations in the southern areas of distribution
5143584 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5143585 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5143586 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5143588 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5143589 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5143590 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5143591 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5143592 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5143593 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5143594 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5143595 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5143596 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5143597 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5143598 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5143599 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5143600 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5143601 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5143602 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5143603 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5143604 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5143605 the government has squandered an opportunity to deal with cumulative impacts that were understood eight to ten years ago
5143606 the message that was coming from the alberta cabinet in particular was rapid development
5143607 its no secret that the association had some problems but theres been a fair bit done in the last few months to improve on those problems
5143608 im just disappointed that pembina would leave instead of helping from the inside
5143609 a lot of work has been done to explore different options and gather scientific input
5143610 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5143611 most committees are functioning well and the government is advancing its agenda subject to some of the compromises youd expect in a minority parliament
5143612 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5143614 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5143615 this paper is important because of the knowledge it brings about how these viruses which originate in birds can jump to humans this allows us to track and monitor the changes in the virus for public health purposes although it does not allow us to predict or prevent future forms of flu
5143616 dallas sebastian said he couldnt work without a mask on cuz he didnt wanna get caught he knows who hed get caught by but he still wore my god damn title out man who else can i put that title on that will actually be able to hold it and work and bring some value to it
5143617 man just go through your cruisers and see who you feel would be someone you would trust to hold it
5143618 fuck that shit i am not laying down to you any match you book or any story you write
5143619 he was a superb pilot the weather was fair we believe it was a health issue said nan walden a close friend of brandt and vice president and counsel for farmers investment co which owns the green valley pecan company in green valley
5143620 i need to be able to get a grip on it you know
5143621 now we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5143622 does evil exist and if so should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5143623 if i am president of the united states my friends if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice no one should be allowed to take thousands of american innocent american lives
5143624 my father wasnt in the house i have written about this there were times where i experimented with drugs and i drank in my teenage years and what i trace this to is a certain selfishness on my part
5143625 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5143626 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights

5143628 the prosecution has provided me with a draft statement of facts
5143629 ive also received a report from psychiatrist dr craig raeside that came last week
5143630 i estimate that in four weeks time we would be ready to make submissions
5143631 dreams are not the ones you see while you are sleeping but the ones that dont let you sleep
5143632 akhil promised me that he will make me and the country proud
5143633 i think our boxers are doing very well they are extremely talented i always had a feeling that they will do very well and they are doing very well lets just pray for them
5143634 i think its only fitting the state government meets the funeral expenses of the organ donor as a means of recognising the contribution people have made in saving the lives of others
5143635 doctors will not remove organs over objections from surviving family members
5143636 i think people have a choice with 20 per cent of people not wanting to donate organs lets make it so they opt out
5143637 you have the right to decide what happens to your body after you die
5143638 just having everybody travel this distance and support me it wouldnt be the same if they werent here
5143639 he was very enthusiastic i couldnt understand all the attention
5143640 i was just doing something that you do after school
5143641 his father was so proud and so excited for him when he was in high school and breaking these records when he was growing up it was too much attention for him hes a pretty low key guy but his dad was loving it
5143642 weve talked about how special it is that he gets to experience what his father went through to watch me achieve these goals
5143643 hell say now i understand what my dad was feeling
5143644 part of why joy loves it so much is she never really got to where she wanted to in college because she had so many things going on
5143645 ive coached her in the long jump which was so fun for me
5143646 shes a foot ahead of me in high school and shes only 16
5143647 she sees me with sunny and she gets a little competitive she wants to make sure im coaching her too not just sunny
5143648 she is the one who is going to pass all of us if she wants to stick with it
5143649 oh no my sister is in the front row and she is going to be mad im wearing her tights
5143650 monitor investigate and submit to congress an annual report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the united states and the peoples republic of china and to provide recommendations where appropriate to congress for legislative and administrative action
5143651 china suffers from a disconnect between the increasingly prominent position of energy issues on its domestic and foreign policy agendas and the capacity of the countrys institutions to manage the energy sector
5143652 the neas national energy administration originally referred to in the initial press releases as a bureau lack of authority over energy prices makes its task of mitigating the current electricity shortages which are partly rooted in price controls especially challenging the failure of electricity price increases to keep pace with soaring coal prices has contributed to the national power shortage because some electricity producers cant afford coal while others are unwilling to operate at a loss
5143653 the mere specter of a moe ministry of energy strikes fear in the heart of the ndrc because it would deprive the ndrc of a substantial portion of its portfolio and important tools of macroeconomic control the ndrcs aversion is shared by the energy firms who are reluctant to have another political master and afraid that a moe would limit their direct access to chinas leadership such opposition helps explain why the government was unable to forge a consensus in favor of more robust changes to chinas energy policymaking apparatus
5143654 in sum chinas new energy administration is unlikely to substantially improve energy governance
5143655 voc aperta um bot o e n s fazemos o resto
5143656 its really a fight for the soul of the profession
5143657 as psychologists our first ethical principle is to do no harm yet substantial documentation reveals that american psychologists have systematically designed and participated in interrogations that amount to torture in addition they have helped to legitimize cruel and abusive treatment in guantanamo bay iraq afghanistan and the cia blacksites
5143658 i began testing all sorts of plastic until i found my fathers record collection and then i started recycling those without his knowledge
5143659 they customers tell us theyd like a film from woody allen or they want mission impossible 3 in their frame or they want a picture of some famous actor then we will make it here and ship it to them
5143660 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5143661 this is why you and i will never be friends dad well never understand eachother and im only hear until i find my feet
5143662 estuvimos bastante cerca de lo que pretendemos hacer sabemos que tenemos que mejorar
5143663 the us dollar has had a very strong rally over the past month and people are trying to profit on this long position
5143664 commodity prices are firmer this morning and thats generally treated as a negative for the us dollar
5143665 i dont think people want to get too long on the australian dollar ahead of these minutes
5143666 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5143667 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5143668 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5143669 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5143670 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5143671 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5143672 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5143673 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5143674 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5143675 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5143676 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5143677 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5143678 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5143679 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5143680 n o certo o que ele fez acho que o atleta tem que correr pensando no tempo sempre olhando para a linha de chegada e n o para o p blico
5143681 eu larguei mal normalmente em tr s ou quatro passadas estou na frente de dois ou tr s atletas mas dessa vez tive que usar energia para correr atr s
5143682 ele est tr s n veis frente do resto o que bem estranho a biomec nica mostra que para correr os 100 m um atleta mesmo de ponta precisa de mais de 45 passos ele deu 39 a ci ncia n o bate
5143683 n o estou falando se doping ou n o cabe wada ag ncia mundial antidoping decidir
5143684 o importante n o agora a final estou saltando muito bem
5143685 vim para saltar o meu melhor se eu conseguir saltar 17 90 m estarei contente acho que com essa marca d p dio
5143686 we cant afford to make stupid mistakes like the one that led to the norwegian counter attack and subsequent penalty
5143687 we lost the ball in attack when daniela tried to do everything by herself ive even had to have a word with her about that
5143688 we created ten goalscoring chances against norway and we only converted 20 per cent of them fortunately for us it was enough
5143689 nadine is a truly great keeper but im hoping to help brazil get the better of her in this vital game whether i get on the scoresheet myself or create a goal for one of my team mates
5143690 without doubt the match against norway was our best performance at these olympics
5143691 ive been feeling these twinges since our opening game against germany
5143692 thats why i sat out the game against nigeria but im going to work hard to be fit for the semi final i dont even want to contemplate missing the match
5143693 se convierte en una suerte de escudo de protecci n para que cada uno pueda hacer lo que le da la gana incluso cometer delitos sin que puedan ser investigados y sancionados a tiempo
5143694 porque aqu no hay nada que investigar all simplemente hay que quitarles el escudo de protecci n
5143695 remember we do not talk about the roof i cant handle it
5143696 the greenhouse mafia in australia are in canberra and in full flight
5143697 what theyre trying to do is protect australias coal exports whilst at the same time denying the potential to develop sophisticated exports in manufacturing renewable energy
5143698 i think they the government must be feeling under pressure on this issue because theres not one authority which really supports the retention of this target now that the decision has been made to introduce an emissions trading scheme
5143699 its an election promise but there must be other ways that that can be dealt with
5143700 the reality is that renewable energy technology programs also drive improvements in efficiency in generation so theyre driving the price down
5143701 these programs are the very programs that ensure that our renewable energy generation costs reduce and eventually become cost competitive with coal and gas
5143702 the river swept them away as if they were driftwood
5143703 now is the moment for enjoy this moment because i am having unbelievable year nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year so i want to enjoy these moments no
5143704 for me is a dream to be in this final no
5143705 very happy for have this experience in my life no
5143706 everyone have different goals not for every player is the same important the things no
5143707 i cannot even compare grand slam and olympic games because this is just so much bigger to be an olympic champion this is the top of the career
5143708 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5143709 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5143710 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5143711 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5143712 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5143713 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5143714 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5143715 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5143716 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5143717 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5143718 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5143719 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5143720 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5143721 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5143722 with the people coming out it shows the support of the community our family it shows the investigators that the people are really still interested and it helps to motive them to continue doing a good job
5143723 it really touched this whole community to the point of we want to find an answer for the perret family cause its not fair for them
5143724 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
5143725 i like their character and how they have their own voices and personality
5143726 i was shocked and honestly appalled that these children didnt even know what a cow looked like
5143727 it teaches them just so much beyond sitting in front of a computer screen or a tv
5143728 weve almost lost a generation that does not know the connection between agriculture and what they eat every night
5143729 i love the competition i wont lie i love the competition of the whole thing
5143730 i love it the children love it and i love watching them
5143731 we defer to the prosecutor and we have every confidence that he will take the best and most appropriate course
5143732 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5143733 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy

5143743 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5143744 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5143745 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5143746 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5143747 it would help if we had more traffic police to act as a deterrent to stop these offences taking place before they end in death and tragedy
5143748 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5143749 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5143750 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5143751 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5143752 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5143753 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5143754 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said
5143755 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today

5143784 selection decisions are generally driven by financial and strategic considerations yet many organizational alliances fail to meet expectations because the cultures of partners are incompatible
5143785 the degree of culture fit that exists between combining organizations is likely to be directly correlated to the success of the combination
5143786 lead to endless energy and time consuming debates futile talk that produces a lot of heat and prevents the company making the decisions it has to
5143787 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5143788 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing on the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5143789 with that in mind we will be looking to try a few different things in the match against south africa on tuesday night
5143790 the us dollar has had a very strong rally over the past month and people are trying to profit on this long position
5143791 commodity prices are firmer this morning and thats generally treated as a negative for the us dollar
5143792 i dont think people want to get too long on the australian dollar ahead of these minutes
5143793 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5143794 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5143795 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5143796 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5143797 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5143798 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5143799 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5143800 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5143801 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5143802 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time

5143804 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5143805 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5143806 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5143807 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5143808 the moment the government moves in this direction president musharraf would not delay for single second to quit the office
5143809 some dignitaries have arrived here to mediate a saudi royal air force plane is parked at chaklala air base so the matter could be a day or two
5143810 growing up in the commune wasnt exactly a barrel of laughs like emmanuel there was a leader whose sadistic tendencies flared often as a child separated from my parents at six months and raised in a mass nursery for the first three years of my life i was afraid a lot of the time the physical grounds in the novel are also similar to where i grew up and i did have a best friend who was the beginning inspiration for honey harper but everything else has either been made up or exaggerated in the hopes of creating a more believable riveting story

5143819 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5143820 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5143821 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5143822 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5143823 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5143824 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5143825 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5143826 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5143827 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5143828 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5143829 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5143830 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5143831 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5143832 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5143833 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5143834 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5143835 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5143836 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5143837 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5143838 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5143839 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5143840 i believe in the importance of the capitalist system but there is a such a focus on delivering those returns almost without any understanding that there are deeper issues that management is also about humanism and respect for people in the company serving the public interest higher obligations to yourself and the world
5143841 my strong advice would be to find a calm meditative state every day with the tempo of the executive life that seems almost impossible but its probably the most important thing that you can do
5143842 old mcdonald has a tractor and on my tractor i have a duck

5143844 jason made a lot of big plays yesterday and was all over the field
5143845 matt paced a great effort by the offensive line yesterday as well
5143846 it felt like one of the best days of my life
5143847 being away like that really makes you realize how lucky you are to be able to play football
5143848 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5143849 he should not be idolised in the previous 2 seasons he was one of the players with the lowest level of performance
5143850 silence of the lamps line cant remember who came up with that but well done shame that the saga itself is far from amusing
5143851 today ballack s got his first big title which is being a happy husband
5143852 and i do not like the fact that they tried to include him in the ronaldo deal money is not the problem for us now what matter 40 peterthegreat wrote 05 46bst jul 15 2008
5143853 robinho is just as good of a player as ronaldo if not better
5143854 if nothing happens hell stay at chelsea and extend his contract by two years
5143855 he doesnt see himself starting training in a few days with chelsea and then leaving to a new club
5143856 the reality of november is not that of today at the time didier was affected by departure of jose mourinho who he was very close to
5143857 today there is nothing to say that he wont stay at chelsea
5143858 however i could almost have guaranteed hed have been absolute rubbish if we signed him a 4 year deal for 130 000 a week and hed have just been the next sheva pizarro type useless waster at ac i wouldnt be at all surprised if hes firing all season now
5143859 xxxx is unhappy but we love xxxx xxxx and wed like him to stay at chelsea
5143860 were not interested in transferring him to a premier league club or another club in europe he has one year on his contract and we expect him to fulfil that
5143861 we are not negotiating a new deal for your player he can see out his current contract and maybe next season we can consider an extension if he performs this season
5143862 as a long term season ticket holder at stamford bridge i realise how difficult it is for football fans to apply the same logic to their own club as they do to their rivals
5143863 take away the blue tinted spectacles and see this for what it is
5143864 he has given much for chelsea but he has been fabulously rewarded others get paid more but others get paid less he has enough money to be secure for life and will continue to be fabulously rewarded so the question is this was all that badge kissing a sham
5143865 as for didier drogba chelsea will give you a huge contract in return you agree to a clause stipulating that if you return to your petulant ways as opposed to being the terror of every defender you can be summarily sold to the highest bidder
5143866 alexander hleb last night quit arsenal for barcelona in a 12million deal and was immediately tied into a 71m buy out clause
5143867 how good is life its my birthday today and my girlfriend has bought me a chelsea beach towel which will be well used in the upcoming aussie summer
5143868 real madrid boss bernd schuster wants to sign dutchman rafael van der vaart from hamburg
5143869 frank lampard will be allowed to leave chelsea if inter milan make a 20m bid for the england midfielder
5143870 its only logical that a club like barcelona want robinho he is also wanted by chelsea and manchester united
5143871 i knew i recognised that like a dog with a bone stubborn refusal to give up on an argument everyone else is bored with from somewhere
5143872 i wish i could marry drogba he is like a god to me
5143873 chelsea has made its position very clear to internazionale and they have come back now with a financial offer that will be rejected
5143874 the internazionale president massimo moratti claims that the chelsea midfielder frank lampard is torn between the italian club and staying at stamford bridge
5143875 lampard is a very serious lad and certainly he is torn between having the pleasure of doing something new or having a sense of duty towards his current club
5143876 in the end it is up to him to find a solution
5143877 for the acquisition of lampard we need to have patience we have the players approval
5143878 michael essiens first half goal brought chelsea a merited win to move them to within two points of manchester united albeit having played a game more and the resilience that thwarted a late revival from david
5143879 if this was a triumph for jonathan woodgate tottenham and juande ramos who has been at white hart lane less than four months it was a catastrophe for chelseas regime under avram grant
5143880 the road to the final against manchester united in moscow on may 21 was as long and hard as chelsea expected
5143881 if you look at amds business its been heavily consumer oriented
5143882 part of it has to do with their legacy as the scrappy start up theyve been focused more on the consumer market because the consumer market is relatively fast changing and much more flexible about what platforms they use its easier to get into but for amd to maximize its sales it needs to have a strong presence in the consumer and business sector
5143883 jayasuriya in form is always a great thing because he can contribute with both bat and ball
5143884 the start he gives makes a huge difference if he stays for 10 or 15 overs you are guaranteed a good start he is a bit like sehwag for india that gives a different dimension to our set up
5143885 whenever he sehwag gives us a good start we have a fair chance of winning the match
5143886 a good start is very important in any form of cricket but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers sehwag is a sort of player who takes a fair amount of risk he is a strokeplayer
5143887 he is in a very good nick and so is gautam gambhir they did well in the tests also and will have added responsibility but no pressure
5143888 jayasuriya can be compared with sehwag or retired australian adam gilchrist it is important not to let them have a good start
5143889 they are the batsmen who take chances they can commit mistakes if you try to restrict them all these players are very different but for someone like jayasuriya its important to get him out early
5143890 i am questioning whether or not the citizens of our world are well served by associations given the radical improvements in the way that people can find like minded folks and get stuff done here comes the bald faced blasphemy i believe that the trades causes and professions would in many cases be better off without their associations
5143891 let me add one other point that i think supports the association structure the concept of division of labor as my sons economics professor noted recently you can buy a pencil for a couple of cents today but an individual would be very hard pressed to make a pencil from scratch on his own the same applies to associations to quote wikipedia historically the growth of a more and more complex division of labor is closely associated with the growth of total output and trade the rise of capitalism and of the complexity of industrialization processes so basically those of us who have learned for example how to do effective membership marketing have a specialized skill that just anyone does not have taking advantage of those skills leads to a much more efficient and productive enterprise
5143892 now have nearly 226 000 members in 11 500 clubs in 92 countries

5143897 yes id like to take advantage of aopas automatic annual renewal program and save 4 off my dues this year i understand that each year you will automatically charge my annual membership dues to my credit card unless you receive a request from me to withdraw from this program enrollment in aopas aar program will convey 2 sweepstakes entries to the enrolling member
5143898 my association just began using automatic credit card renewal on our online renewals there was a large pick up of the service by our members the only con and you might not even term it that is coming up with a strategy on the process used to notify members of expired cards getting the updated credit card information naturally making sure the credit card information on file is encrypted in a really smart way
5143899 la guerra entre salman y shah rukh es sin duda como lo son los campamentos

5143902 on saturday hundreds of homeowners in distress crowded a hall at the national orange show events center to meet with representatives of their banks to hear experts explain what caused the mortgage meltdown and to learn how borrowers can dig their way out of default through strategies such as short sales or forbearance banks already have been saddled with a glut of homes borrowers have walked away from the days speakers emphasized
5143903 they said that homeowners in trouble should overcome shame and denial because the problem only will get worse the longer they wait
5143904 moreno valley resident catherine cee said shes upside down on her mortgage she paid 178 000 for her six bedroom 3 bathroom 2 630 square foot house in 2001 long before the real estate market went crazy in the inland empire and she got a fixed interest loan
5143905 but when she refinanced a few years later to fund some renovations she unwittingly signed an adjustable rate loan
5143906 now cee said she owes 345 000 on her house and her loan has been sold several times to different mortgage companies making it hard to direct her inquiries to the person able to devise a solution other than default
5143907 i did not want my loan to default cee said during a question and answer session with panelists
5143908 veronica turner of san bernardino is tired of unreturned phone calls from her lender and choosing between buying food for her son and paying the mortgage on her house
5143909 andrew eakins and his wife of apple valley are six months into foreclosure on their house and are looking for help on how to save their home
5143910 and while many of those in attendance were happy to be given a chance to get questions asked and obtain the information they needed some wondered why it was happening now
5143911 twelve small units in brookhaven condominiums a development of two converted apartment buildings have sold since december for 360 000 or more roughly double the prices of similar condos in the neighborhood indeed the dozen brookhaven units had surged by 31 percent in value since 2006 even as the median price of condos in the area plummeted 54 percent
5143912 neither brookhavens developers nor their bankers would explain this remarkable performance despite repeated requests from the north county times two of brookhavens buyers say they face foreclosure and tarnished credit records
5143913 after eight months of no sales activity at the complex which is near the corner of 15th avenue and escondido boulevard a 1 128 square foot condo sold for 385 000 however according to the county assessors office the sale never happened
5143914 the buyer of record julie cottam of escondido said she never provided any money for the condo and did not know she briefly owned a unit in the brookhaven complex she said she signed some documents as a favor to a friend nancy renfeldt
5143915 i dont know if it was a deed i just trusted her i was a friend cottam said adding she never planned to buy the condo
5143916 soon after cottams transaction appeared on the database business improved for the developers a month later in december 2007 a 948 square foot condo sold for 360 000 the price was up dramatically from the 256 000 paid for an identical unit purchased the previous march the most recent sale
5143917 the buyer who broke brookhavens long sales drought was maria roberts of tijuana roberts husband james said the couple had no knowledge of the escondido real estate market they said several condos had sold for that price so it had to be a good price he said
5143918 james roberts said the sales pitch on the investment worked like this the couple would hold the property in his wifes name for a year while the developers paid the mortgage by finding renters after a year the developers would buy back the property and cover any depreciation
5143919 for their trouble the robertses would receive 50 000 he said they have received only 20 000 he said

5144032 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5144033 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5144034 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5144035 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues

5144037 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5144038 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5144067 the government has accepted its critical leadership role in initiatives to halt and reverse crime trends in the bahamas
5144068 changed as we became more tolerant of breaches of law habitually disobeyed the law including traffic and environmental laws and moved away from the traditions and values on which our country was built
5144069 the urgent solutions we now need to address our crime and criminality problems are today driving us in many directions crime prevention and criminal justice effective law enforcement prison reform social development including support for our families and our young people and regional and international cooperation
5144070 to keep them on the cutting edge of effective law enforcement
5144071 is now well established in our communities systematically cultivating successful and effective police community partnerships and making a difference in the quality of life of our people
5144072 it is fully appreciated that incarceration is a public safety measure and that the safe custody of inmates is a priority for the prison
5144073 the government is however strongly committed to policies and programmes aimed at ensuring that inmates who are released from prison have the requisite skills and training to get a job and to stay out of prison
5144074 in short we favour rehabilitation and correction the government is also exploring alternatives to incarceration in clearly defined circumstances
5144075 the royal bahamas police force has an impressive apprehension and arrest rate the level of trust between police and community is growing the force is receiving more intelligence on illegal firearms and consequently more of these weapons are being recovered

5144088 i just tried to stay relaxed i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line

5144090 cable amp wireless has been a staple in the caribbean for more than 100 years and the company intends to be around long into the future to bring our customers the superior brand of telecommunications products and services that has helped to put the caribbean ahead of many countries in telecommunications infrastructure
5144091 it also gives us a sense of pride that we have contributed to building superior resilient networks that keep the people of this region in touch with the world
5144092 our sense of pride also extends to the areas which we have supported throughout the region as part of our social responsibility including education and culture sport and community activities
5144093 our customers colleagues and other stakeholders have told us that we need to do many things differently to deliver a vastly superior service
5144094 we have listened and many changes can be expected as we continue to develop new services and as we continue our work in the communities of the caribbean and on the training and development of our employees
5144095 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5144096 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5144097 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5144098 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5144099 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5144100 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5144102 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5144103 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5144104 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5144105 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5144106 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5144107 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5144108 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5144109 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5144110 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5144111 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5144112 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5144113 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5144114 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5144115 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5144116 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5144120 with the economic downturn spreading to the eurozone and certain emerging markets investors are starting to view u s assets as attractive
5144121 the net balance of asset allocators overweight u s equities stands at 12 percent its highest level in more than six years
5144122 supporting this view is the widely held belief that the u s dollar is undervalued
5144123 a record net 58 percent say this month that the dollar is undervalued while a net 71 percent say the euro is overvalued investors believe that the u s has a better corporate profit outlook and higher quality earnings than the eurozone
5144124 european investors have responded to the fall in the oil price by selling oil producers and buying into discretionary consumer stocks
5144125 the percentage of european investors overweight oil amp gas stocks collapsed to 11 percent in august from 52 percent in july
5144126 investors have also significantly scaled back large underweight positions in travel amp leisure personal amp household goods and retail companies
5144127 technology and media sectors both with significant exposure to consumer demand also swung back in favour
5144128 at the same time inflation fears among the european panel have fallen to levels even lower than in the global survey
5144129 a net 45 percent of european fund managers expect the regions core inflation to fall over the next 12 months in june 32 percent of the european panel were predicting rising inflation
5144130 the market appears to have overreacted to a fall in the oil price and investors have turned a blind eye to second round effects of inflation such as rising wages
5144131 it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
5144132 one consequence of the recent fall in the oil price has been a rapid unwinding of what the survey has highlighted as a highly crowded trade investors have reduced long or overweight positions in energy and started closing underweight positions in financials
5144133 but have they lost sight of the fundamentals in unwinding this position
5144134 while we have started to see some demand for oil curtailed in oecd economies the economic fundamentals in china and other emerging markets support oil at more than us 100 a barrel into 2009
5144135 investors have moved to close underweight positions in european financials after second quarter results suggested banks are on the road to improvement
5144136 banks are highly unlikely to see a v shaped recovery in their share price given the uncertainties in the market
5144137 apart from the economic outlook a key question is how stringent regulators will be in setting new rules to govern banks capital ratios no one yet knows what the appropriate capital structure of the future is
5144138 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that

5144143 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5144144 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5144145 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
5144146 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
5144147 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
5144148 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
5144149 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
5144150 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
5144151 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
5144152 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
5144153 all of the companys actions were approved by the defense ministry including the materials transferred to the training companies the information security standards were set emphasized and maintained by experienced security officers and we have no knowledge of these claims
5144154 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
5144155 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed
5144156 what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
5144157 i tell the zionists we dont fear you say whatever you want and do whatever you want we know that you are planning new assassinations of resistance leaders but this will not make us retreat
5144158 there has been an israeli uproar about the reinforcement of hizbullahs strength there has been talk of sophisticated arms and an air defense system and threats if hizbullah uses this kind of system
5144159 no one can expect me to stand up and say whether we possess new weapons or we dont
5144160 keeping weapons secret is part of hizbullahs strength this is part of directing the battle of liberation and resistance against this enemy
5144161 the results of the second lebanon war are evident even today in both the military and political fields in israel
5144162 ehud barak admits that the reason for losing the war was a lack of military experience so who is there left in israel with military experience if not all those failed generals those who stand against us today are the same failures who have already suffered blows from us before
5144163 died two years ago in lebanon and will be brought to political burial in two months
5144164 is it barak or ashkenazi who failed against the resistance as head of the northern command
5144165 this september we will see the end of israeli prime minister olmerts rule i remember baraks speeches back when he was the enemys prime minister in 2000 need i remind him that he set the date of the withdrawal from lebanon in july and we forced him to pull out in may
5144166 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
5144167 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
5144168 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
5144169 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
5144170 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
5144171 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
5144172 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
5144173 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
5144174 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
5144175 we are now in a fight against the great russia
5144176 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
5144177 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
5144178 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
5144179 they can walk away or they can sell assets there will not be another big refinancing they are pretty much at the end of the line

5144183 some parts of the country arent interested in teaching climate change
5144184 we should be teaching the fundamentals of climate not necessarily this topic

5144186 if anyone wants to win an oscar they can just work hamptons heavies love woody
5144187 i dont think theres any doubt that the nature of the offence is a serious one the parties who have spoken today everyones alluded to the public corruption how it affects the community and the blight it causes
5144188 tomorrow we will go ahead with the nationalization and recover the cement industries to launch the housing plan and continue developing the country

5144191 the judge had no alternative under existing law because he must follow the decision of pratt and morgan the privy council and the local court of appeal
5144192 neither of the grounds put forward by the district court grounds which have been loosely characterized as government deception and outrageous conduct supports the drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment

5144195 it limits your capacity to act if you go from buying oil at 60 per barrel on average to buying it at 110 per barrel

5144204 weve got to drill here and weve got to become independent of foreign oil
5144205 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or spouses or their doctors and their family members
5144206 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year prolife record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a prolife president and this presidency will have prolife policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you

5144210 i dont want to make money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth but i can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day seven days a week that some people would classify as rich who some want to raise their taxes and their payroll taxes
5144211 by the way if you havent noticed we now have a pro america president of france which proves if you live long enough anything can happen in america
5144212 when i started saying you know were going to eliminate meals and gifts from corporate lobbyists i remember one of my colleagues whose name will be unmentioned who said well where do you expect us to eat mcdonalds and i thought well actually a lot of our constituents probably do eat at mcdonalds so that wouldnt be such a bad thing
5144213 we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue but the point is it was 3 million of your money
5144214 its not acceptable that the government is not disclosing the correspondence with the german government

5144217 strength and quality of nursing leading to low turnover rates and a high level of job satisfaction
5144218 we live in an attractive city but we have also worked collectively to do some things to address the shortage
5144219 ive been in nursing 30 some years and you never take your eye off this
5144220 austin is pretty mobile more mobile than you think our magnet designation and our national reputation helps us draw nurses but were growing i see houses going up and people buying them its an issue were going to have
5144221 we very much wanted wayne to be the face of the brand
5144222 mercedes will set wayne up as an icon with their cars there is an option in the contract for him to feature in some adverts
5144223 one night i was doing this classical thing i do using the volume control and i was playing it on a strat
5144224 when i finished the show someone came up to me and told that i sounded like stevie ray vaughan playing a violin well bless his heart and god bless stevie ray but it sounded nothing like stevie ray and please dont get me wrong i was heavily influenced by stevie but what it showed me is that if you waltz up there with a stratocaster and play anything remotely resembling the blues youre going to be compared to someone else
5144225 while it is possible that the deal may finally go through the george soros team is yet to take the final call

5144233 great marketing is great storytelling people are inherently interested in stories whether in films or novels or even brands the problem is that the stories often go untold
5144234 i cant think of a better way to thank all those who labored in the name of goodwill than to make this gesture
5144235 it was an honor and a pleasure to donate my time to the remarkable we are the world xxx project that at least has been gloriously displayed in a two page spread in the current issue of avn and i am extremely grateful to amber for giving me the opportunity to participate
5144236 i drove the ball very well all week which was the key
5144237 this course makes you hit it in certain areas on the greens areas that are much easier to get to from the fairways
5144238 my hat goes off to the superintendent and his crew for a great golf course given all the rain early in the week the third win feels every bit as good as the first two

5144245 the only statement i care to make about the protocols is that they fit in with what is going on they are sixteen years old and they have fitted the world situation up to this time they fit it now
5144246 at around 12 in the night the flood came all our children are hungry our beds clothes and utensils got submerged in water
5144247 we were on the same motorcycle all of a sudden due to the sudden force of water our motorcycle got stuck my aunts son got drowned i came out the fire brigade people did nothing the rope of the fire brigade broke
5144248 if i could preach only one sermon it would be a sermon against fear
5144249 fear not for i am with you be not dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you yes i will help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand
5144250 are you aware that the most repeated command from the lips of jesus was fear not are you aware that the command from heaven not to be afraid appears in every book of the bible
5144251 exiled from the position which he held as the greatest preacher of his age this noble man refused to be intimidated what can i fear he asks will it be death but you know that christ is my life and that i shall gain by death will it be exile but the earth and all its fullness are the lords will it be loss of wealth but we brought nothing into this world and can carry nothing out thus all the terrors of the world are contemptible in my eyes and i smile at all its good things poverty i do not fear riches i do not sigh for and from death i do not shrink
5144252 do not be afraid i am the first and the last
5144253 i was here before there was anything to fear and i will be here after all things you fear have passed away
5144254 it would be great to get 10 the more the better
5144255 but theyre not the only challenge iran is going to be in the mix turkey is going to be in the mix all those former soviet union countries theyre also going to be trying to win gold medals so were going to have to be ready for everybody
5144256 i really think theyre on a different level right now
5144257 their conditioning and their strength programs are very good in their technique some of the things are subtle things that i can pick up because ive wrestled for so long
5144258 the fact that they wrestle freestyle their whole life gives them an edge an upper hand in that category
5144259 we couldnt keep asking 4a schools in chattanooga teams to travel to knoxville to be able to play 4a schools
5144260 tennessee is like three different states because of its geography there was too much travel
5144261 i have had no resistance in my part of the state because our schools were so tired of driving to knoxville to play ball
5144262 it is going to save money big time plus the crowds are going to be bigger this is also going to put the old rivalries back that you had way back yonder local schools are going to play each other
5144263 the 4a football coaches if they play 5a schools in the regular season want to know what its going to take to get into the playoffs
5144264 when you add the two closest 5a schools into our 4a district which is now going to be eight schools most people figure those two 5a schools will get the two automatic berths how do the 4a schools qualify for the playoffs there are still some things that need to be worked through
5144265 even if gas gets back down to 2 a gallon i would still be for this system
5144266 the more classifications you have the more travel you have
5144267 we wanted to go back to one classification for 32 schools a 6a conference
5144268 in the end it was about winning and losing and some feeling they were not going to be on a level playing field we need to get ourselves out of the position of what is good for each school and get to what is best statewide
5144269 you dont want to be chomping on an apple or anything
5144270 remarkable capacity for self delusion and avoidance which may have explained his conduct
5144271 i bet he hasnt got a smile on his face like that any more
5144272 its almost like weve got two things to worry about the media trial and the police they actually impact on each other hugely which is scary and its not fair on tony
5144273 they clearly drew a bright line separating themselves on some issues
5144274 but what was distinct here was they did it without smashing each other
5144275 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that but there are ways that we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
5144276 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5144277 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5144278 you do everything you can to get that decision right
5144279 all those questions surrounding the war have been very difficult for me
5144280 the warrens give away 90 percent of their income through three charities acts of mercy which serves people with aids equipping leaders which trains leaders in developing countries and the global p e a c e fund which fights poverty disease corruption and illiteracy using local congregations
5144281 americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5144282 i think that americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
5144283 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5144284 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5144285 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family youre middle class i would argue if youre making more than 250 000 then youre in the top 3 or 4 percent in this country youre doing well under the approach im taking if youre making 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut
5144286 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth i dont want to raise anybodys taxes
5144287 a lot of teams have looked at cleveland and looked the other way were usually the team that other teams have their highlights on but no more
5144288 ive seen a highlight reel of braylon edwards catching the ball and me running for touchdowns were not the team to look over anymore cleveland is in the house put us on prime time and lets see what we can do
5144289 we havent been on monday night for the five years since ive been here its a big stage for us to play on and its good to see where we are against the world champions especially the starters and first teamers
5144290 they have a really good offense with eli a big back in brandon jacobs 6 4 264 and good receivers
5144291 youre supposed to use preseason games to knock the cobwebs out last game we could have done better with our angles to the ball we cant be looking in the backfield while guys are running past us
5144292 the younger guys will have to step up and show what they can do
5144293 its a great opportunity for them and theyve been working really hard
5144294 getting more quality work is what i want to build on
5144295 you can never value enough game experience its big especially for someone in my position
5144296 you could see on braylons td catch vs the jets and some of the plays donte had theyre fun to throw to they make it easy on quarterbacks
5144297 with a guy like edwards youve got a wide margin of error where you can put the ball hopefully ill have the opportunity to work with them maybe next game or sometime soon
5144298 this will give the guys a chance to get their minds right while theyre in the hotel and focus on the game
5144299 itll help with the distractions that come with a monday night game as far as pregame and tickets and interviews and stuff like that even though all that stuff is part of the game you have to stay focused
5144300 is that like a trick question or a prediction or something
5144301 i hope at the end of the season that i feel like i made the right decision i hope jets fans and people throughout the nfl feel i made the right decision id love to win the super bowl but im not going to make any guarantees all i can say is ill do my best and hopefully thats enough
5144302 id be foolish to think that on opening day i would know this offense like ive known the offense that ive been in the past the bottom line is its still football
5144303 im not talking about the physical side because brett can still throw the football with anyone out there im talking about the mental aspect learning the offense its not that easy
5144304 im very open to new ideas new thinking free spirits that type of thing
5144305 there are some things that as a coach you dont want to coach him out of a good play you dont want to out coach a guys instincts when its working you dont want to mess that up
5144306 you can have the best players possible but it doesnt guarantee you wins i want these guys to know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not going to call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to do what i have to do pat guys on the back hug them pick them up off the ground and hope they do the same for me and hope thats enough to win
5144307 when you meet him you can tell hes a superstar but he doesnt tell you that hes got the aura and charisma but hes down to earth
5144308 but they were in green bay as well there werent nearly as many people but those people in wisconsin theyd come to expect winning

5144311 it was christmas day we were allowed to stand outside of our cell for a few minutes and those days we were not allowed to see or communicate with each other although we certainly did and i was standing outside for my few minutes outside my cell he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his handle on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there as just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
5144312 people think you are sometimes manic depressive i think im going to have to ask you to leave the company

5144314 i dont know that dell can make a compelling case
5144315 why cant i get action when i have a premium hand
5144316 the paradox of our time is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers wider freeways but narrower minds we
5144317 we drink too much smoke too much spend too recklessly
5144318 we have multiplied our possessions but reduced our values talk too much love too seldom and hate too often
5144319 weve learned how to make a living but not a life weve added years to life but not life to years weve been to the moon and back but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor weve conquered outer space but not inner space
5144320 these are the times of fast foods and slow indigestion big men and small character steep profits and shallow relationships these are the days of two incomes and more divorce
5144321 remember spend time with your loved ones because they are not going to be around forever say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe because that little person will soon grow up and leave your side

5144328 i along with two of my friends had boarded the vehicle at munsong golai as we approached the highway i heard someone shout brake fail and in no time our vehicle was flying down into the river
5144329 i somehow swam to a rock in the river thereafter i dont remember anything when i regained my senses i found myself surrounded by local people at the same spot
5144330 the actual driver of the vehicle was hari pradhan but at the time of the accident perhaps his friend sanjay rajbongshi was on the wheel the fifth occupant of the vehicle was sanjay bishwakarma a resident of rangpo
5144331 as well as being well equipped and experienced in alpine conditions anyone going into back country areas of tongariro national park including the tongariro alpine crossing should be aware that there are avalanche hazards

5144336 if youre a comcast customer and you buy a package of content from us you should be able to consume and manage that content across screens
5144337 we very much believe that the internet and the pc should be a tool to manage and consume that content
5144338 one of the luxuries we have as part of comcast is the scale to pursue our huge ambitions for cim
5144339 we want to capture a share of what everybody believes will be an increasingly ad supported revenue stream online

5144341 not only is it the right strategy its the essential strategy
5144342 consumers are showing companies what needs to be done by shifting their consumption away from linear video any company that doesnt give customers what theyre looking for is going to be disadvantaged
5144343 are worried that if they give you online video youll drop your premium cable subscription
5144344 theyre right in that fear by the way but only comcast seems to have the money and the commitment to getting there first rather than watching someone else come in and walk away with their business

5144348 we think consumers really are going to respond to what we can offer
5144349 we have 30 year relationships with these content guys its a synergistic relationship with them theres no reason why that relationship shouldnt extend online
5144350 fancast reinforces linear by helping people find new and complementary content
5144351 i think its nothing but good news for us to figure out ways of working with comcast and other distributors to extend to as many platforms and as many devices as possible
5144352 they can experiment and they can come in later and buy and integrate if they need to take advantage of a market trend

5144369 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter

5144371 theres a lot of things we can do in the near term and a lot of things we can do in the further term theres a lot more to go in terms of efficiency improvements

5144475 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
5144476 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
5144477 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
5144478 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
5144479 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
5144480 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
5144481 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
5144482 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
5144483 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
5144484 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution

5144489 when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been received with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for me that followed and else when i caroused or when my plans were accomplished still i was not happy but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health refreshed signing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn when i saw in the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light when i wandered over the beach and undressing bathed laughing with cool waters and saw the sun rise and when i thought how my dear lover was on her way coming oh then i was happy oh then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourished me more and the beautiful day passed well
5144490 and the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came my friend and at the night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores

5144529 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5144530 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5144531 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5144532 semel met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5144533 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5144534 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5144535 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5144536 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5144537 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5144538 during her stay in promises lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too

5144548 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
5144549 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
5144550 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
5144551 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
5144552 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
5144553 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field

5144560 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
5144561 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished

5144579 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
5144580 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5144581 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
5144582 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
5144583 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
5144584 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
5144585 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
5144586 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
5144587 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
5144588 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
5144589 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
5144590 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
5144591 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
5144592 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
5144593 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
5144594 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
5144595 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
5144596 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
5144597 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
5144598 there will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so to speak producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods and this seems to be the final revolution
5144599 oh my god like im doing a start up no one else i know is doing a start up so i am taking a lot of risk
5144600 it is our intention to go to the economic union by 2011 with the oecs countries and political union by 2013 the modalities of that have not been worked out
5144601 the audience only responds to the truth and they recognize it immediately
5144602 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5144603 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5144604 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5144605 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5144606 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5144607 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5144608 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5144609 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5144610 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians

5144716 in the summer we witnessed an increasing number of incidents explosions shooting
5144717 we met the general of the russian peacekeepers and he said that the separatists were not answering the phone
5144718 where were the russian peacekeepers when the south ossetians were shelling the georgian positions
5144719 at 6 i gave the order to prepare everything to go out from the bases
5144720 on thursday thursday afternoon they noticed equipment and troops on the road rolling to karaleti
5144721 from 18 00 georgian troops from inner districts are relocated to the area
5144722 we are ready for any sort of agreement in the interest of peace
5144723 bryza said he was not told that georgian armor was already moving toward the south ossetian line and continued to do so even after saakashvili declared a cease fire
5144724 we started to check and around 11 50 i got confirmation that russian armor was coming in
5144725 to do otherwise he said would have been to cede georgian sovereignty he had no choice he said
5144726 during these intense exchanges between the leadership here and me when they said they were going to lift the cease fire we said dont put your forces in harms way because you cannot prevail
5144727 and the response was we understand that we are going to shell the road on which the russians are approaching and try to keep them back thats what they said
5144728 its not like a very open and big city and i can tell you that we only targeted the places the governmental organizations
5144729 but when we entered we got a very heavy attack what the officers are telling me is that it was something like hell
5144730 i think they had something around 15 to 20 000 in the theater
5144731 i had only 9 000 they were already bringing in new soldiers they had a chance to rest and our soldiers were becoming tired and more tired because i had no additional forces to change them after two days of battle they were too tired

5144778 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5144779 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5144780 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5144781 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5144782 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5144783 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community

5144785 ben tzen sie keine fl ssigen brandbeschleuniger wie spiritus oder benzin dies kann sich mit der luft vermischen und explodieren und das in der regel mit sehr hohen temperaturen stellen sie den grill auch generell im windschatten auf so vermeiden sie dass durch windb en eine stichflamme entsteht
5144786 l schen sie die brennende person sofort verschwenden sie keine zeit notfalls werfen sie die betroffene person auf den boden w lzen sie hin und her jede sekunde z hlt und erst im zweiten schritt sollten sie den rettungsdienst alarmieren und entfernen sie im anschluss daran verbrannte kleidung von der haut k hlen sie mit wasser aber benutzen sie keine salben oder puder zumindest in dieser phase noch nicht

5144788 it says much about shevchenkos fall that even with didier drogba likely to miss the start of the season as he continues rehabilitation on a knee injury he cannot force his way into the reckoning with milan unwilling to offer him salvation at the san siro his only options appear to be sitting it out at stamford bridge or taking a huge pay cut to move to major league soccer which he is likely to do when his contract expires in three years time
5144789 if this was a triumph for jonathan woodgate tottenham and juande ramos who has been at white hart lane less than four months it was a catastrophe for chelseas regime under avram grant
5144790 i think i settled down a lot more as the game went on
5144791 dont give up fuck everyone who keeps you down create or die once you stop creating you are dead
5144792 we are here for a good time we are here to bring back sex drugs violence and the devil to rock n roll we are here to save music from the vomit that the record labels are spewing forth
5144793 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5144794 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5144795 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5144796 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

5144798 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5144799 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5144800 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5144801 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5144802 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5144803 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5144804 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5144805 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5144806 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5144807 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5144808 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5144809 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5144810 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5144811 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5144812 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5144813 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5144814 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5144815 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5144816 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5144817 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5144818 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5144819 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5144820 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5144821 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5144822 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5144823 this is a planning took where all things are going
5144824 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5144825 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5144826 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5144827 do you think it would be weird if i went out with your cousin i really like him could you talk to him for me
5144828 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5144829 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5144830 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5144831 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5144832 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5144833 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5144834 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5144835 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5144836 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5144837 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5144838 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5144839 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5144840 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5144841 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5144842 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5144843 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5144844 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5144845 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5144846 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5144847 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5144848 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5144849 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5144850 the amount of offensive philosophy and concepts and plays we have in is amazing considering how young we are
5144851 we have a lot of fight and a lot of guys with ability they dont have a lot of experience so we have to keep playing at the level we played at today what i mean by that is playing extremely hard
5144852 we wanted to see if they could handle them one on one

5144860 methadone once used mainly in addiction treatment centers to replace heroin is today being given out by family doctors osteopaths and nurse practitioners for throbbing backs joint injuries and a host of other severe pains but it is implicated in more than twice as many deaths as heroin and is rivaling or surpassing the tolls of painkillers like oxycontin and vicodin federal regulators acknowledge that they were slow to recognize the dangers of newly widespread methadone prescribing and to confront physician ignorance about the drug

5144871 they have now gone into the realm of video game times
5144872 so and so cant remember who they said it was 6 15am after all will be saying where he thinks ronaldo will be playing in the new season
5144873 take martin oneill for example i heard some villa fans maintaining that his early rants against liverpool in the gareth barry saga were in fact some kind of clever ploy on his part or that he was in fact nobly making a stand not just for villa but for all of football and there are various other theories put forward
5144874 this was not the most impressive display from chelsea it was a hard fought win on a bitterly cold afternoon in the north east but you cannot play derby every week and you get
5144875 chelsea got what they deserved after a dreadful first half and a lack of ruthlessness in failing to close down the game after michael essien had given them the lead in the 56th minute and
5144876 chelsea yet again paced themselves beautifully to stay in step with manchester united
5144877 the roars of the anfield crowd at the close were solely of defiance

5144892 mr lucifier why do you like the sunday the best
5144893 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5144894 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5144895 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5144896 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5144897 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5144898 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5144899 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5144900 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5144901 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5144902 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5144903 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5144904 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5144905 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5144906 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5144907 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5144908 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5144909 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5144910 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5144911 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5144912 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5144913 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5144914 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5144915 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5144916 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5144917 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5144918 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5144919 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5144920 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5144921 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5144922 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5144923 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5144924 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5144925 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5144926 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5144927 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5144928 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5144929 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5144930 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5144931 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5144932 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5144933 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires

5144941 it is very rare that we are able to see the world upside down and regularly viewing the world from this angle can bring a variety of amazing benefits to our life turning ourselves upside down is not only an amazing practice for health but for beauty as well a headstand can reduce facial wrinkles and if practiced regularly is a natural face lift a headstand can actually convert gray hair back to its natural color it will certainly delay the onset of gray hair this is due to the increase in blood supply and nutrients to the hair follicles in the scalp balding can also be prevented or slowed and thicker healthier hair is produced
5144942 all the struggles before and everything i went through to get back healthy it really makes this championship special to me this is one of the best tracks weve ridden all year
5144943 two months ago i was just settling for second i had to believe in myself to get where i am now and compared to last year when i didnt win at all im thankful to be healthy and having success
5144944 in reba meagher i thought i had found the perfect woman a compassionate and intelligent lady of timeless beauty she has been 39 for three years now who can sniff out a free drink like a truffle she is also a masterful politician for example by living in coogee instead of her electorate of cabramatta she has achieved the perfect balance between representing the interests of working people and no having to touch them
5144945 before i go on i want to make it perfectly reasonable and legitimate for any democratically elected government to tell the media that unless they write only positive stories they will be cut off from all contact and no longer recognized it has worked well in china for decades

5144954 yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public
5144955 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5144956 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5144957 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5144958 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5144959 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno pemberton said
5144960 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys j
5144961 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5144962 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were gibbs said
5144963 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5144964 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome gibbs noted
5144965 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5144966 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet pemberton said
5144967 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible gibbs said
5144968 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5144969 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization the former washington redskins coach said
5144970 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5144971 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous white said
5144972 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5144973 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota suhy said
5144974 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5144975 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5144976 extremely detrimental to the sport and was confident nascar will address it
5144977 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5144978 when i had a conversation with him theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays
5144979 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5144980 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5144981 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5144982 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5144983 the enabling legislation requires that you create an area that is capable of handling the development rights that might be put into it
5144984 north pointe right now is dealing with sewer issues that as i understand it will end up costing 30 to 40 million
5144985 its an opportunity to preserve the rural character of the county
5144986 it would have the potential of preserving a land base which we need for various environmental reasons
5144987 its the best idea that ive seen on the table for a win win solution between the no growthers and the rural property landowners
5144988 there is a potential to create building lots that the market demands that are not currently available and as a result of those lots not being available people are building in the rural areas
5144989 you might create some marketable rights for people who dont want to divide their property
5144990 we always thought of this tdr approach as a way of protecting the rural area by encouraging growth in the growth area but with 3 plus gas there might be a new paradigm operating here it may be a transportation planning tool in that with gas prices that high more and more people are going to want to live centrally where they work so this tdr project might facilitate people living where they can afford to live
5144991 if we take seriously both the statements of the city and the county that we want to work towards a sustainable community i think this is a creative and potentially useful tool
5144992 i dont think that the 50 acre mandatory down zoning from 21 acre minimum lot sizes creates a fair market value for the development rights to me it creates a fire sale of development rights all of a sudden theyre there just like a hailstorm and when you got a flood on the market prices tend to go down
5144993 you are violating landowners property rights and assuming that their land is your land to talk about and to do with what you will the starting point of saying that there is going to be a mandatory 50 acre downzoning is a violation right there of what landowners and property owners would want to see happen
5144994 the plan as it was presented is fundamentally flawed because it rests on coercion it rests on a force that to me is not sustainable ultimately and it deprives people of fundamental rights and the vision it creates is one i cant even begin to think that anybody could take seriously
5144995 im extraordinarily skeptical that youd need to give up two division rights to get one home built i struggle to believe a 50 acre downzoned parcel could have a value that is comparable to todays 50 acre parcel with division rights
5144996 davids density is much much too low in order to create those lots theyve got to be bigger you cant expect people that want a yard and a big house that are going to build on a 5 to 10 acre lot in the rural areas which they currently can to come into a quarter acre of half acre lot in the boundary
5144997 its way too complex to work in a natural marketplace i dont see enough positive market incentives to create a legitimate market place that will actually work i see it as kind of one sided right now
5144998 i would like not to expand the existing growth areas and wish there were some way to utilize existing growth areas as the receiving area
5144999 if no solution is reached the winnowing away of property rights thats happening dramatically over the last 18 months and will continue theres a high degree of probability that 5 or 10 years from now rural property owners will have far less ability to do with their property what they can do today
5145000 there seem to be two core goals of the countys growth management strategy number one to discourage growth in the rural areas number two to create vibrant compact mixed use areas in our development areas where youre going to attract growth that would otherwise go into other areas the pro i would offer is that this is a creative proposal for trying to find a politically palatable way to accomplish that first goal discouraging growth in the rural areas by simply downzoning rural area properties broadly the con that i have with it is that in trying to achieve that first goal we seem to be undermining the second goal of creating vibrant and attractive development areas
5145001 the pro is that if we achieve a workable plan that all interested parties including the landowners can agree on that adds a lot of valuable predictability for the future my counter acting con is that ive spent most of my adult life in government aggressive governments continue to be aggressive and we could perhaps reach a conclusion here that makes permanent changes on the land itself but doesnt prevent future actions by the county government to make future controls added on to this agreement
5145002 its complexity is going to be its constant bane and theres no question about that i still think that its fundamental pro is that the proposal tries to balance the legitimate concerns of property owners against the need to constrain development in the rural area
5145003 im looking for government that is incentivizing and asking for permission to do certain things with your land and to understand the investment thats in that land
5145004 farmers put their investment in the land and now its being played with like a board game
5145005 the ones that were voluntary did not have a single transaction
5145006 at the current rate of rural development between roughly 200 and 300 lots a year that number of vacant lots could basically satisfy 20 to 30 years of rural development how do rural landowners react to a downzoning when the market for development rights created by the downzoning may not kick in for decades
5145007 i think there is enough significant anecdotal evidence that the unavailability of lots that the market wants in albemarle county over the past 10 to 15 years has pushed people into the rural areas more importantly its also pushed people into neighboring counties thats bled our tax base its also created tremendous transportation issues weve got all these people that weve pushed out of the community paying taxes elsewhere yet theyre using our roads and we have no tax base and no money to help fix those roads
5145008 i wonder if were fighting the last war here if the building community nationwide sees a trend that says people are looking for smaller lots smaller houses and as tony said gas prices are going up and theyre going to stay up several people have mentioned that the trend in albemarle county is less building in the rural areas more building in the growth areas i wonder if the markets arent going to be taking care of a lot of these problems on their own and the government doesnt any longer need to step in and be as forceful as this kind of plan talks about
5145009 if were able to come up with something its going to take a while and a lot of mental changes and a lot of compromises on different peoples parts
5145010 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5145011 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5145012 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5145013 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5145014 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5145015 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5145016 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5145017 when i had a conversation with him theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays
5145018 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5145019 ill invite you to reevaluate your stance on this and hopefully this is all just internet talk
5145020 it is as if daves is closing because it is no longer needed to soothe those aches and pains of my life
5145021 there were no problems in any public areas the family left very hurriedly and without saying much to each other but the news about this so called assault was a shock nobody here had a clue
5145022 ive had a really good european season so i know im in good shape its really good to come out here and thats a pb for me so im happy
5145023 its just good being here in this atmosphere its amazing out here so im having a great time
5145024 i try and be a good sports man when i come out to these big meets i make sure that everyone knows im here as well
5145025 well our trainings geared around running in championships so the whole emphasis of this year was to be able to go out run the heats the semis and the finals and to be able to keep backing up during my preparations in europe i kept grouping grand prix races together to kind of simulate running whilst being tired as well i think thats the trick for me
5145026 yeah its awesome for australia weve got quite a big depth of 400m boys its gonna be awesome for the 4 x 400m relay as well which is coming later on so im happy for joel
5145027 jd shall we offer blue bayou hell of a nick btw the chance of proving himself by writing the preview column
5145028 look son you cant touch type with your right which would be ok if your left was any good but it isnt and weve been waiting for you to bulk up a bit but you cant seem to get past a couple of paragraphs your use of the adverbial phrase beggars belief and you struggle with form and authorial voice were a team that thrives on effective syntax we cant see you coping against outfits like the russian formalists or the post structuralists theyd take you apart son
5145029 ac milan coach carlo ancelotti has confirmed chelsea striker andriy shevchenko will not return to the san siro this summer
5145030 the roars of the anfield crowd at the close were solely of defiance
5145031 if this was a triumph for jonathan woodgate tottenham and juande ramos who has been at white hart lane less than four months it was a catastrophe for chelseas regime under avram grant

5145046 whoever shares with others should do it generously whoever shows kindness to others should do it cheerfully
5145047 being kind is a human attribute when we say she is a kind person or he surely was kind to me we express a very warm feeling in our competitive and often violent world kindness is not the most frequent response but when we encounter it we know that we are blessed is it possible to grow in kindness to become a kind person yes but it requires discipline to be kind means to treat another person as your kin your intimate relative we say we are kin or he is next to kin to be kind is to reach out to someone as being of kindred spirit here is the great challenge all people whatever their color religion or sex belong to humankind and are called to be kind to one another treating one another as brothers and sisters there is hardly a day in our lives in which we are not called to this
5145048 when we are insulted we answer back with kind words
5145049 later in the day a woman came by middle aged hair streaked with grey and pulled back dress was simple reminded me of a middle school librarian face was wrinkled and earnest said shed been sick for a dozen years hiv positive thats a long time i said long enough she agreed to run out of doctors money even hope but worst of all she had run out of friends they were afraid of me she said worried about catching the disease my church hadnt turned me out but they hadnt helped me out either i hadnt been home in years been living in a shelter but then jesus came to town he was on his way to treat the mayors daughter who was dying the crowd was thick and people were pushing but i was desperate she spoke of following jesus at a distance then she drew near and stepped back for fear of being recognized she told of inching behind a broad shouldered man and staying in his wake until as she said there were only two people between him and me i pressed my arm through the mob and reached for the hem of his jacket not to grab just to touch it and when i did my body changed instantly my face rushed with warmth i could breathe deeply my back seemed to straighten i stopped letting the people push past he stopped too who touched me he asked i slid behind the big man again and said nothing as he and the crowd waited my heart pounded from the healing from fear from both i didnt know then he asked again who touched me he didnt sound angry just curious so i spoke up my voice shook so did my hands the big man stepped away jesus stepped forward and i told the whole story the whole story i asked the whole story she replied i tried to imagine the moment everyone waiting as jesus listened the crowd waiting the city leaders waiting a girl was dying people were pressing disciples were questioning but jesus jesus was listening listening to the whole story he didnt have to the healing would have been enough enough for her enough for the crowd but not enough for him jesus wanted to do more than heal her body he wanted to hear her story all of it the whole story what a kind thing to do the miracle restored her health and what he did next the woman never forgot as if he hadnt done enough already her eyes began to water he called me daughter daughter be of good cheer your faith has made you well go in peace ive been told he never used that word with anyone else just me after she left i checked she was right the kindness of jesus we are quick to think of his power his passion and his devotion but those near him knew and know god comes cloaked in kindness kind enough to bless a suffering sister
5145050 jesus invitation offers the sweetest proof of the kindness of heaven come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light matthew 11 2830 nkjv farmers in ancient israel used to train an inexperienced ox by yoking it to an experienced one with a wooden harness the straps around the older animal were tightly drawn he carried the load but the yoke around the younger animal was loose he walked alongside the more mature ox but his burden was light in this verse jesus is saying i walk alongside you we are yoked together but i pull the weight and carry the burden i wonder how many burdens is jesus carrying for us that we know nothing about were aware of some he carries our sin he carries our shame he carries our eternal debt but are there others has he lifted fears before we felt them has he carried our confusion so we wouldnt have to those times when we have been surprised by our own sense of peace could it be that jesus has lifted our anxiety onto his shoulders and placed a yoke of kindness on ours and how often do we thank him for his kindness not often enough but does our ingratitude restrict his kindness no because he is kind even to people who are ungrateful and full of sin luke 6 35
5145051 it is better to make mistake in kindness than to work miracles with unkindness it is very important to be kind to ourselves and control ourselves by keeping our balance if we want to live in peace and harmony with each other we must pay attention to our tongue especially when we deal with the poor we must be very careful in talking to them
5145052 if sometimes we feel as if the master is away is it not because we have kept ourselves far from someone
5145053 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport eight gold medals and seventeen medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement

5145056 eight gold medals and 17 medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement
5145057 last spring then russian president vladimir putin exposed the shallowness of the us propaganda line by offering a startled president bush that russia would offer the us use of russian leased radar facilities in azerbaijan on the iran border to far better monitor iran missile launches the bush administration simply ignored the offer exposing that their real target is russia not rogue states like iran russia rightly views deployment of the us missile shield as a threat to its national security

5145108 real madrid offered 90m last summer and milan did not even think about the bid
5145109 this time is different this is the first time we feel that a deal will definitely happen because of the financial situation milan are in at the moment the deal is good for all parties involved
5145110 the move would represent a significant increase in kakas salary on top of the 10 transfer fee that goes straight to the player anyway some 15m chelsea are the club to be at right now they are building a team to win everything
5145111 i know what i want and i want it now
5145112 and lets give the kaka story all the credibility it deserves by ignoring it
5145113 valencia will sell striker david villa and winger david silva in order to balance the books
5145114 my desire was so strong that chelsea gave me the possibility to finish my career in france first of all and at paris saint germain
5145115 i wanted to talk about shevchenko and he wanted to talk about kaka but in the end nothing happened
5145116 i can say that madrid have again asked about kaka
5145117 we will never sell him even if we received an offer of 300million 238 4million the only way we would ever consider letting him go is if it was his desire
5145118 i can say that madrid have again asked about kaka

5145124 chelsea are an experienced side and i dont see outstanding progress coming from a team in their 30s
5145125 im not concerned about chelsea i just dont know how far that team has got to go
5145126 we have got a fantastic squad and that has been strengthened with jose bosingwa and deco and i think the coach was just looking for one more to complete what he thinks is the perfect squad
5145127 among the reserves drilling at the other end of the pitch here was franco di santo the 19 year old forward signed from audax italiano last season indeed the argentinian looked rather more convincing in front of goal than the 31 year old andriy shevchenko
5145128 real betis are hoping to persuade claudio pizarro to leave chelsea and join them in a move that would make him the spanish clubs star signing of the summer

5145135 he knew immediately what ought to be done because hes been there time and again hes been to the region time and again hes been to south ossetia he knows the characters involved and so he was able to move immediately and with strength and with a definition of the issue that others had to follow
5145136 teddy roosevelt said talk softly and carry a big stick
5145137 in much of the world now were talking loudly and have no stick because what weve done is weve so focused on iraq that weve let victory escape from our grasp in afghanistan and in regions of the world like russia weve let the dangers grow more intense
5145138 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5145139 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5145140 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
5145141 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
5145142 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
5145143 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her

5145147 as for my future at chelsea well i have a contract with the club that is clear
5145148 replacing their understanding and goals with unproven talent like bostock dos santos modric and failures like bent could backfire
5145149 maybe unrelated but there was a diary snippet in four four two this month about premiership player who has had a cinema built in his already palatial pad in order that he and his mates may indulge in their collective appreciation for a wank flick or two putting two and two together
5145150 boys when i said we needed to come together as a team this was not quite what i had in mind
5145151 come together right now over me oh come together yeah come together yeah come together yeah come together yeah come together yeah come together yeah come together yeah oh come together yeah come together
5145152 the roars of the anfield crowd at the close were solely of defiance

5145157 the whole family has been shocked by peaches getting married bob has given his blessing from a distance but he wants to talk to her face to face this is her big chance to explain what has been going on
5145158 i dont like wearing it when i play it gets in the way
5145159 bobs told her that he will support her as long as she assures him its a serious relationship and not a stunt he just wants peaches to be straight with him and tell him the facts
5145160 eine gerichtliche verhandlung w re f r die angeklagte in ihrem gegenw rtigen zustand lebensbedrohlich

5145162 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
5145163 i began to live a duel life by day i investigated the local dioceses dug up documents in courthouses talked with a seemingly endless string of victims and interviewed bishops their aides attorneys and priests in my off hours i put in my final months of training to become a catholic
5145164 c tait la m jai vraiment eu du mal me mettre dedans
5145165 i think to a lot of people it means a lot of different things
5145166 but for me im just iliza and i won im a comedian that won the female thing i cant comment on because i just dont feel that in my heart
5145167 embarrassing these shows are the reason america is becoming not such a good place as far as pop culture goes but i will watch anything thats a reality show that has bad editing and a bad storyline
5145168 if somebody said they were going to hippiefest i would go hmmm the name is kitsch and its demeaning it sounds like something you try on and then discard
5145169 when i listen to my early records i can hear me trying to be billie holiday and edith piaf in one and getting them both wrong
5145170 ive always felt i wanted to put my hand in every aspect
5145171 i want to know hey can i do that lets try it why not whats the worst that can happen if i dont succeed ok i dont succeed
5145172 im not the kind of person who feels he has to be successful at everything i work hard at it but if i dont make it i dont so i dont go in with that pressure
5145173 i became much more focused in my career and my life
5145174 it felt like now i had true responsibility to make sure that little girl will not have to fend for herself unless she wants to
5145175 its normal for chinese to ask people they just met such questions but foreigners respond negatively to such questions
5145176 we are japanese but we will give you pins anyway
5145177 i would walk 500 miles and i would walk 500 more
5145178 i dont think either of us has flown on a different airline
5145179 theyll ask me to come down and ill say oh no i cant spend the money to get down there
5145180 and then chris will call and be like oh you want to come up here for this weekend and im like yup my familys kind of like what the you cant afford to come see us but you make sacrifices because you want to see that person
5145181 while we were waiting for hours in the airport i noticed a mother with a new baby strapped to her chest two bags over her shoulder chasing a toddler its hard to remember those days but i did remember the look on her face
5145182 she asked me if it gets easier i laughed and said yeah just wait soon enough they dont even want to talk to you
5145183 i looked over at my kids and thought about it
5145184 yes it gets easier what doesnt change is the feeling that you are somehow not doing it right
5145185 ok except when they asked me to swim across the lake for a swim test
5145186 one of the kids told me there was a 70 pound tuna that lives in the lake that is dangerous and bites
5145187 tunas dont eat humans and there are no tunas in this lake tunas live in cold water environments like oceans so you have nothing to worry about
5145188 well you may feel that way but this is a real fear for me think of something you are scared about and magnify that 100 times that is how i feel
5145189 leave the moment youve learnt what you need to learn usually after just a few months and the firm starts taking more from you than you are taking from it

5145194 we need to collect evidence before we go to court and were not saying were going to court tomorrow but at least with the new law microsoft has to be more careful
5145195 the uptake of office is at the lowest its been in the last couple of years so while nothings put a dent in the armor at this point perhaps there is some crumbling and the opportunity for a lower priced offering to make some inroads
5145196 given its capabilities theres no indication why it wouldnt be seen as an alternative to microsoft
5145197 this is the equivalent to forcing china to pirate the product
5145198 to try and level the playing filed between western products and native products
5145199 they are understandably not happy about foreign companies owning the bulk of the software sales in their own market
5145200 local software products of any kind pay off for microsoft
5145201 once a country has its own software businesses that countrys political leaders will start to get serious about stopping piracy so microsoft might well root for evermore
5145202 the asian market represents a wealth of opportunities but i guess the bigger issue is are people going to pay for software
5145203 microsoft of course still has the lions share of the market
5145204 we dont want to compete with that for media coverage
5145205 we want digital for video games and stuff like that cause of the new halo 3 game and they said players with digital had an up on the other players
5145206 the digital converter was a hassle to deal with but the government coupons really helped
5145207 my moms friends didnt know what they were doing so i had to go over and help them
5145208 truthfully your hear of dtv about the conversion but i dont know what tvs are going to be effected or whos going to be effected
5145209 nothing thats really come to my attention to say a b c needs to be done
5145210 im probably 75 confident im gonna have tv but only because i have a friend that installs dishes and he said ill be just fine
5145211 probably older people the stubborn ones wont do it and then theyll end up with no television so the government should post people out there if they need help the can call them
5145212 golly we used to have a lot of up and down the street there was it was really something
5145213 people that all said around they wanted to live in postville
5145214 before this whole space is for the restaurant and next door is for the store but now share this space for saving rent you know
5145215 i counted 16 empty business places on main street empty nothing in em

5145223 a lot of the core characters are working together and crossing paths again so its so much fun for us to film its incredible its just coming out wonderfully and i think the audience will be very excited
5145224 we bounce back and forth a little bit from present to future and my future character is very different from my present character so its very cool to have the ability to stretch my wings a little bit
5145225 obviously were all concerned about water quality and i think we have some movements afoot to try some things to ensure that the future water quality is preserved around the town of wrightsville beach
5145226 we have found that there are human sources of human fecal bacteria pollution in these waters and most of these areas have been around boat docking areas which tells us that probably some people have been out there who have been dumping the heads from their boats into the water
5145227 we found evidence of this sort of pollution where you see large boats that are docked for quite a long period of time and weve seen here at the public boat ramp as well

5145240 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine
5145241 a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
5145242 reading or composing text messages over a period of time
5145243 allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
5145244 it would help if we had more traffic police to act as a deterrent to stop these offences taking place before they end in death and tragedy

5145250 but wait they were talking about open adoption and its benefits how can this be a bad thing
5145251 this is crap somebody please pull this ad from running now
5145252 hey you know youre in a crappy situation youre in no position to raise your baby by yourself heres how you can get the best of both worlds
5145253 hey we know you are thinking about adoption and its fine if thats what you choose in the end but listen i really want to explain some stuff to you to help you make the best informed decision you can make because hey this is pretty much a permanent deal youre planning to make ok
5145254 guess what theres another choice here and there are a ton of benefits to it too heres how it could work
5145255 yeah there are definitely benefits to having an open adoption but guess what its pretty darn hard at times too theres a heck of a lot of emotions that will still be had by all parties for years to come and you arent going to bounce back from this without a scratch or dent here and there

5145262 t would not be fair to characterize it as anything other than fishing
5145263 he made this statement even before the rcmp review began so who pushed that investigation ahead why
5145264 its a personnel issue that has come to light which the police board felt that we needed to review obviously we needed to give the chief time as well to review the allegations and seek further direction
5145265 my client disagrees with some of the allocation of resources that has been going on and feels that we havent had as good of policing as we could have
5145266 we have no specific knowledge of impropriety and therefore it would not be fair to characterize it as anything other than fishing
5145267 we think space and time are important because thats the kind of monkeys we are
5145268 there is just no time for these two photons to communicate
5145269 we think space and time are important because thats the kind of monkeys we are
5145270 i dont think we can today claim that we have a good story to tell how this all happens
5145271 and it suddenly came to my mind like a flash that with powers of probabilities one might do some unusual but possibly quite interesting physics
5145272 i have to say that i dont buy it at all
5145273 is that the method really just fits data by adjusting a parameter im not yet convinced theres new physics here
5145274 it has led to no new predictions nor is it based on rational arguments
5145275 this work shows that q can be deduced from first principles
5145276 i think a good part of the establishment takes an unfair position towards tsalliss work

5145280 our strategy is not to be the fastest growing or the largest flash memory supplier our strategy is not to spend huge amounts of money building a new wafer fabrication every year like the competition our strategy is to achieve profitability through the efficiency and cooperation between intel and st to lead in the flash memory industry
5145281 well not be the market share leader at the expense of profitability or our clients benefits on the contrary our strategy is built upon delivering systems solutions and unique value to our customers focused on a few selected segments to provide value
5145282 our partnership with hynix gives us access to the cost efficiency so we can get scale and size through our partnership
5145283 our relationship with hynix is quite crucial we will make capital investments and well expand capacity when the market requires us to do so
5145284 i expect the other market segments to grow faster than wireless so in time the markets will be more balanced i expect nand technology to grow faster than nor so that will become more balanced as well
5145285 in terms of future technology we have clear leadership in the nor market we had 65nm in production in q4 06 our competitors are just now introducing 65nm technology we have 45nm way down the path in development and well be ready in the near future our competitors have plans and talk about a rapid introduction of 45nm however realistically it takes a couple of years from 65nm to 45nm
5145286 anytime samsung is in the market place you should pay close attention because it is a very strong competitor
5145287 samsung provides services to consumers on one hand but on the other hand they might compete with consumers in other aspects for example samsung itself is running in the business of ssd and sd cards as well as offering multimedia processors but were not competing with our customers our strategy is to serve clients rather than compete with them
5145288 this is a market where we have a strong product portfolio were providing customized solutions for these applications
5145289 the new company will do much more in mpc innovation
5145290 that is because we have a complete offering including nor nand and dram numonyx will meet different needs of different clients by offering customized mcp
5145291 i dont see pcm to replace nor nor to replace nand or dram but to expand and complement those technologies
5145292 i can give an example from history we have nor flash and expanded the market very quickly before but it didnt replace eeprom instead it created a lot of innovative applications i think pcm will do just the same and will emerge as some memory technology that becomes very exciting
5145293 our philosophy and strategy is to take the best of both and create something better at numonyx

5145367 what youre in choir you cher you can sing ahahaa ahahahahahahaha hahaaaahahahahahaa aarrrghh more homework
5145368 its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english i dont think its broadly commercial
5145369 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5145370 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5145371 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5145372 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5145373 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5145374 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5145375 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street

5145377 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
5145378 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
5145379 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5145380 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5145381 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5145382 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5145383 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5145384 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5145385 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5145386 some days you just cant get rid of a bomb
5145387 i dont believe russia is pursuing a policy of annexation and i also dont believe that there will be a return to the previous status quo for south ossetia and abkhazia
5145388 they lead the country in donations and number of students engaged
5145389 the university of guelphs success can be attributed to the tremendous support of the central student association interhall council hospitality services administration and of course the students themselves
5145390 they all come together to make the guelph story such a successful one
5145391 we hit much better and came out with a much better approach today

5145396 first we noted that aud is not diagnosed adequately during preoperative assessment
5145397 then even if a finding of aud was made before surgery preventive measures were not often undertaken
5145398 patients seem to be more confident in answering questions about their alcohol use in a computer based question and answer format
5145399 anaesthesiologists can play an important role in preventing severe consequences of aud and thereby contributing to an improvement in public health
5145400 preoperative screening for aud provides not only the opportunity to select patients for preventive medical interventions but also allows us to screen large and diverse patient populations for at risk drinkers whose behaviour my become dangerous at some point in the future
5145401 physicians tend to underestimate and miss aud in younger patients especially young female patients
5145402 our results emphasize that the use of computer based screening methods such as audit applied to every patient are effective in addressing these biases
5145403 the enormous amount of well conducted research into aud and its social physical and psychological consequences will not yield the benefits it should if we fail to implement strategies for the detection of aud into daily clinical practice
5145404 their motive was simply to sow terror and to loot
5145405 a person who suffers from headaches that get increasingly worse with no apparent cause should see a doctor
5145406 when the pain doesnt fit into a standard scheme it raises suspicion
5145407 if a patient is not happy with a diagnosis he should seek a second opinion from a neurologist
5145408 i have a big fan base in asia i am impressed with the fans
5145409 i ran a smart and easy race i am ready i finally got to experience the games
5145410 lado que uniu templo de kiyomizu dera e templo de kodai ji ent o posto depois na fotografia

5145415 the facilities the suits theres been some changes to the rules clearly they allow swimmers to be faster now than they were in 1972
5145416 to do what michael has done i dont even think he could do it in four years i dont think anyone else is going to do it in the next 50 years
5145417 i think that michael can be called the best olympian of all time
5145418 predominantly invaded all of the personal computers in the philippines during the early nineties to the present
5145419 it therefore goes without saying that intel corp has a prior right to the use of intel as part of its corporate name due to the fact that it was registered ahead of the petitioner
5145420 fresh weakness in the european economic data and the easing inflation threat given the sharp fall in oil prices had the market shifting its focus to growth from inflation in recent weeks
5145421 this has helped the us dollar not due to any strong us macroeconomic data but more due to the incremental weakness in the other major economies
5145422 markets are sensing that global demand is weakening and that economies outside the us are bearing the brunt of this weakness even emerging markets growth which showed remarkable resilience in the first half is at risk of falling below trend
5145423 we continue to position for the intensification of growth weakness outside the us through the currency markets
5145424 my favorite colour is i opposed the war blue thank you for your support san francisco
5145425 i opposed the war pizza especially fiesta pizzeria in hyde park but i hear san francisco has some great pizza as well
5145426 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5145427 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5145428 all the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes but the lord weighs the spirits
5145429 we are engaged in ongoing discussions with employees at the site in question to address any issues directly ibm is widely recognised as an employer of choice offering competitive remuneration and a very broad range of benefits for employees
5145430 i knew he was doing a lot of work but it was still a big change for us
5145431 a lot of farmers look at their life and what they had and dont want their kids to struggle like that and work those hours
5145432 how am i going to bring my son in there
5145433 thats probably one thing thats helping this particular county economically
5145434 for being the no 1 ag county in the state i find that very disappointing
5145435 you could work there but you werent really a part of the management
5145436 there werent a lot of people our age who decided to stay with the farm
5145437 they would have to pay for it but it wouldnt be like going to a bank and having to start from scratch
5145438 the no 1 issue for young farmers is land acquisition and the availability of land
5145439 wed love to see our farmland stay farmland because its in our hearts and in our blood
5145440 there will be some defaults at the local government level but at the state level its unimaginable
5145441 we viewed this as an opportunity to buy higher yield muni bonds without taking undue credit risk
5145442 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5145443 he told michael laura and i are proud of you our family is proud of you but most importantly america is proud of you were excited for you
5145444 forty one and i were honored to get a picture with her
5145445 once you buy a tool you need to learn how to use it correctly
5145446 i got like 135 access points off the freeway on my way up here from santa cruz
5145447 i think most people would presume that you have permission to access that open network thats become the social norm but its a little unclear what the law is
5145448 i think for most people an open network is a nice neighborly thing to do
5145449 youve given that person access to your home and he can hack your home
5145450 how much do you trust your neighbors and how much do you trust well anybody that can get geographic proximity to your network
5145451 if a bad guy wants to commit a crime he usually wants to avoid committing it in a place that it can be traced back to him
5145452 the next generation standard for prenatal and oncology molecular diagnostics
5145453 it is one of my top picks for the year
5145454 with the 99 detection rate and zero false positives false negatives seen to date in clinical testing we think the test will immediately compete well in the down syndrome screening market
5145455 if you like working for xerox stay right there but we have to change your bracket
5145456 ill take this on but only for an interim period otherwise the work wont get done well
5145457 what value will i have to this company even when i leave
5145458 we have had some pleasant surprises like the fencing sweep along with some disappointments but we are on track compared to our performance in athens it pales in comparison to the significant improvement our hosts have experiencing at these games
5145459 our goal coming into these games was to find new medal opportunities to better diversify where our medal production comes from based on early results in sports like fencing and shooting we are making impact into those targeted sports
5145460 its not heres a check come back in a year
5145461 its very much based on the interests of our faculty and the interests of the company
5145462 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5145463 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5145464 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5145465 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5145466 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5145467 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5145468 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5145469 playing the buccaneers will be good because a lot of things they do have application to other teams we will see during the course of the year in all three phases of the game
5145470 but i can remember when the original building was torn down and when we had no heat but a potbellied stove
5145471 its with great pleasure and joy that we look at all three
5145472 even the hard times because we can look back and praise god for surviving the hard times
5145473 thats our lifeblood and we are thrilled with how many are growing up in the church
5145474 god is good all the time all i have to do is look around at you folks to see that
5145475 when i got out of high school i figured out that my athletic ability although i though i was pretty good wasnt going to take me anywhere
5145476 it basically opened my eyes that there was a world out there of finance and business and economics that i had no knowledge of growing up
5145477 we never wanted for anything but never had a lot
5145478 we really got sick of cold weather snow and cloudiness
5145479 at that point we said before we start a family we want to get somewhere that is warmer a little more comfortable and a nice place to raise a family
5145480 when we went to the beach we typically went to myrtle beach
5145481 new bern felt more like my hometown quaint some history to it
5145482 i really liked the feel of the town and loved the downtown area which is to me amazing wherever ive lived its always been the mall comes in and the downtown dies here the downtown is alive
5145483 i had known david blain through rotary and we talked and decided hed like to have a new person on board and it sounded like a great opportunity for me
5145484 i liked the feel there was some major energy within the club even at 7 30 in the morning
5145485 i said sure ill give it a try which at that point flipped my entire thought process regarding rotary
5145486 i became very involved with everything and i learned to know everyone in the club which is part of the position if anybody has a question they go to the secretary
5145487 were here to help people were here to make some money were here to give it all away to people who need it
5145488 that was not in the playbook when i started it was just a very nice outcome that i attribute to alex for involving me in various aspects of the club
5145489 it has been on the forefront of rotary international for 20 years
5145490 its been a major effort in concert with the world health organizations unicef the center for disease control and many many national government
5145491 we still vaccinate our children in the u s for it
5145492 but what people dont understand is polio is one plane ride one passenger away from being reintroduced anywhere in the world
5145493 most younger folks just dont know anything about it because we dont see iron lungs anymore we dont see people who have been ravaged by it
5145494 its gone from there being hundreds of thousands of cases in a given year to just 300 last year in four small places in the world
5145495 all are contributing to raise the matching funds to help support the end polio now campaign
5145496 every club is going to be engaged in some type community service project giving back to their community
5145497 for two years i was at van vleck as their defensive backs coach and also did the same thing at alief taylor for one year
5145498 before that i was a defensive back for the seattle seahawks for nine years before finishing out my career at indianapolis for two more seasons
5145499 he is very smart and just makes plays he is a playmaker iris is getting quite a few letters right now but i do see him playing strong safety at the next level
5145500 our linebackers are going to be the strength of this defense along with tavaris maxie
5145501 we are going to be young in the secondary with a couple of juniors
5145502 we have a tough preseason schedule it is going to be tough but we are going to have to grow up in a hurry
5145503 he is a hell of a baseball player and because he only got one week of spring training because of baseball he is learning on the job but he has quick release and is pretty smart
5145504 besides singletary we will have colby hines out there but we are also going to play it by committee
5145505 we have a lot of skill guys and we must get them on the field if we leave them on the bench we will be losing something so some of these skill guys will be playing both ways
5145506 that is going to be kind of scary to get that fifth place
5145507 lamar is going to be good but i think it will come down to foster terry and ourselves fighting it out for a final playoff spot
5145508 we have a rich tradition here at bay city and right now raising the numbers of this program is a priority for us
5145509 em fortaleza percebemos forte marcas do que convencionalmente passou a se ver como um certo oligarquismo tendo as pr ticas obtido fortes marcas do clientelismo nos bairros que a partir das an lise mais gerais at podem ser vistas descontando anacronismos de an lise como marcas de coronelismos urbanos exemplifico melhor h quantos as decis es dos bairros s o tomadas por fam lias como ass ncio maur lio e regina e terezinha de jesus e outros santos a pol tica n o se abre para a popula o n o vemos mecanismos pr ticos de participa o que falem por exemplo de fiscaliza o popular transpar ncia nas contas p blicas repete se sem que ningu m mais a considere de fato como medida de abertura de envolvimento da popula o

5145513 weather and driving too fast for existing conditions were primary factors in this
5145514 we havent identified the family just yet but we do feel theyre all part of the same family
5145515 at the time it was raining really heavily and we believe the driver hydroplaned and then the back end of the suv was struck by an 18 wheeler in the northbound lane
5145516 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5145517 it was just a man to man coverage and jon put it in a perfect spot
5145518 there was a little contact jons putting it in the right places and were running our routes in the right places
5145519 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5145520 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5145521 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5145522 things were going according to plan until the crash i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5145523 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5145524 my initial thoughts are that the touch pro is an extremely nice device the screen seems to be more sensitive than the touch diamond and it looks like htc have spent the extra time with the pro refining a few things
5145525 we make out of the quarrel with others rhetoric but of the quarrel with ourselves poetry
5145526 so we sat down to watch this i hadnt seen it yet although it had been out for quite a while and enjoyed it by now it was that time and so it was off to bed i put in a couple of pieces of wood on the fire on slow burn so it would last through the night
5145527 leave it the way you would like to find it
5145528 when the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth
5145529 you dont let god down because you never hold him up in the first place
5145530 when the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth
5145531 pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world
5145532 you dont have a problem with you being born or staying alive now do you
5145533 imagine batman the size of a child and having to overcome this handicap in order to go on fighting crime
5145534 robin i never thought thered be a time when youd have to carry me in your arms like a baby
5145535 much as i hate to do it i must print these photos the public has a right to the truth
5145536 geez when did the gotham gazette turn into the weekly world news next well be reading about alien plants that rob jewelry stores
5145537 sigh if only i could get my arms to bend at the elbow
5145538 so gangland is now calling me a baby well ill
5145539 ill explain that the girl she saw was a cousin
5145540 oh that girl you saw me making out with just my cousin
5145541 cached a pair of skates in the park for just such an emergency
5145542 slipped on a plastic costume i had folded up in a pants pocket
5145543 well social services said i cant actually put a small child in a glass case so i figured this was the next best thing
5145544 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said
5145545 if government is serious about solving some of the countrys biggest challenges it needs to make sure it does not burn out its best talent
5145546 it needs to ensure that it has an adequately funded and properly resourced public service to get the job done
5145547 ms mckay was the first to be killed he told the court
5145548 there was tape wrapped all the way around her head
5145549 a bit of wire made like a noose wrapped around his neck and kim snibson stood on his back and pulled it up lea caton told the court
5145550 if we do it right today we may have a shot at tomorrow
5145551 who cares about what a poor black man has to face every day in a country in a culture controlled by rich white people
5145552 we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye
5145553 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
5145554 if jesse jackson were not black he wouldnt be in the race
5145555 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5145556 its all speculation at this point whether its blue green algae something natural or something human caused
5145557 however with a whole lot of volunteer help with enough time and with enough equipment we can begin to find those needles
5145558 im sure itll be finalized i ran all the numbers and saw your shit credit and your miniature down payment and gave you way too much for your down payment and made your payments more than you wanted but here are the keys give us your filthy car and enjoy your new crossover

5145565 the greedy son goes to his father and asks him for his inheritance the father concedes as the young man hurries off to live his life without a care in the world after some time has passed all his money is gone and he is working a menial job where the pigs are eating better than he is sitting in his state of bewilderment he has an epiphany he realizes that his father still has plenty to eat and the servants are much better off than he is at that present point in realizing his foolishness in wasting his inheritance and spurning his father he resolves to go back home to ask for forgiveness and food upon returning home his father rushes out to meet him and because the son came back there is rejoicing because now all is well

5145569 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
5145570 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
5145571 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
5145572 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
5145573 he was full of faith and of the holy ghost
5145574 being full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people

5145585 adrenaline mixed with saline water is injected through the vagina around the uterus which relaxes the tissues and creates more space the process is known as hydro dissection the tumour and the uterus are removed through the vagina with simple surgical instruments the entire process takes around 30 minutes
5145586 bleeding in ndvh is negligible in the traditional method there is much blood loss because of the large incision and patients take time to recover
5145587 with increasing number of cases ndvh is proving to be very effective the cost also goes down because of shorter hospitalisation
5145588 every year i compete against reynolds and lose by six or seven points and the difference repeatedly is the guys he brings in
5145589 we just want a level playing field kevin is unwilling to play at our level and hes thumbing his nose at the california interscholastic federation
5145590 im proud of what we do and i dont apologize for our success
5145591 id like to think most are simply rumors but in the situations where theres credible evidence we ask for the publics help to come forward with that information and we will follow up
5145592 we told the school our concerns were that kids from various locations pico rivera elisaldez cypress jefferson and sacramento johnson had come to this same one hotel
5145593 it may be ok to do this by the letter of high school federation rules but weve declared it ineligible
5145594 we are conducting the drill the way we should do in case of war
5145595 there is no doubt if the north koreans decide to cause trouble what the outcome will be no doubt at all

5145605 i think the great task in front of us in the next two years is to lift the experience of the linux desktop from something stable and usable and not pretty to something thats art
5145606 think of the way the iphone uses a pure software experience it abstracts away all the hardware
5145607 you can paint anything on the screen because its all software
5145608 there is an emerging emphasis on services that is the engine to invest in free software applications
5145609 we canonical are hiring guys to work on the desktop the rationale is online services this must be a shared platform
5145610 while we can all be focused on making linux the winning platform we need to think about how we work with other people who work across multiple platforms
5145611 the bulk of participants in free software projects come from people around the core we sometimes focus on the rock stars choosing tools in our projects that make it easy for people to get stuff done and get out is a winning strategy
5145612 good a little pressure might produce a better cum shot for us girls you want to give us a good one dont you he just looks down as i can see he is a little embarrassed with a long string hanging off his balls
5145613 once you buy a tool you need to learn how to use it correctly
5145614 i got like 135 access points off the freeway on my way up here from santa cruz
5145615 i think most people would presume that you have permission to access that open network thats become the social norm but its a little unclear what the law is
5145616 i think for most people an open network is a nice neighborly thing to do
5145617 youve given that person access to your home and he can hack your home
5145618 how much do you trust your neighbors and how much do you trust well anybody that can get geographic proximity to your network
5145619 if a bad guy wants to commit a crime he usually wants to avoid committing it in a place that it can be traced back to him
5145620 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
5145621 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5145622 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5145623 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5145624 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5145625 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5145626 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5145627 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5145628 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5145629 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5145630 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5145631 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5145632 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5145633 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5145634 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5145635 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5145636 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5145637 a long time ago in a galaxy far far away star wars movies were fun
5145638 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5145639 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5145640 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5145641 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5145642 no estoy seguro si pondriamos a britney en la apertura pero estamos trabajando en eso cada minuto dia a dia
5145643 ella esta muy nerviosa pero al mismo tiempo no puede esperar para regresar enfrente de la misma audiencia en donde fue destrozada por la critica la ultima vez
5145644 es la plataforma perfecta para anunciarle a sus fans y el mundo que los dias oscuros ya estan atras y que ella esta de vuelta con su vida y su carrera
5145645 ella de verdad quiere hacer esto a pesar de lo que los demas digan
5145646 estar en los vmas es una gran oportunidad para enmendar y dejar claro que ella es la britney de antes
5145647 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5145648 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5145649 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5145650 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5145651 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5145652 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5145653 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5145654 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5145655 so portable medical insurance means that workers can carry the policies wherever they go and receive insurance cover
5145656 but bear in mind the medi shield plan is a key factor that provides basic healthcare for everyone in singapore already
5145657 so there are many different alternatives and options to address the issue of workers healthcare
5145658 more guidelines and advisory especially in the offshore and marine industry
5145659 requires us to rethink our framework and introduce new measures and help industries inculcate this culture of safety
5145660 we will continue to create new jobs so the key is to ensure workers who are affected will be able to find new jobs as soon as possible
5145661 she said you can have them for good luck and obviously its working
5145662 i cant believe weve already beaten the nine golds we won in athens
5145663 dont they get tea at buckingham palace when they get back
5145664 they should tell the queen to get more sandwiches in because weve got a lot more medals coming
5145665 eight gold medals and 17 medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement
5145666 i think from a defensive standpoint well last week the offense came out and got things going the defense started out better this time
5145667 it the first interception was a zone play and actually a few plays before we were in the same zone and i was out of position and they hit scotty for a catch
5145668 this time i was in the right spot and was able to jump up and make the play the second one i just had to stay really disciplined i knew i had the inside help for the safety he the receiver ran a seven yard route right to where i was supposed to be and i jumped it and made the play
5145669 it was interesting because we put so much new stuff in but now we have to ratchet down and get the ones and twos going its time to start doing some more game stuff and start to prepare for the rams
5145670 the first time we scrimmaged it seemed a little faster this time things seemed to slow down a little
5145671 i think that was mainly because i knew what to expect there is a lot of new stuff in the offense since last scrimmage there is so much more to know although things are more comfortable for me now
5145672 basically i had to run up to make the catch it was kind of a short kick
5145673 we were setting up a return to the left so i needed to head that way but when i was getting underneath it i was thinking in my head that maybe i should have made a fair catch
5145674 i thought the twos and the threes did well today
5145675 tyler hansen had a couple drives and a few impressive plays and ballenger had some moments as well
5145676 i think that is because our guys do an awesome job of doing what the coaches ask
5145677 weve been flying around in practice without pads so when we strap it on its easy for us to go out and go full speed
5145678 there is a long way to go everybody always says hey im ready for football but not us we still have a long way to go
5145679 we need every practice and every meeting before that first game there is a lot of ground to cover before we tee it up but well get there but now its a case of really starting to look at the details
5145680 i made some plays today but at the same time there is still a lot of stuff i need to work on
5145681 ive made a lot strides since last year mainly in technique
5145682 farmers are basing their hopes on more spring rains to help them through the season
5145683 the crop is hanging on in most areas with northern new south wales being the region most in need of a rain but if we get average rains over spring we are confident of our current wheat number
5145684 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5145685 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5145686 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5145687 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5145688 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5145689 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5145690 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5145691 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5145692 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5145693 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5145694 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5145695 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5145696 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5145697 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5145698 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5145699 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5145700 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5145701 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5145702 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5145703 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5145704 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5145705 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5145706 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5145707 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5145708 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5145709 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5145710 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5145711 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5145712 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5145713 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5145714 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5145715 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5145716 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5145717 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5145718 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5145719 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5145720 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5145721 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5145722 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5145723 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5145724 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5145725 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5145726 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5145727 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5145728 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5145729 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5145730 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5145731 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5145732 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5145733 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5145734 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5145735 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5145736 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5145737 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5145738 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5145739 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5145740 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5145741 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5145742 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5145743 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5145744 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5145745 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5145746 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5145747 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5145748 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5145749 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5145750 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5145751 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5145752 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5145753 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5145754 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5145755 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5145756 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5145757 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5145758 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5145759 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5145760 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5145761 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5145762 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5145763 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5145764 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5145765 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5145766 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5145767 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5145768 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5145769 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5145770 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5145771 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5145772 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5145773 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5145774 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5145775 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5145776 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5145777 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5145778 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5145779 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5145780 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5145781 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5145782 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5145783 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5145784 who are open to doing something on the production side
5145785 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5145786 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5145787 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5145788 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5145789 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5145790 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5145791 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5145792 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5145793 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5145794 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5145795 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5145796 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5145797 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5145798 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5145799 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5145800 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5145801 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5145802 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5145803 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5145804 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5145805 families are barely making it they cant even afford the basics for their kids

5145818 7so satan went out from the presence of the lord and struck job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head
5145819 you speak as one of the foolish women would speak shall we receive good from god and shall we not receive evil
5145820 shall we receive good from god and shall we not receive evil
5145821 in all this job did not sin with his lips
5145822 i am the resurrection and the life whoever believes in me though he die yet shall he live 26and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die
5145823 yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through christ jesus

5145825 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5145826 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5145827 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5145828 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5145829 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5145830 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5145831 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5145832 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5145833 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5145834 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5145835 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5145836 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5145837 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5145838 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5145839 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5145840 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5145841 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5145842 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5145843 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5145844 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5145845 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
5145846 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5145847 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
5145848 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
5145849 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5145850 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
5145851 then of course theres just so much to rip on
5145852 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
5145853 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons
5145854 apple butter will no longer be a second class condiment dinner shouldnt be so spicy sen mccain promises never to negotiate with prussia and yes if elected sen mccain will vote yes on cats being soft
5145855 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
5145856 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
5145857 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
5145858 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
5145859 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
5145860 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
5145861 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
5145862 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
5145863 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
5145864 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5145865 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
5145866 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
5145867 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
5145868 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
5145869 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
5145870 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
5145871 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5145872 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5145873 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5145874 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5145875 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5145876 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5145877 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5145878 pull the curtains and blinds on hot summer days or to turn off the computer when work is done or run the washing machine only with a full load
5145879 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5145880 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5145881 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5145882 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5145883 change is always tough and electing me is change and it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit
5145884 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
5145885 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
5145886 those are friendships which have lasted me for years and continue until this day
5145887 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
5145888 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5145889 what do you have that has not been given to you
5145890 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation

5145893 when i text messaged with luis we talked about team chemistry
5145894 also he was the biggest part of a team in sacramento he was a star player we need more chemistry and more communication
5145895 wordcount is an artistic experiment in the way we use language it presents the 86 800 most frequently used english words ranked in order of commonness each word is scaled to reflect its frequency relative to the words that precede and follow it giving a visual barometer of relevance the larger the word the more we use it the smaller the word the more uncommon it is

5145897 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5145898 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5145899 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5145900 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5145901 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5145902 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5145903 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5145904 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5145905 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5145906 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5145907 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5145908 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5145909 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5145910 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5145911 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5145912 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5145913 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5145914 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5145915 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5145916 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5145917 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5145918 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5145919 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5145920 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5145921 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5145922 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5145923 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5145924 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5145925 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5145926 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5145927 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5145928 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5145929 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5145930 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5145931 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5145932 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5145933 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5145934 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5145935 people try to put us down just because we get around
5145936 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5145937 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5145938 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5145939 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5145940 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5145941 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5145942 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5145943 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5145944 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5145945 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5145946 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5145947 a indulg ncia n o se ocupa jamais com os atos maus de outrem a menos que isso seja para servir e tem ainda o cuidado de os atenuar tanto quanto poss vel
5145948 whats your sign and where are you on the enneagram

5145957 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5145958 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5145959 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5145960 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5145961 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5145962 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5145963 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others

5145966 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5145967 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5145968 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5145969 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5145970 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5145971 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race

5145975 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5145976 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5145977 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5145978 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5145979 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5145980 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5145981 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5145982 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5145983 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5145984 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5145985 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5145986 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5145987 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5145988 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5145989 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5145990 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5145991 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5145992 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5145993 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5145994 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5145995 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5145996 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5145997 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5145998 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5145999 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5146000 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5146001 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5146002 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5146003 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5146004 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5146005 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5146006 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5146007 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5146008 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5146009 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5146010 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5146011 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5146012 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5146013 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5146014 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5146015 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5146016 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5146017 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5146018 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5146019 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5146020 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5146021 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5146022 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5146023 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5146024 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5146025 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5146026 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5146027 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5146028 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5146029 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5146030 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5146031 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5146032 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5146033 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5146034 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5146035 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5146036 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5146037 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5146038 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5146039 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5146040 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5146041 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5146042 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5146043 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5146044 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob
5146045 i received the backpack last night thank you so much for your prompt shipping i was afraid that i wouldnt receive it in time for my trip so what a relief yay also the backpack is even better than expected i will leave a positive feedback on your ebay and if anybody asks where i got such a fancy bag ill spread the good word thanks again lily
5146046 god then called her to run for the united states congress
5146047 will not have this debate trivialized by their excuse for their failed policy

5146059 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
5146060 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
5146061 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
5146062 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
5146063 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
5146064 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
5146065 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
5146066 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
5146067 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5146068 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5146069 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5146070 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5146071 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5146072 you know its amazing his injury hasnt slowed him down one bit
5146073 although common cause testified on a variety of bills over the two year session only a few actually made it to the house and senate floor unfortunately some of the bills that did make it to the floor thwarted the voters will on constitutional reforms that common cause strongly supports
5146074 one of the most severe budget crises in state history
5146075 im proud of opening the office and helping a lot of people during the 5 years i was here
5146076 mentioned how rhode island was ground zero in the debate on the disparity
5146077 and it was a case that helped project the magnitude of the problem throughout the country
5146078 while we share the district courts concern about the fairness of maintaining the across the board sentencing gap associated with the 100 to 1 crack to powder ratio the proper place to assuage that concern is in the halls of congress not in federal courtrooms
5146079 mollis will be rockin and registerin with wbru in providence on sunday
5146080 young people who register to vote are more likely to become active and informed citizens of this state some of these young people will be our leaders of tomorrow now is the time to engage them
5146081 you cant do this job unless your heart is in it
5146082 that this crime is the worse thing thats ever happened to them whether its murder or being swindled out of money
5146083 my hunch is that a lot of this is new voter registrations
5146084 the move to the democrats in rhode island seems consistent with what is happening nationally rhode island seems to be fitting a national pattern
5146085 common sense would say that the republicans will lose registrations to the democrats and in some jurisdictions independents
5146086 i think a lot of this has to do frankly with the obama candidacy and the excitement he has generated
5146087 i think this is an area where there is a good indication that a lot of young people are part of this trend
5146088 you get to meet all your friends again havent seen them all summer
5146089 busiest time of the year this is christmas for us back to school is always christmas for us we have the most traffic through our store
5146090 depending on their teacher there might be one more thing on their specific list so we just decided we just know well be back
5146091 3rd class travel is only there to scare 1st class passengers into paying more
5146092 you should have called the blog why im a socialist
5146093 the focus of the amended complaint is essentially the sham litigation and abuse of the federal judiciary to operate this criminal enterprise that has harmed tanya andersen and thousands of other people
5146094 she could have played better but she had too much pressure
5146095 i didnt know what was going on my mind went blank
5146096 i couldnt get focused during the final as i did in the qualification
5146097 i was the defending champion i fought hard with the inner self to get rid of the thoughts but it was really hard
5146098 what should i do if i cant perform well tomorrow
5146099 i had been preparing for four years thinking about the preparation i wouldnt be afraid of competitions which should be holidays for athletes

5146102 its foolhardy to do this for results that havent been widely checked unless you have personally checked them and its uncurious as well as lazy not to read them yourself even if they have been widely checked
5146103 a testament to the american spirit that im even standing here before you
5146104 change is always tough and electing me is change and it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit
5146105 but its a testament to the american spirit that im even standing here before you as the democratic nominee
5146106 its hard enough obama its a funny name and who knows what theyre the republicans going to do
5146107 this will be a historic fundraiser one of the largest in san francisco ever if not california
5146108 were very proud of what senator obamas doing tonight this month weve gotten 65 000 new donors and now were going to take it to a whole new level
5146109 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
5146110 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
5146111 those are friendships which have lasted me for years and continue until this day
5146112 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
5146113 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5146114 we have an economy that frankly for the last eight years has been focused on the very few and we have not seen economic growth from the bottom up
5146115 the only way we are going to move beyond these current challenges is not to try to prevent further immigration and integration of our communities
5146116 weve got 79 days before were going to change the country
5146117 i dont need to convince this room of the nature of the changes that are needed weve got an economy that is not working
5146118 a foreign policy that has been based on bluster and bombast
5146119 we are going to go out there and run the best presidential campaign that you have seen we are going to win this election were going to change the country and were going to change the world so keep your stress to a minimum
5146120 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5146121 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5146122 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5146123 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5146124 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5146125 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5146126 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5146127 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5146128 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5146129 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5146130 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5146131 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5146132 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5146133 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5146134 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5146135 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5146136 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5146137 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5146138 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5146139 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5146140 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5146141 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5146142 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5146143 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5146144 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5146145 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5146146 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5146147 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5146148 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5146149 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5146150 the rnc welcoming committees order of tasers has absolutely nothing to do with the upcoming republican convention
5146151 these deadly yet humane weapons are needed simply to protect the safety of members of our community on a day to day basis the timing is purely a coincidence
5146152 in no way related to the timing of the rnc in st paul it simply isnt
5146153 our plan is to finance the purchase through raids on local wmd manufacturers such as alliant techsystems

5146162 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5146163 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5146164 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5146165 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5146166 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5146167 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5146168 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5146169 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5146170 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5146171 yeah there are a couple of free seats over there

5146177 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy

5146182 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5146183 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5146197 that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed
5146198 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
5146199 they went out from us to show they were not of us
5146200 but whoso keepeth his word gods in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
5146201 lay aside every sin and weight that would take him off course we have liberty in christ but we are behooved to never try to take advantage of it
5146202 hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man to include a womans are never satisfied
5146203 my god is a god who wants me to have things
5146204 he wants me to bling he wants me to be the hottest thing on the block i dont know what kind of god the rest of yall are serving but the god i serve says mary you need to be the hottest thing this year and im gonna make sure youre doing that

5146206 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
5146207 whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god
5146208 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life

5146210 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5146211 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5146212 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5146213 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5146214 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5146215 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5146216 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5146217 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5146218 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5146219 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5146220 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5146221 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5146222 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5146223 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5146224 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5146225 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5146226 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5146227 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5146228 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5146229 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5146230 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5146231 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5146232 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5146233 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5146234 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5146235 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5146236 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5146237 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea

5146302 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5146303 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5146304 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5146326 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5146327 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5146328 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5146329 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5146336 of course we d have wished for a slightly better result than places three and four at our home race but the two peugeots couldn t be beaten here the team and the drivers achieved the maximum and kept the title fight open this means that we ll be seeing a thrilling finale at silverstone
5146337 it was a good race for rocky and me we were both quick even in traffic you can see that we ve learned a lot since the beginning of the season unfortunately we had no chance against the peugeots nevertheless we still have hopes for the championship we ve only got a two point gap to marc gen and nicolas minassian we ll do everything we can at silverstone to clinch the title
5146338 in terms of speed we wanted to be closer to our team mates and we managed that we drove similar lap times so we re very satisfied in that respect at the previous races we were still lacking something we know it s difficult against peugeot but we ve still been making maximum use of the potential for audi so far we want to do that at silverstone as well and decide the championship in our favour
5146339 that was a really tough weekend for us my first stint in the race was terrible i had no grip whatsoever i can t remember ever having fought so hard with the r10 the second stint was a bit better but in the third stint i again had absolutely no feeling for the car we need to find out what was wrong and solve the problem before silverstone so that we can drive a great season finale there
5146340 we already had problems with our car in qualifying unfortunately they continued in the race the car was inconsistent dindo capello and i both had the same feeling still we were able to move forwards up to third place at times
5146341 it was a pretty uneventful race the peugeots were able to fully play out their advantage in the first two hours they saddled us with a lap before the situation became a little more balanced we saw a nice fight among our two cars positions kept changing but then alex pr mat had a slow puncture he had to pit a little earlier but fortunately late enough so that this didn t mean an extra stop the other car had also a slow puncture just before the end of the race apparently there was a lot of debris on the track too bad that this caused dindo and allan to miss the podium again but we ll make up for that at silverstone
5146342 i have contested three rounds this year and my score is three podium finishes all on the highest step i am the driver who has scored the highest number of first places so far but im still paying the price for retirements that werent my doing im delighted with todays result although i nearly made a couple of mistakes during the early part of the race while i was pushing particularly hard
5146343 i would obviously have preferred to come away with two wins but when you start from the back of the grid the only thing you can do is give your best and see how things fan out up front and perhaps bag a good result
5146344 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
5146345 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me

5146643 apparently senator obama said yesterday that the supreme court justice he liked least was clarence thomas ive met justice thomas senator and you are no clarence thomas he is a great man a humble man a friendly person who truly wants the supreme court to work for the people of this nation when i met him he was cordial and shook hands with me but really wanted to talk to my son who is in his 20s he understands how our country needs to grow and develop with young people with good hearts i was kind of amazed at how he zeroed in on my son senator obama you should talk to justice thomas get to know him get to know more people like him then someday you might be qualified to be president right now youre listening to the wrong people if we were to elect an african american as president this year justice thomas would be a far better president than senator obama

5146685 cumulative cultural evolution in the laboratory an experimental approach to the origins of structure in human language
5146686 cumulatively introduces ambiguity as single strings are re used to express more and more meanings in other words the languages gradually introduce underspecification of meanings
5146687 is an analogue of a pressure to be expressive that would come from communicative need in the case of real language transmission
5146688 as soon as we do ill offer it but right now we dont as soon as we watch the film grade it and our guys are getting more involved in chicago and well go from there no decisions nothing to announce

5146717 a postmortem has confirmed that the rhino died of snake bite we are now worried ab out the calf as it needs mothers milk we have selected dhongi another female rhino whose own calf is above a year old for the past three days we have been searching for the mother less calf so that we can release it near dhongi if she adopts then there is nothing to worry otherwise we have to think of something else
5146718 the information will help us realise which are the animals that have gone missing
5146719 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5146720 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5146721 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5146722 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made

5146724 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5146725 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5146726 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5146727 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5146728 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5146729 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5146730 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5146731 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5146732 thats above my pay grade i believe in roe vs wade i come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5146733 at the moment of conception applause i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
5146734 i think his comment about a potential running mate that had a different point of view was a typical john mccain hes a big tent republican hes not judgmental against those people that disagree with him on that issue regardless of the view of the v p the administration will be pro life
5146735 the reserves at the site are of high quality and quantity good for more than 300 years

5146738 asking a sociologist to solve a problem is like prescribing an enema for diarrhea
5146739 all the university needed to do to knock me out of action effectively was to issue a statement welcoming me to the neighborhood and hailing me as an illustrious alumnus instead their spokesmen blasted hell out of me as a dangerous and irresponsible outside agitator and all the chicago papers picked up the cue and denounced me as a kind of latter day attila the hun

5146741 he constituted them in the form of a college or permanent assembly at the head of which he placed peter chosen from among them
5146742 by the lords institution st peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single apostolic college so in like fashion the roman pontiff peters successor and the bishops the successors of the apostles are related with and united to one another
5146743 the office of binding and loosing which was given to peter was also assigned to the college of apostles united to its head
5146744 is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful
5146745 for the roman pontiff by reason of his office as vicar of christ and as pastor of the entire church has full supreme and universal power over the whole church a power which he can always exercise unhindered

5146752 when the market is tight and the economy is slow and making tourism profitable
5146753 welcome to the new era of the 18 billion faith tourism industry
5146754 we have lost up to 90 per cent of our oysters to the algae bloom which occurred in march this year and was followed by another one in may
5146755 our insurance company commissioned a study which concluded that red tide events of such severity occur once every 30 years
5146756 now it has happened twice in three months and left the whole industry deeply concerned about a recurrence of the problem
5146757 the asian consumers are very particular about oysters and have very distinct preferences when it comes to factors like size form texture taste and colour
5146758 given the high economic growth in china where consuming oysters is regarded as a luxury and status symbol we expect the demand there to increase and with it the importance of that market to our company
5146759 it takes us about half the time needed by producers elsewhere to grow an oyster to marketable size
5146760 not only must we clean the baskets every month or so but we have to routinely remove the individual oysters sort them according to size and place them back in bigger mesh bags or crates to accommodate for their rapid growth
5146761 until recently all oyster spat which consists of larvae of about 12 mm was imported from overseas mostly from chile
5146762 ive been experimenting for four years with various temperatures and nutrients as well as different methods in trying to prompt female oysters to spawn and generate larvae
5146763 i still dont really know which set of circumstances they prefer or why they die under certain conditions that would theoretically appear conducive to them
5146764 oysters can survive for a matter of days on anaerobic respiration meaning they close up and stop filtering water from outside
5146765 the existing water canal through which we pump seawater from the ocean as well as the pre evaporation ponds of which some are used for oyster production are necessary for our core business and thus freely available for oyster farming but it would probably not be financially viable for anybody to create these ponds solely for oyster production
5146766 currently we spend about 80 us cents per live oyster to have them flown to markets in asia
5146767 that is not really an option for us because of the time involved
5146768 since unfrozen oysters have a shelf life of just more than a week if stored at between five and ten degrees celsius and it takes more than three weeks for us to have samples sent to and tested in ireland the results cannot be used as basis for export to the eu after all any oysters forming part of a consignment destined for the eu would have passed their sell by date by the time one of them has been tested for possible contamination in ireland
5146769 i expect total production in 2008 to be down by at least 60 per cent compared to last year
5146770 in view of ongoing climate change we have to be prepared for a recurrence of the problem
5146771 it only takes about six to eight months to grow oysters to market size so we could be up and running again in a relative short period of time
5146772 the energy sector has collapsed and there is no doubt that it is a total failure
5146773 the government is not doing anything to alleviate the pain manufactures are going through in this country
5146774 i have already suggested that government must as a matter of urgency remove certain obligations especially on indigenous manufactures for example tax
5146775 corporations are conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
5146776 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness

5146804 but there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices
5146805 but while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything that hurts growth
5146806 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 percent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
5146807 there is a new dynamism in our railways new roads are being built many new seaports and airports are being developed

5146825 no human life is worth more than another and no human life is worth less than another if we truly believe that then we have to stand up unapologetically for life against this wholesale destruction
5146826 we should never forget that the manner in which we treat others is the manner in which we invite others to treat us
5146827 if we are a society that makes it ok to slaughter innocent life and vulnerable life we are in essence inviting others to feel that way toward us thats why this issue has never been a political one for me

5146833 the american physical society the leading professional society for american physicists announced in july 2008 on one of its websites that there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
5146834 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5146835 the so called hockey stick graph to support the notion that humans are causing global warming
5146836 to slow stop and even reverse the damage of greenhouse gases
5146837 the science is overwhelming climate change is happening now and human activity is the primary cause
5146838 by now the dynamics of global warming are widely known and we find no reason to dispute the scientific assumptions
5146839 its not appropriate for companies to say the debate is over and the case is closed when it is becoming more apparent all the time that climatologists have no firm idea about what drives warming and cooling cycles
5146840 we think statements of certainly about climate are actually misstatements
5146841 companies have an obligation under current law to refrain from making false and misleading statements on material matters and the sec has been pretty strict about this
5146842 yet when you get into global warming issues its almost like they the corporations have the environmentalists writing propaganda for them
5146843 exelon believes that climate change is real and that action is needed to immediately reverse greenhouse gas emissions ghgs we are already among the lowest carbon emitters in the utility industry by virtue of our nuclear fleet and this year we are on track to meet our voluntary commitment to reduce our carbon emissions by 8 percent as part of epas climate leaders program exelons industry leading low carbon strategy seeks to reduce displace or offset 15 million metric tons of ghgs by 2020 this is more than our current annual carbon footprint

5146846 the ceos have not thought through all of the consequences of global warming regulations on their business
5146847 it means more unemployment higher energy prices and lower gdp gross domestic product and theyre actually lobbying for this
5146848 so long as corporate leaders can insulate their own lifestyles and score public relations points they will continue to embrace green schemes that seek to mollify activists at the expense of investors
5146849 the sad reality is corporate america now leans left and is a major funding source for pro regulatory lawmakers
5146850 greater vigilance is needed on the part of shareholders to safeguard profitable enterprises that would otherwise succumb to costly political endeavors
5146851 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver the pregnancy
5146852 its one thing to take our money and do what they did to harm us
5146853 its another to dismiss our grieving that is the ultimate slap
5146854 the apa should advocate a closer examination of the grief and warn women of the well documented dangers of abortion
5146855 instead the apa continues to censor information de legitimize research prohibit opposing points of view obstruct discussions avoid scholarly debates and promote intolerance of those who are negatively impacted by abortion
5146856 abortion violates the civil rights and human rights of the baby in the womb and then it hurts the mother
5146857 the apa wants to say we are the exception to the rule but for every one woman they can find that says they werent harmed by abortion they could find 10 women who were
5146858 significant numbers of women who suffer serious physical mental or psychological trauma as a result of abortion
5146859 some women do experience sadness grief and feelings of loss following an abortion and some may experience clinically significant disorders including depression and anxiety
5146860 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
5146861 the study has to be politically motivated to perpetuate the myth that abortion is a helpful and positive choice for women
5146862 the study ignores the testimonies of women who have had several psychological and emotional issues after having an abortion
5146863 im holding this sign because i cant hold my two children
5146864 i wish i could put the authors of the study in a room with us and have them look into our eyes and tell us about the report
5146865 honestly if you would have asked me this morning if i was going to run a 4 38 i would have told you no way
5146866 i was expecting it to be more like a 5 38
5146867 i think having bronchitis actually helped because i paced myself on the way up and on the downhill which turned out to work pretty well
5146868 i felt great last year on the uphill climb but coming down i got a bit of heatstroke
5146869 i started kind of throwing up and ended up getting passed by salynda just a couple miles out and i ended up in second
5146870 it was a learning lesson for me last year and i definitely paced myself a little better this year i came into it with a different attitude and go out and enjoy it as best as i could
5146871 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5146872 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through
5146873 but that is how golf goes it is four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5146874 there was lots of golf left and it was too early to give up
5146875 you dont expect it but there is always that possibility
5146876 im sure the lead group felt more pressure than i did
5146877 but when you tee it up you dont know what will happen you cannot control how anyone else is playing
5146878 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the canadian open
5146879 and priddis in calgary next year that golf course sets my eye already
5146880 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5146881 being pain free in the latter part of the year i started feeling confident
5146882 from may on it was getting better and better now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5146883 it is such a profound change as to be almost impossible to imagine
5146884 part of a thriving democracy is having a daily paper obviously we do other newer media blogs e blasts and social networking sites but there would be a huge gap there would be an information gap
5146885 kami sangat senang diberi kesempatan bisa bekerja sama untuk menggarap game ini deal or no deal adalah acara televisi paling sukses terutama di inggris dan kami akan membawa spirit dari permainan aslinya ke ponsel

5146887 this is a major step towards addressing the problems of poverty and underdevelopment in the region
5146888 obamas suggested fix would make it even harder for the us companies operating abroad already labour under a bigger tax burden than most foreign competitors ultimately hurting workers and others here
5146889 obamas proposal would change the provision in which us based companies dont have to pay taxes on their earnings abroad until that income is
5146890 this would diminish to some extent the competitiveness problems the change would create so would a reduction in the overall corporate tax rate
5146891 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport eight gold medals and seventeen medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement

5146893 our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain and we look forward to another great week of british sporting success

5146896 to be silver medallist im really happy it was a challenging time coming to these olympics
5146897 its about time weve been waiting for this so many great athletes have come so close and we were able to pull it off tonight
5146898 man i swear somebody jumped someone got out before the gun
5146899 i think i moved a bit there at the start and i thought they would call it
5146900 i think i false started i moved a little bit my foot
5146901 about 50 metres out i glimpsed to the sides and smiled then i powered through the line
5146902 i want to spend time with my family theyve paid a heavy priced for my 11 1 2 years as the treasurer
5146903 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
5146904 when i had a conversation with him theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays
5146905 you are in a maze of twisty little passages all alike
5146906 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
5146907 how do you put your new cash money to work
5146908 i could have stayed on the porch with a love poem or a daydream
5146909 a late august shower taps paradiddle on the porch roof
5146910 senator says state is a model for nation despite having so many without insurance
5146911 depiction of texass health care system as a national role model departs from reality
5146912 a funny thing has happened to mora since the all star break hes hitting like a star he put up a tasty 4 2 3 4 line at detroit friday with a homer and catch what hes done over his last 26 games 404 batting average 432 on base percentage 706 slugging percentage seven homers 37 rbis
5146913 oh i think weve done all the discussing we need to do
5146914 but i cant let you leave here believing me remiss in my duties if im not mistaken its traditional to seal such a bargain with a kiss
5146915 but i want you to know i did save you
5146916 a testament to the american spirit that im even standing here before you
5146917 change is always tough and electing me is change and it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit
5146918 obama told the group many of them indian and pakistani immigrants that he is not only familiar with their cultures but also proud of his lifelong associations with them link
5146919 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
5146920 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
5146921 those are friendships which have lasted me for years and continue until this day
5146922 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
5146923 the criminals who wreaked such astounding horrors on innocent civilian populations were not acting as soldiers drunk with the fury of battle nor as patriotic fanatics but as chosen instruments of a satanic religion to the service of which they had been dedicated by the systematic teaching and practice of unnatural vice
5146924 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
5146925 open unto us where are the men that came to your house
5146926 had been a male prostitute in vienna at the time of his sojourn there from 1907 to 1912 and that he practiced the same calling in munich from 1912 to 1914
5146927 chose to live in a vienna flophouse known to be inhabited by many homosexuals
5146928 were also to some extent helpful in gaining big money support from ernst ro e hms circle of wealthy gay friends
5146929 reports that he has met two boys who claimed that they were hitlers homosexual partners but their testimony can hardly be taken at face value more condemning
5146930 would be the remarks dropped by albert foerster the danzig gauleiter in conversation with rauschning even here however the remarks deal only with hitlers impotence as far as heterosexual relationships go without actually implying that he indulges in homosexuality it is probably true that hitler calls foerster bubi which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners this alone is not adequate proof that he has actually indulged in homosexual practices with foerster who is known to be a homosexual
5146931 even today hitler derives sexual pleasure from looking at mens bodies and associating with homosexuals
5146932 was originally a school teacher but was dismissed by the nuremberg school authorities following numerous charges of pederasty brought against him
5146933 hitlers homophobia did not surface until 1933 1934 when gays had come to affect adversely his new order designs out of which grew the simple solution of murdering them en masse
5146934 a male who indulges in criminally indecent activity with another male or who allows himself to participate in such activity will be punished with imprisonment
5146935 had defended the weimar republic and who had tried to forestall the nazi threat
5146936 employed the charge of homosexuality primarily as a means to eliminate political opponents both inside his party and out
5146937 although he was well known as a gay activist adolf brand was not arrested by the nazis
5146938 that it could be and was applied against heterosexuals that the nazis wanted to eliminate the law was also used repeatedly against catholic clergymen
5146939 the gestapo readily had recourse to the charge of homosexuality if it was unable to find any pretext for proceeding against catholic priests or irksome critics
5146940 h omosexuals were particularly vulnerable to blackmailers known as chanteure on the homosexual scene
5146941 blackmail and the threat of public exposure resulted in frequent suicides or suicide attempts
5146942 w hen moral barriers collapsed under the impact of nazi preaching the same anti semitic movement that led to the slaughter of the jews gave scope and license to an obscene revolt against god and the moral law an open and implacable war was declared on the christian tradition which unleashed a frenzied and unavowed hatred of christ and the ten commandments
5146943 the inconsistency is not in the bible but in your life
5146944 the reason you dont like the bible you old sinner is because it knows all about you
5146945 i believe that a long step toward public morality will have been taken when sins are called by their right names
5146946 the normal way to get rid of drunkards is to quit raising drunkards to put the business that makes drunkards out of business
5146947 corn hole is much more fun when played by a drunk naked cowboy at 5am in lexington kentucky
5146948 its just that we have no other plans no other opportunities were not tired of it if we could stay open we would
5146949 its where we take the family go for girls night out there are all the fundraisers he does dominic has given so much to the community
5146950 we dont want to let this go we only have a week but we have to try
5146951 dominic is always looking for ways to support local artists and musicians i truly think the downtown will be diminished with the closure of the restaurant
5146952 we always wanted it to be more than a restaurant we wanted to create a gathering spot that people would feel was theirs
5146953 what can i achieve today in order to progress towards that goal
5146954 well you have to be really careful because it can come up high and really fast
5146955 and we just try to stay away from it if it looks like a bad weather day
5146956 encontro com os candidatos prefeitura de s o paulo para a apresenta o de propostas de pol ticas p blicas para a popula o em situa o de rua
5146957 a problem has occured with the disc check the disk
5146958 the overall us dollar trend is turning but today we saw us dollar correction and we may see us dollar singapore dollar hit 1 41 or lower before the up move resumes
5146959 the quarterfinals pit not only the eight best teams of liga but also the eight best homecourt support
5146960 teams need to take advantage of playing at home if they are to survive a short best of five series i am sure the fans will enjoy the uniqueness and excitement of the home and away format which only liga has
5146961 dedicate himself to the service of the poor who had been deprived of the fruits of development
5146962 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
5146963 i want to go on the record and categorically say im all for tourism in massachusetts
5146964 i think its a growth industry for us however were the massachusetts turnpike and were in dire financial straits and to spend the money on these grants at this time is really not fiscally prudent
5146965 im probably a little more disturbed that they had to close the tourism visitor center in lee and charlton because that drives a lot of traffic to our hotels here
5146966 its just like at home if you dont have the money to go to disney world you dont go
5146967 from a taxpayers perspective of course i want the money to be used economically but we like to think that the tourism we draw in would more than make up for the revenue that the government uses
5146968 conceptually i have to admit we do have a tourism office in massachusetts and local groups and hopefully if they really care about the projects they will step up and fund these worthwhile requests
5146969 after a complicated five hour surgery we managed to remove the rare cancerous tumor which represented 40 percent of the childs weight
5146970 he underwent chemotherapy for a while before doctors in iraq stopped it because of lack of improvement
5146971 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro
5146972 we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities
5146973 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5146974 russia has informed us they intend to visit venezuela that is the intention that a russian fleet should come to the caribbean
5146975 i told the president medvedev if youre coming to the caribbean well welcome you
5146976 weve got the helicopters the sukoi fighters and were now considering buying some russian submarines to patrol our territorial waters
5146977 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5146978 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5146979 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5146980 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5146981 both authors lament that in todays world superabundance paradoxically exists alongside persistent global hunger
5146982 so tell me again how it is you of all people know about this pig sty
5146983 buffy ever tell you about the whole stripping in oxnard incident
5146984 i believe that tale was wormed out of her after i had poured an awesome about of booze down her throat
5146985 i told her that so she would tell willow and they would not ask about what i really got up to i dont like it when they worry about me
5146986 especially then yes anyway one of the stops on the magical misery tour was
5146987 im still fuzzy on why we are in this shit hole following rumors of lost slayers
5146988 i mean this looks like a set from one of those bad b grade crap fest movies you and andrew insist on calling classics
5146989 i figured we might land a lead or three here
5146990 as it happens you can buy almost anything in roanapur and anything you cant buy you can get information on
5146991 thats the best part of coming here to search in all likelihood whoever has our girls has an enemy willing to finance our search and destroy
5146992 hey not to rain on your parade but you do know im still technically ducking a murder rap
5146993 if anything goes fubard as it usually does for us local cops might give us trouble
5146994 in this town the cops couldnt care less if you kill someone right in front of them as long as you can afford the bribes to make the problem go away youre here because more then any of the others you can blend in
5146995 so faith on her best behavior in the new town
5146996 actually the complete opposite if anyone even breaths on you funny drop them and move on trust me no one will care and theyll assume whoever it was had it coming
5146997 my kind of mission complete freedom to kick ass and no wringing of the hands afterward still i know why im here why are you here i mean this seems like the kind of mission youd want to leave to robin or giles to deal with busting human traffickers seems a little hardcore for you
5146998 im here because i know roanapur dont worry about the details someone will eventually fill you in on everything that went down just trust me when i say that i got to know this place very well i wanted you here because if im right and we are dealing with women who have been abused and enslaved then even rescuing them wont be enough they arent going to listen to me i need them to trust us and that means giving them someone who they can relate to i want to get this right and that means youll have to do the talking when we find and rescue these girls
5146999 what s the deal x man i thought we were looking for unsavory types
5147000 yes we are and the church of violence is the best place to start
5147001 ok in truth its a little down the list with the black lagoon not in port the only other person we can talk to is balalaika and without dutch there to keep her calm well things might get ugly
5147002 you might want to step back this time of day surprise guests arent very welcome i should of called first
5147003 when i say go the fuck away i mean go the motherfuck away
5147004 you shot at me what the fuck was that about what kind of church is this
5147005 it s the kind of church that dont like people bothering us so fucking early
5147006 yeah that reminds me no slipping me funny drinks i had a headache the size of mount rushmore all the way home
5147007 i just wanted to make sure you wouldnt forget me anytime soon and apparently it worked cause here you are
5147008 actually im here on business i was hoping to talk to lagoon company
5147009 i like breathing a little too much to get between you and revy
5147010 speaking of which where is the goon they werent in port when i arrived they on a job
5147011 yeah for fry face though frankly with what they make these days they really don t need to be slumming for that bitch
5147012 im not following hotel moscow and the lagoon company are like super tight what s changed
5147013 the lagoon picked up a sailor since you were here last a salaryman named rock balalaika loves his ass something huge and dutch has been reaping the benefits of course i can testify that the guy could negotiate with the devil his own self if he had to half the syndicates are fighting to hire the crew to handle everything from simple fetch and carry to more delicate stuff
5147014 like a pig in poop but they still do jobs for madame fry face and she keeps them real busy these days say bet you shell be happy to have you back in town
5147015 dont bet on it the business i mentioned it might bring me into conflict with hotel moscow and i want somebody to run interference if i have to go twenty rounds with ms balalaika
5147016 this sounds serious youd best come inside and well see what we can do for you
5147017 youve filled out my son the eye patch is a new look what happened
5147018 of course maam im told that a person cut in half from crotch to head dies in a very unpleasant fashion
5147019 would this noble soul be the person i have to thank for spreading the message of the church of violence
5147020 what message is that guns dont kill people the church of violence does
5147021 i prefer the more descriptive payback is a bitch and so am i
5147022 this is my partner faith lehane shes a vampire slayer faith meet sisters yolanda and eda of the church of violence
5147023 you re kidding right this is the cheerleader slash ass kicker you were always yammering on about
5147024 that would be buffy im the non cheerleader ass kicker
5147025 yeah well you dont look that tough to me i bet i could take ya
5147026 lets not test that shall we faith and the rest of the slayers arent much for gun play but i can guarantee that they can hold their own in a straight up melee fight in fact thats why we are here
5147027 indeed then perhaps a spot of tea as we get down to business no need to be uncivilized
5147028 as impressive as edas tales of your evening together were i assumed it was a one time thing
5147029 how much do you know about the traffic of girls
5147030 a few weeks ago a contact brought us a video from a new s amp m site heaven itself doesnt have the kind of firewalls keeping this site safe from outside interference but we managed to preserve some of the feed anyway its pretty strong stuff
5147031 they were bouncing the signal off a bunch of servers around the globe but the trace i ran got lucky
5147032 the video was shot at a warehouse whose owners have property near here i thought it might be a good idea to come personally and see what some good old fashioned detective work can dig up
5147033 how can she take that much punishment and still be alive
5147034 either its special effects or its a new kind of snuff film
5147035 that girl can take the punishment she can because she is like faith a slayer
5147036 can i assume edas friends back in the states didnt tell her about the disappearance of sunnydale
5147037 total information blackout still you hear bits and pieces here and there like a huge ass lake where there used to be a major american town i heard about la was that part of it
5147038 sort of the crew that jacked up la were connected with my team we had a major situation to deal with the stakes were high end of the world high the solution was to change a few rules of engagement had we really known what we were unleashing on the world well we might still have done it but we would have prepared better ever since we have been fighting to find and rescue these girls from themselves and more frequently the people who would try and hurt them or take advantage
5147039 last time you were here you said there was only one slayer what happened
5147040 technically i was right usually there is only one i had a hand in the reason why there were two for awhile now there are more
5147041 a very conservative estimate pegs the number at being about 1 of the female population of the planet
5147042 imagine waking up beside a someone youve been abusing who now has those kinds of powers
5147043 dont get me wrong guys most of these girls can take care of themselves but this video proves that some does not mean all as long as any girls are in danger it s my job and the job of the new watchers council to figure out how to get to them and help them out
5147044 arent you making the broad assumption that this little chickie is an unwilling participant in these matters
5147045 yes i am and i know how naive that makes me sound but i would rather err on the side of caution as would you
5147046 whoever is behind this isnt just taking dirty pictures rumors place a few of our girls acting as enforcers for petty dictators and we think that they were purchased from these assholes apparently for a small fortune you can rent yourself a slayer i can testify that slayers properly trained make for a crude but effective military force imagine sending someone who can take that kind of punishment after your foes whoever they may be
5147047 rico could you call your friend in interpol you know the one ask him if he can send you another copy of that report he was asking about tell him we might have information for him
5147048 the human trafficking network is large and finding any one type of cargo can be difficult most of the worlds countries are starting to take official notice of such activities making the profit margin versus risk factor prohibitive
5147049 nice to know you all take such an interest in the welfare of others
5147050 im guessing youre early to mid twenties miss faith no doubt your abilities came to you during your teens and since i can tell youre from south boston and i can smell the gutter mud on you girl clear as day im betting you didnt rush out and start fighting the good fight as soon as you realized how much more capable you were you did what most of us would do you tracked down some old friends for a little payback tell me miss lehane how good did it feel when you showed them how much stronger you were did you enjoy making them grovel and beg for their lives like they tried to do to you
5147051 oh it felt good it felt really good yeah i enjoyed it especially the fear xander has no idea how good it feels but you do dont you what it feels like when someone who lived off of your fear and the fear of others looks up in your eyes with terror knowing that you can do anything to him and he cant fight back problem is i started liking the fear more then the payback i liked it when they were afraid of me i liked it so much that one night when a good friend came to me trying to help me i decided i needed to see that look of fear in his eyes i needed to see it so bad that to this day i wonder why he trusts me enough to work with me
5147052 i see why you accompany mr harris ive noticed he has that effect on people like us
5147053 i assume you are looking to lagoon company for assistance in finding these lost lambs of yours
5147054 that and to be honest the money behind these guys is huge and since the trail leads me here that means i is either going to be working for or against someone i owe a favour to from the last time i was here
5147055 you suspect that the resources behind these men might connect with hotel moscow
5147056 i know balalaika doesnt have a problem making a buck but i care about these girls my friends and i feel a responsibility to them and if retrieving them requires an aggressive response i would hope to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with hotel moscow
5147057 listen to the diplomat youve certainly learned a trick or two since last you walked these streets dear but you know how things are in roanapur
5147058 shes head of the local branch of the russian mafia known as hotel moscow shes dangerous
5147059 xander no offense but demons vampires supernatural beasties those things are dangerous a thug with delusions of grandeur isnt high on my list of things to be concerned over
5147060 ever hear about a little thing called the soviet afghan war of course you havent i dont know what you were doing during it but balalaika and her team of special forces were trained to fight and win world war three they perfected that training in some of the most hellish hot spots of that war and when she decided that she wanted to be a russian mafioso they joined up with her any one of her team is better trained in warfare and combat then anyone youve ever met and combined with balalaika leading them they are a force to be reckoned with i am a fan faithie and id back you against some of the darkest hounds of hell but if you are ever stupid enough to throw down with that woman you better hope you kill her quick because otherwise she will destroy you
5147061 you havent been practicing you cant expect to make the moscow women swoon if you speak like a peasant
5147062 im a product of the american educational system captain its a miracle that i can speak english
5147063 theres nothing wrong with you a few years serving in any decent military wouldnt solve indeed it seems youve improved yourself tremendously since last we saw you
5147064 nonsense such an injury adds character to a mans face how do you young people say it chicks dig scars
5147065 miss balalaika may i introduce you to my partner faith she is one of the vampire slayers i told you of and part of the reason i came out here
5147066 ive never met a real live urban legend before im quite impressed
5147067 well ive never met a real live russian mob boss before i was expecting someone a little less marlene dietrich
5147068 you have xanders sense of humor if not his pop cultural acumen dietrich was german
5147069 sorry she was the only foreign hottie i could think of
5147070 so what brings you to our little slice of heaven did you really miss us that much
5147071 faith and i are following the trail of human trafficking specifically the enslavement and sale of young girls you would have heard about these slaves because the people behind it will use this video as advertisement
5147072 and you think the trail leads here to roanapur why are you concerned about these girls in particular
5147073 the group i hooked up with im remembering how well informed you are so i wont bore you with the details caused a bit of collateral damage while ending a threat to well to everything we activated every slayer in the world every girl of a certain age range who ever had the potential to be a slayer became one ever since then my team has been tracking these girls and offering training when we can and giving them support when they cant or wont come to us
5147074 so you think these girls are more of your vampire killers
5147075 one girl in all the world she alone will fight against the darkness or at least that was the way until my friends and i decided our way was better of course there are drawbacks imagine being a ninety pound weakling one day and waking up the next with oh say your level of combat skill and ability but no training in how to use it
5147076 assuming there are vampire slayers among the group producing these movies why would they continue to allow themselves to be treated and controlled thus
5147077 if they were in slavery prior to acquiring the abilities xander is discussing then they may no longer care what they have become breaking a will enslaving a mind it takes time the process is best done early and as completely as possible however once the process is complete the slave is owned completely the enslaved will sometimes ignore opportunities to escape fight back or otherwise free themselves thoughts of rebellion or violence against their captors become foreign to them
5147078 weve already seen what happens to slayers who were mentally unstable before being activated one girl in particular is responding to treatment but since she is several times as strong as her doctors and has been known to kill or maim anyone she regards as threatening her progress is slow and she may never be completely healed
5147079 im still waiting to hear why you think i can help you and why i should even care
5147080 i think you want to help us because the japanese are still pissed over a recent visit hotel moscow made to japan i didnt get all the details but word is you guys burned a lot of bridges funny thing about the yakuza is not all the full body animal tattoos are for shock appeal some of them are to let people know which demon lord they secretly owe their souls to or what their level of magical training might be
5147081 you think that having slayers as allies would counter a potential threat like that i thought i taught you better skills in negotiation and tactics then that alexander
5147082 no you are here for one reason only you wish to declare war you respect hotel moscow so you would prefer not to fight me since you know what that would entail so you tempt me with the possibility of an alliance in the hopes that my response will make it easier for you to know how much chaos you can cause here before ill be obligated to deal with you and your bodyguard
5147083 and this time dont even think of trying to con me ask me like you remember what hotel moscow is who i am
5147084 captain i apologize ive been amongst civilians for so long i forget my manners
5147085 faith and i are here for the girls you and hotel moscow can benefit from this or you can get caught in the crossfire either way im going to destroy the organization that would profit from the slave trade of these women and anyone and anything that gets in the way of that objective
5147086 so these girls are your friends are they close are you did you buy them christmas gifts perhaps
5147087 i consider slayers friends but even more important i consider anyone that would do something like this to a person an enemy and i intend to completely destroy that enemy what the girls do with their freedom once they have it is their choice killing their captors and destroying the organization controlling them is mine
5147088 so you are committed to going to war then no matter what even if it places you at odds with me with all of roanapur you will still fight this battle
5147089 no i will win this battle ive gotten better since the last time i was here a lot better
5147090 its nothing bad you just remind them of someone who lives here is all
5147091 lethally bad ass someone but youll meet revy soon enough and you can decide for yourself
5147092 sooner then you think i passed dutch a cargo running job the recent storms in the area wiped out the supplies of an encampment and they contracted to chang for supplies he was running short and so came to me i had the materials but not the manpower for delivery so i went to dutch the lagoon left this morning and radioed in just before you arrived
5147093 along with the usual staples they asked for there was an additional request packets of whole blood lots of it type was not an issue
5147094 i thought we were looking for vampire slayers not vampires
5147095 slayers need guarding even if they are slaves the best way you can do that effectively would be to have something on hand that you know can take on a slayer especially if she isnt trained to know how to fight back
5147096 i get it the vampires watch the slayers and the human guards control the compound
5147097 if your slayers are guarded by vampires would the vampires not simply feed upon the prisoners
5147098 they probably do from time to time to keep them weak but slayer blood is kinda potent and im sure nobody here needs to be told what happens of you leave an addict alone in a room filled with drugs
5147099 still would this not imply that your quarry was rather knowledgeable about matters concerning your slayers they tracked them located them have corralled them and are using an effective force to guard them such knowledge should by itself narrow the field of possible suspects of who might be responsible
5147100 these bastards are going to tell me everything about their organization before we are finished with them
5147101 well you might have to ensure they survive revys wrath
5147102 well then lets get out there and kick some ass
5147103 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5147104 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5147105 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5147106 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5147107 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5147108 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5147109 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5147110 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5147111 i had decided a year and a half ago that i wanted to pursue a dream of mine which was teaching
5147112 if shes been in the business for 25 years shes an experienced journalist one has to be careful to remember this is a student newspaper and one must be very careful not to lose the voice of the child
5147113 this is all happening so quickly i havent inked the deal but im assuming its year to year
5147114 my first job is to talk to the parents and the kids and have them show me how the system works
5147115 hey bob yeah im just cloudin with some clients be with you in a sec
5147116 we have an impressive cloud infrastructure and our services can allow anyone to become more cloudy

5147118 bank staff do go through training but im not going to discuss the nature of it
5147119 moneys not that important what is is everyone in the bank staying safe everyone whether employees or customers needs to go home safe and that means complying
5147120 as best you can look the person in the eye
5147121 look at the person if theres anything distinctive about them try to remember it
5147122 if you get a note that says dont hit any alarms dont give me any bait money youre better off not doing it its not worth getting harmed for
5147123 you have a robber in front of you can we vacate them out of the premises quickly we can by complying basically what youre hoping for at that point is you just want to be compliant and to be a good witness
5147124 the goal is to get him out of the bank we dont want to cause any kind of confrontation if he says put the money in the bag you put the money in the bag and send him on his way
5147125 i really cant give the details of what training is done
5147126 obviously we dont want to give any robbers tips on what to do or not do everybody is trained and the utmost concern is the safety of employees and customers
5147127 all banks have restrictions because frankly banks dont have tons of money
5147128 its both for security reasons and because we cant earn money on cash thats just sitting there
5147129 we feel whats most important is the safety of our employees and our customers
5147130 most financial facilities have the ability to get the right kind of counseling person there
5147131 not only is it required for the individual who was the point of the foil but also for the other personnel
5147132 none of us go to work thinking today were going to have violence its not something you can act cavalier about
5147133 we certainly do have resources available were something like that to occur in one of our locations
5147134 we have a comprehensive group of employee benefits programs i think that sort of counseling would be a natural extension of the resources we try and make available to our employees anyway
5147135 im very happy at hendrick motorsports and my thoughts right now are focused fully toward hms winning its third championship in a row among any of our three contending teams
5147136 2009 schedule to be released tuesday iowa gets nationwide date
5147137 i realized i had become a sort of a guru about what one needs to do to make a house into a healthy home so i started allergybuyers com to sell helpful products to people like me
5147138 i have always been most interested in the green aspects of what we were doing at allergy buyers and that really goes back a very long way in my history
5147139 forty five years ago i had solar panels on my house in england my family were environmentalists before anybody ever really used the term
5147140 we have products that if people use them can actually make an impact on the world in a positive way its very exciting to conceive of a business where youre making a profit and a difference at the same time
5147141 we still focus on home products but the impact on the greater community is enormous
5147142 its amazing how something so simple can make such a difference and save so much money too
5147143 the kinds of things that ive been living my life around in my home environment suddenly became more interesting to the outside world
5147144 but its like wow its taken everyone 35 years to get it thats like half a lifetime
5147145 they are the biggest marketing ploy that has ever been hoisted on the american public they should be banned
5147146 they take a thousand years to degrade in a landfill buy a reusable water bottle its so simple to put a water filter on your tap if the water tastes bad
5147147 we like to choose products that make life better but also dont ask the consumer to do anything special or unique to help conserve electricity or water or you name it
5147148 most of our products if youre a lazy person are a no brainer
5147149 so if youre going to paint a room for 20 you could save a whole lot of money
5147150 we dont know at this time whether or not we will win of course it would be fantastic to be associated with ups

5147152 weve got to drill here and weve got to become independent of foreign oil
5147153 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or spouses or their doctors and their family members
5147154 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year prolife record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a prolife president and this presidency will have prolife policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5147155 i am wildly optimistic that skin cell research which is coming more and more into focus and practicability will make this debate an economic one
5147156 defeat it if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice
5147157 can i just say choice and competition home schooling charter school vouchers all the choice competition i want home schooling works vouchers in our nations capitol works new york city is reforming new orleans now has over 30 charter schools in the city and guess what its all coming up what kind of opportunity is it if you send them to a failing school
5147158 i dont want to make money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth but i can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day seven days a week that some people would classify as rich who some want to raise their taxes and their payroll taxes
5147159 by the way if you havent noticed we now have a pro america president of france which proves if you live long enough anything can happen in america
5147160 when i started saying you know were going to eliminate meals and gifts from corporate lobbyists i remember one of my colleagues whose name will be unmentioned who said well where do you expect us to eat mcdonalds and i thought well actually a lot of our constituents probably do eat at mcdonalds so that wouldnt be such a bad thing
5147161 we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue but the point is it was 3 million of your money
5147162 i never think that people die they just go to department stores

5147165 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5147166 we were the first in so well be the last out
5147167 every free independent country can together with nato members discuss when it can join nato in december we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of nato membership
5147168 the security zone cannot be used as an excuse for russian troops not to leave georgia
5147169 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5147170 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5147171 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5147172 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5147173 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5147174 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else

5147182 i think i settled down a lot more as the game went on
5147183 all things considered i thought charlie did a nice job of hanging in there
5147184 there was a lot of adversity they were throwing some blitzes at us that we really hadnt prepared much for
5147185 chicago has a great defense and they do a nice job of disguising
5147186 so it was great that he got to play the whole game
5147187 thats an awful feeling when you do something like that
5147188 i probably should have done a better job of judging the ball
5147189 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5147190 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5147191 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5147192 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5147193 increased photosynthesis with higher than ambient dic dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations
5147194 to monitor the kinetics of bicarbonate use in both photosynthesis and calcification in two reef building corals porites porites and acropora sp
5147195 although these were lower than in the light for a given hco3 concentration they still increased dramatically with hco3 addition showing that calcification in this coral is light stimulated but not light dependent
5147196 hermatypic corals incubated in the light achieve high rates of calcification by the synergistic action of photosynthesis our italics
5147197 will result in about a 15 increase in oceanic hco3
5147198 could stimulate photosynthesis and calcification in a wide variety of hermatypic corals
5147199 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
5147200 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
5147201 i dont understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change
5147202 usually we welcome prince charless contributions to various debates but on this issue he seems to have overstepped the mark
5147203 should the uk change our policy on gm to one that is more liberal
5147204 this was in no way an attempt to lay down a challenge to government policy the princes considerable interests in the environment are non political he simply cares for the future
5147205 the prince of wales is a very welcome champion of farmers not only nationally but internationally as a farmer himself he is all too aware of the brilliance that most possess in cherishing the countryside and their farms
5147206 almost every week i have to do chores and when i open the closet door i have this avalanche of plastic bags falling on top of me
5147207 one day i got tired of it and i wanted to know what other people are doing with these plastic bags
5147208 all you need is a fermenter your growth medium your microbes and your plastic bags
5147209 this is a huge huge step forward were using nature to solve a man made problem
5147210 there is no proof that carbon dioxide is causing or precedes global warming
5147211 all indications are that the minor warming cycle finished in 2001 and that arctic ice melting is related to cyclical orbit tilt axis changes in earths angle to the sun
5147212 as more than 80pc of australian exports are price taking commodities any carbon emissions cost is going to be borne by the domestic producer and exporter and require large compensation under any carbon trading scheme
5147213 this compensation will be seen as a producer subsidy under wto guidelines at a time when australia is supposed to be leading by good example in freer trade for the rest of the world
5147214 all this cost is borne by taxpayers yet where exactly are the benefits beyond normal pollution control regulations
5147215 farmers could be forced into bankruptcy by having to refund money they do not have
5147216 to introduce a new high cost system based on fear and feeding off superstition does not make good fiscal governance when there are serious economic distortions measurement difficulties investment disincentives potential carbon market liquidity problems and a low probability of achieving any benefits in energy reduction or environment improvement
5147217 without a similar cost scheme for australias major export competitors the outcome could be economic suicide for exporters in terms of loss of international competitiveness
5147218 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
5147219 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
5147220 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
5147221 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
5147222 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
5147223 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
5147224 i was getting kind of fatigued but i knew everybody was counting on me
5147225 i was tired but this is what they want to see they want to see if youre going to push through it so i tried to go out there and push through the fatigue
5147226 you cant see him and there he goes hes gone
5147227 big time players make big time plays and we needed all the plays he made
5147228 he was exhausted but every time he just kept going and going
5147229 im not going to grow any taller i mean the doctor told me i was going to be 6 2 but that didnt happen so im just working with what ive got
5147230 thats one where i try to use my speed to get to the corner
5147231 i cut it back and was just one on one with the safety
5147232 youve just got to push though him and get into the end zone
5147233 he will be involved in that decision at the end absolutely
5147234 the little guy can really play he is just small by todays standards he doesnt think he is small and that is half the battle

5147246 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5147247 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5147248 katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation

5147258 por ah tuvimos varias oportunidades de concretar no se lograron y ellos tuvieron una y la aprovecharon s hay molestia porque no sacamos los tres puntos en casa y sobre todo por la derrota y bueno no queda m s que seguir trabajando para mejorar
5147259 el profe brindisi me dio la posibilidad de iniciar se hizo lo que se pudo la verdad no tuve ninguna clara pero hay que seguir trabajando para ayudar al equipo fue dif cil jugamos contra el mejor equipo del torneo
5147260 hubo varios desbordes y centros que no se pudieron concretar por ah con ariel bogado no nos acoplamos bien l sal a y yo me quedaba en el centro y viceversa y creo no hubo una buena comunicaci n
5147261 i was kind of disappointed in the first three races and am glad to finally pull the win out here at my home track
5147262 i couldnt have done it without the support of volkswagen bosch and new england constables
5147263 its a great honor for us to have the jetta tdi cup come to lime rock i dont think lime rocks ever seen anything like it with the tents and organization on this scale
5147264 its great to see 30 young kids and the process of discovery they have to go through to be competitive here its very much in the spirit of lime rock which is a track where a lot of people have learned how to drive the drivers are all eager very capable and have great cars at their disposal i think its fantastic
5147265 en todos los equipos hay competencia tanto en los clubes como en la selecci n entonces cuando la situaci n es as m s que sentirte intranquilo es fundamental para representar bien a nuestro pa s con este grupo no s si conformamos a una de las mejores selecciones de m xico pero s estoy convencido que en este grupo hay muy buen nivel por parte de todos los jugadores que servir para empezar bien esta eliminatoria
5147266 por fortuna he tenido la oportunidad de concretar pero hay que hablar donde realmente es dentro la cancha y para demostrar que se puede hacer una gran labor de equipo para que nuestra selecci n pueda hacer un buen papel
5147267 la responsabilidad de representar la camiseta del pa s es muy grande pero uno la disfruta a la medida que uno puede as que tanto el entrenador como nosotros los jugadores debemos trabajar por conseguir triunfos
5147268 siempre es importante ser tomado en cuenta con continuidad pero el t cnico dijo que los jugadores que estuvieran en mejores condiciones son los que jugar n lo cual me da confianza independientemente de que hay una gran competencia con los compa eros que juegan en europa sin embargo soy una persona que habla muy poco creo que en la cancha es en donde se debe demostrar la calidad de cada uno de nosotros
5147269 uno quisiera que el triunfo se diera de mejor manera
5147270 uno quisiera que el triunfo se diera de mejor manera hay que reconocer que el primer tiempo no anduvimos muy bien y que indios merec a tener mejor suerte pero el futbol es medio raro a veces juegas bien y no ganas nosotros no jugamos bien el primer tiempo y en el segundo mejoramos considerablemente fuimos muy contundentes a la hora de anotar adem s corrimos con suerte porque los postes nos ayudaron ahora
5147271 desgraciadamente oribe peralta no tuvo fortuna es un gran jugador pero parece que se entienden mejor ben tez y vuoso porque son de diferentes estilos ben tez es m s explosivo y eso hace que mat as no tenga tanta marca
5147272 ee alimento del delantero es el gol se le dio la oportunidad de que lo cobrara vuoso porque s que haciendo un gol se va a destapar con muchos m s porque est haciendo un gran esfuerzo el tirador iba a ser fernando arce y yo por eso le dije a fernando que lo tirara mat as
5147273 me hice presente en el marcador pero m s que nada lo importante era que ya merec amos un triunfo gracias a dios se da en nuestra casa y nos acercamos en el grupo ya nos pusimos segundo y vamos bien
5147274 es nuestro referente en la defensa de alguna manera es nuestro refuerzo y no lo hemos podido utilizar porque no ha llegado su pase pero seguiremos trabajando y esperando que esta semana llegue el ansiado pase del brasile o ya est esperamos que llegue el martes a m s tardar se lleg a un arreglo y lo estamos esperando

5147277 desconozco qu mentalidad tenga el t cnico pero creo que lo que queremos todos es empezar bien la eliminatoria independientemente de que tenga ideas diferentes o no s lo lo hay que hacer bien las cosas pues aunque no hemos trabajado con l eriksson hemos tenido un a o de preparaci n y en este tipo de partidos uno tiene que sacar todo el car cter el futbol y todo lo dem s
5147278 todo los que estamos en esta lista debemos mostrar por qu estamos aqu debo reconocer que me da gusto ver una lista conformada por grandes jugadores porque de esa manera te hace ver que no hay un lugar asegurado para nadie para jugar s lo hay que mostrarlo dentro del terreno de juego
5147279 conozco a varios sobre todo a la gente de adelante si vienen con todo ser un buen espect culo para la gente pensando en iniciar la eliminatoria mientras tanto nosotros s lo debemos pensar que en casa no podemos perder puntos sabemos que en la eliminatoria es importante hacer valer nuestra condici n de local venga quien venga y nada m s
5147280 hay que vivir el presente y trabajar para conseguir el triunfo independientemente de que si ser titular o no en las eliminatorias todos lo equipos son complicados as que lo id neo es prepararse muy bien para ganarle a todos los rivales

5147282 well we may make news this morning bob but its not going to be that
5147283 so i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5147284 but i think its likely that senator obama will go first
5147285 i did not oppose the surge i said i was skeptical of it because i thought it was too late like senator mccain i wanted it to start earlier
5147286 hes not judgmental against those people that disagree with him on that issue
5147287 i think the fact that sen biden is in georgia right now speaks to his foreign policy expertise and the value that he would have on a ticket
5147288 i wouldnt give any of them over 50 percent odds
5147289 providing pockets in school uniforms to conceal these items tantamounts to legitimizing the flouting of school rules
5147290 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
5147291 it is vital that councils primary care trusts and the nhs work with parents to ensure children dont end up dangerously overweight in the first place
5147292 i began testing all sorts of plastic until i found my fathers record collection and then i started recycling those without his knowledge
5147293 they customers tell us theyd like a film from woody allen or they want mission impossible 3 in their frame or they want a picture of some famous actor then we will make it here and ship it to them
5147294 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5147295 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5147296 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5147297 they would absolutely have to be at the end of their tether to call the police a lot of parents dont even know they can call the police with these kinds of issues its absolutely the last step
5147298 parents are trying to compensate for not being available they are generally wanting to give their kids the best then the kids just start to use quite bullying tactics and slowly over time they will start to up the ante until they are smashing things and becoming quite abusive
5147299 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5147300 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5147301 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5147302 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5147303 remarkable capacity for self delusion and avoidance which may have explained his conduct
5147304 what could i possibly want to see on a news broadcast in 1080i
5147305 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5147306 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5147307 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year
5147308 this year salmon runs are average but if grilse have good survival we hope that salmon will also have good survival and wed see more of those next year
5147309 where the freshwater habitat is good and where the stocks have been holding their own they seem to be able to rebound when conditions are good but there are still some pretty desperate situations in the southern areas of distribution
5147310 strengthening could begin tonight or sunday and fay could be approaching hurricane strength as it nears western cuba
5147311 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
5147312 im really okay with home school i just hate it when people use bible verses to show why parents ought to home school this lady pulled this on me at family camp this year using voddie bauchams argument about letting caesar train our kids i dont think the bible is pro home school
5147313 i think it is for example the command in deuteronomy 6 is to teach our kids diligently
5147314 what are we to teach our kids diligently geometry proofs the periodic table history i dont think thats at all what that passage is about
5147315 youre assuming that knowledge is amoral and its not we have a responsibility to train our kids with a christian worldview
5147316 yeah but in that shma passage the command is to diligently teach the scriptures gods word not reading writing and arithmetic
5147317 but wouldnt you say that youve failed as a parent if you havent taught them how to read
5147318 no you havent failed you could be an illiterate berber out in the sahara teaching your child to love god with all his or her heart soul and mind and never teach them to read or write or do multiplication tables the imperative of deuteronomy 6 is not to home school your kids because thats not the only way to teach them the word and ways of god
5147319 so youre happy to send your kids to someone else for 8 hours a day so they can teach them and that during an age when they are most impressionable
5147320 i think teachers are generally doing a good job of teaching what they are paid to teach reading writing math
5147321 but there is definitely a worldview attached to what theyre teaching its impossible for them to be objective moreover grade school is when they are most impressionable
5147322 i think my teachers through grade school had very little negative influence over my thinking if they were poisoning my mind it was a drop in the ocean of the influence that was my parents church etc by the time i got to junior high high school when evolution was being taught i was strengthened in my faith because it made me own my reasons for believing in the creator god
5147323 but in high school there are other real social pressures that you cant deny i e drug use do you want to subject your kids to that
5147324 it was just a bad day all the way around
5147325 the pitches they hit were bad pitches they caught too much of the plate and were up you can get away with catching a little too much of the plate if theyre down some days but today was the middle of the plate and up they were just really bad pitches but good pitches to hit
5147326 at least some of our bullpen was rested because of the friday rainout
5147327 today could have been much worse if our bullpen was taxed from the last few days but not a whole lot of positive things to come out of it
5147328 he finished the set got out of the pool and he flipped me the bird and walked out hes stubborn but thats what makes him great
5147329 it took a lot out of me going into the final but thats what i had to do to make it
5147330 it was such a fast event that i knew everyone was going to be tired i took it out just as hard as i could i paid for it in the second half but that was what i needed to do to get to the podium
5147331 the swim clubs are working and the plan and program are coming along we have to keep developing our coaches and help communities open the pools to clubs without being too expensive so more kids can swim longer we want to bring our teams together often for little camps in four years we need to get ready to win
5147332 i think hes the fastest improving 1 500 freestyler in the world over the last couple of years
5147333 if you track his progression hes been on that curve there is no replacement for hard work and ryan dives into the pool and swims hard every day theres no quarter
5147334 this friday because i am stuck at this crazy place with no access to hindi cinema theaters not even to hindi channels i dont think this is fair at all to tell you the truth i have been nurturing some secret feelings for this amazingly cute looking guy
5147335 guy who otherwise always seems to be walking towards you when hes actually walking away from you
5147336 ek color ke terah patte terah patto mein bus ek king
5147337 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried
5147338 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find
5147339 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom
5147340 the medals are won over the winter were in the snow were in the wind were in the rain its crappy out there
5147341 we practiced rising to the occasion time and time again hitting the finish line like that knowing youre the olympic champ youve got the gold medal its an unbelievable thing
5147342 in a fast race like the mens eight its such a big psychological battle
5147343 if someone is ahead of you you cant see where they are even though were hurtin like all get out in front they think were probably sitting out there and smiling
5147344 this race was absolutely painful absolutely incredible unlike anything ive ever had in my life but it only lasted for five minutes
5147345 we put in so many miles on that lake ill still get chills when im 80 walking down to the shore of elk lake
5147346 so many miles so much pain that lake it has a special place in my heart
5147347 everyone is looking forward to spending time with their wives their kids their families its going to be a great fall
5147348 the only thing thatll stop us is ice and fog but if theres only a little bit of ice hell go ahead and break it up with the coachs boat
5147349 i cant very well say its the happiest moment of my life
5147350 i could see it start to cross brians face the dawning of it
5147351 you could see it in his eyes were going to do it were going to do it
5147352 means of reaching those who have committed crimes in the combat zone military people whose crimes go undetected until after they have left the service
5147353 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5147354 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5147355 he can only get a fair shake if those civilians are honorably discharged marines who fought
5147356 soccer moms and pops cant understand the horrors of war or the complex set of rules of engagement that these marines face
5147357 id love for my guy to be tried by civilians
5147358 the jr high our largest project that was our concern because it was a large project and initially we were going to do it over two years but we decided to get it done in one year
5147359 it gives anyone who wants to participate a chance to participate in bowling in this wii game it involves only hand movement rather than any leg or foot movement
5147360 oh they enjoy it if they dont play they enjoy coming out and watching a lot of cheering going on its a lot of fun
5147361 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5147362 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5147363 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5147364 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
5147365 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5147366 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5147367 i had a little bit of hope inside me but seeing how beautifully she did her routine i knew
5147368 i may be a mediocre and miserable wench but im all i think about
5147369 for sportsmen the olympics are more important i win here for a lot of people not just for me
5147370 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5147371 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5147372 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5147373 there was a lot of boxing and a lot of pushing
5147374 i was worried about someone going down but i ran hard
5147375 in the final im not going to be running for a time ill be running for a gold medal
5147376 but i definitely feel like im in great shape i think im very close to seeing a 48 seconds
5147377 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro
5147378 it was a weird thing so i wasnt too upset my ball finished near some trees and i didnt have a second shot and i ended up making bogey
5147379 i struck the ball really nicely and putted solid holed some really nice putts today
5147380 i know i can do a lot better my game is there i just need to stand on the stage and let it go
5147381 i was letting the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5147382 hes done a lot of fitness work but hes still behind all the others
5147383 it seems like the biggest crowd its a great day
5147384 we sold out of everything and we doubled what we had last year
5147385 when it first started i dont think there were more than a dozen if there were that many and each year it gets better
5147386 youve got to come first and try it and youll come back again its good its very good
5147387 they are out of this world we ought to do this more often
5147388 we certainly have the most venders 28 and i think its the most well attended
5147389 its not as if its a theory this has actually been operating in the state of western australia for some time where it has brought considerable benefits to motorists in that state
5147390 we are not debating something thats some theoretical debate it has actually happened in practice
5147391 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wondering all over the place
5147392 there is no doubt that we have not been searching for oil in the country the way we should have been searching for it
5147393 theres a whole debate about how we provide extra incentive for exploration and its very important given the volumes of oil we are importing that we put in place a national energy security policy
5147394 its simply stunning that for the past 12 years the previous coalition government didnt come to grips with all of the questions involved in energy security
5147395 we are very serious about doing that that is why we have got that audit in place
5147396 every single one of these characters is so uniquely interesting to me
5147397 we have spent so much time already discussing who they all are the first phase of the show is finding out why everybody was in australia and why they were flying to los angeles answering the questions where were you coming from and where were you going will be fairly interesting for everyone and the answers to those questions are very satisfying
5147398 lately i have been obsessing on the korean couple daniel dae kim and yunjin kim and then ill start thinking about hurley jorge garcia who is the heavyset guy and he is equally fascinating
5147399 oh no i dont want to bother you youve got more important things to do ill ride the bus or call a cab i have enough groceries for the next couple of hours
5147400 gue pengen roger seenggaknya kasih pelukan buat dia bukannya menjauh
5147401 anakku pertanyaanmu hebat cintaku pada kekek dari ibumu nabi saw ibumu fatimah ra dan kepada kamu sendiri adalah kerena cinta kepada allah
5147402 maafkan aku ya rasul bukan aku tidak mencintaimu tapi hatiku telah tertutup untuk cinta yang lain karena telah penuh cintaku pada allah swt
5147403 ya allah karuniakan kepadaku kecintaan kepada mu kecintaan kepada orang yang mencintai mu dan kecintaan apa saja yang mendekatkan diriku pada kecintaan mu jadikanlah dzat mu lebih aku cintai dari pada air yang dingin
5147404 oh tuhan jika aku menyembahmu karena takut akan api neraka maka bakarlah aku di dalamnya dan jika aku menyembahmu karena berharap surga maka campakanlah aku dari sana tapi jika aku menyembahmu karena engkau semata maka janganlah engkau sembunyikan keindahan mu yang abadi
5147405 cinta adalah melepaskan apa yang dimiliki seseorang kepada kekasih allah meskipun ia besar dan menganggap besar apa yang di peroleh kekasih meskipun itu sedikit
5147406 wahai pamanku demi allah seandainya matahari mereka letakkan di tangan kananku dan rembulan di tangan kiriku supaya aku berhenti meninggalkan tugasku ini maka aku tidak mungkin meninggalkannya sampai agama allah menang atau aku yang binasa
5147407 orang orang yang yakin bahwa mereka akan bertemu dengan tuhan mereka
5147408 qs 2 46 tentang kerinduan para pecinta terhadap allah swt sufi besar jalaluddin rumi menggambarkan dalam
5147409 ada hamba yang beribadah kepada allah karena ingin mendapatkan imbalan itu ibadahnya kaum pedagang ada hamba yang beribadah karena takut siksaan itu ibadahnya budak dan ada sekelompok hamba yang beribadah karena cinta kepada allah swt itulah ibadahnya orang mukmin
5147410 mungkin aku terlalu kotor untuk menjadi pecinta tuhan tapi sejak malam ini aku ingin menjadi pecinta manusia
5147411 baru saja tuhan berkata kepadaku bahwa engkau tidak akan pernah bisa mencintai tuhan sebelum kamu mencintai sesama manusia
5147412 aku tidak menjadikan ibrahim sebagai kekasih khalil melainkan karena ia memberi makan fakir miskin dan shalat ketika orang orang terlelap tidur
5147413 mereka adalah kaum yang saling mencintai karena allah dengan ruh allah bukan atas dasar pertalian kerluarga antara sesama mereka dan tidak pula karena harta yang mereka saling beri

5147415 lifting the fear barrier between the iraqi security forces and the people
5147416 the iraqi people came together in their neighborhoods and took a stand against terrorists criminals and special groups
5147417 the iraqi people rejected those bent on creating anarchy and division amongst them and they became a key factor in the decrease in violence among them in the past year
5147418 the enemy is still capable of using high profile attacks as it attempts to incite sectarian violence disrupt iraqs democratic processes and pit iraqis against iraqis
5147419 progress is being made toward that end but i dont have anything definitive to stand here before you today and relay
5147420 if we were to commit these resources to afghanistan now we would be hamstrung in responding to future threats
5147421 the situation is not so desperately urgent at this point that it requires us rushing the strategic reserve for central command into afghanistan at this very moment
5147422 it is an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed
5147423 we are very encouraging of the pakistani government to do as much as they possibly can to diminish the threat posed by
5147424 if you look at the situation of the past several weeks indeed months there has been an uptick in pakistani operations within the border area
5147425 is it enough is it enough to stem the flow of foreign fighters that continue to traverse the border into afghanistan obviously not and therefore we have called on them to do even more
5147426 how come i have to choose between dark chocolate and the almond o cruel world
5147427 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
5147428 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
5147429 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
5147430 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
5147431 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
5147432 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful
5147433 al qaida is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
5147434 in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped up forward to defend us
5147435 the goal to cleanse the anp is started here at the regional training center
5147436 by cleanse i mean to make sure the people the anp are recruiting and training are good trustworthy people this is the start of that progression
5147437 being responsible for the screening training them correctly and then sending them back out into the community so the people can trust them and believe in them is a huge step
5147438 their previous pay by list system in which one person collects and distributes money for the group wasnt ideal by the time the money reached the students it wasnt the full amount they were owed
5147439 now 17 of the 34 provinces in afghanistan have electronic funds transfer and its effective because it cuts down on the corruption of money changing hands
5147440 this time we tried to hold them responsible for the process
5147441 this not only standardizes the force but brings it up to a certain standard it gives them a greater capability to defend themselves as well as a better image
5147442 we are a team and we are working together and helping to improve the police together
5147443 our country is different because some people linked with the enemy try to join the police this system will find the bad people and keep them from our force the people of afghanistan will understand that
5147444 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
5147445 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
5147446 but by taking an exclusive title and making it multi platform and on top of that replacing members of the team that made the game great weakens the sequel

5147448 what is most significant about this project is that the iraqis are doing this completely on their own
5147449 by the end of the year the bridge will look like it used to
5147450 seeing this project gives the people of iraq confidence in themselves and their government
5147451 it gives them hope for the future it is a light at the end of a tunnel
5147452 these projects demonstrate that afghan engineers are capable of building large scale and technically challenging projects
5147453 due to the popularity of the bridges there have been no attacks on the projects
5147454 each bridge has an estimated lifetime of 60 years so the benefits will last for generations of afghans
5147455 the bridges will further legitimize the afghan government to the people in these areas
5147456 showing that the afghan government is capable of bringing large scale infrastructure projects to an area neglected by 30 years of war
5147457 these bridges will give the afghan national security forces access to the most problematic areas of konar
5147458 they will disrupt the insurgency along the border districts and will connect the afghan citizens to markets health care and the provincial government
5147459 take some reps for the next two 2 weeks and dont plan on being in pittsburgh
5147460 surely two distinct creators must have been at work their object is the same amp certainly the end in each case is complete
5147461 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5147462 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5147463 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5147464 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5147465 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5147466 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5147467 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5147468 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5147469 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5147470 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities

5147477 we are not debating something thats some theoretical debate it has actually happened in practice
5147478 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wondering all over the place

5147481 its simply stunning that for the past 12 years the previous coalition government didnt come to grips with all of the questions involved in energy security
5147482 mercury has been measured in danish medieval bones interred at several cemeteries bone diagenesis is estimated to play an insignificant role based on measurements of soil samples taken vertically and horizontally away from the thighbone at three graves
5147483 our study shows that mercury containing medicine has been administered in 79 of the leprosy cases and 40 of the syphilis cases a substantial number of the monks interred in the cloister walk of the cistercian abbey at phi m show heavily increased mercury levels whereas none of the friars interred in the franciscan friary of svendborg show elevated mercury concentrations
5147484 this is interpreted as originating either from exposure to mercury containing red ink in the scriptorium of the abbey or perhaps slightly more likely from preparing or administering mercury containing medicine in the hospital of the abbey
5147485 the great warming climate change and the rise and fall of civilizations
5147486 when i began writing the book i expected to focus on europe
5147487 but as i looked further afield i realized that for a lot of the world the medieval warm period meant savage issues related to drought with so much of the world currently suffering from the effects of drought this struck me as a neglected problem
5147488 if you look at the warm centuries with a global perspective the wide incidence of drought is truly striking and offers a sobering message about tomorrows world prolonged aridity was widespread in medieval times and killed enormous numbers of people evidence is mounting that drought is the silent and insidious killer associated with global warming
5147489 fish on friday feasting fasting and the discovery of the new world
5147490 it is so exciting to see the abbey and its gardens reopened to the public there is a great atmosphere around the place and initial feedback has been really positive i would encourage anyone who has not yet done so to visit the abbey as many of the most important things to see are within the heart and sole of the building
5147491 torre abbey represents the heart of torbays heritage and its restoration has been one of the largest of its kind in the whole of the westcountry the opening marks completion of the first of a three phased project which will allow the abbey to continue its vital role within the community for generations to come there are a number of exciting new displays and staff are organising regular guided tours around the building during which visitors can learn more about the medieval abbey and how we have tried to blend old and new to make bring back to life the atmosphere of the medieval abbey
5147492 i didnt do it so i suck and i dont want to suck so im going to move my trickle list out of my line of sight like say to the trash
5147493 now is the time to learn something about the business and ive got the bookmark right here
5147494 hey i havent done this trickle in a week why
5147495 i have never worn a chador in my life and i do not intend to start now

5147618 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wondering all over the place
5147619 there is no doubt that we have not been searching for oil in the country the way we should have been searching for it
5147620 theres a whole debate about how we provide extra incentive for exploration and its very important given the volumes of oil we are importing that we put in place a national energy security policy
5147621 its simply stunning that for the past 12 years the previous coalition government didnt come to grips with all of the questions involved in energy security

5147647 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
5147648 we photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth can make them come back again we cannot develop and print a memory
5147649 i work in an herb shop that caters to people who wear navy blue socks with black tevas acid wash jeans and recycled fleece vests over t shirts that say things like
5147650 you have no respect for the people who pay your salary you are completely wasting your potential sad

5147652 good women young and old some who have had mastectomies some who are getting treatment and some who have just been diagnosed have all come out because they want to save our service in sligo
5147653 cancer is a horrible awful disease and it is time that mary harney started thinking like a woman and enhanced our service here where we need it
5147654 our message is clear we are not backing down we are going to do whatever it takes to keep services in sligo
5147655 they are going to have the fight of their lives on their hands
5147656 ucgh is a great facility but it is currently running at 108pc capacity it has terrible parking problems and like a lot of irish hospitals it is suffering from being under staffed and under resourced
5147657 yet from january if we dont stop the hse plans up to 12 000 extra people a year will have to be seen in galway this comprises of about 7 000 from sligo general hospital and 5 000 from mayo general hospital
5147658 we just kept the faith we prepared for it hoped for it and were ready to take advantage of it
5147659 its been a lifelong dream to wrestle in the olympic games
5147660 teammates are walking around with olympic shoes olympic jackets olympic gear went through opening ceremonies and all that
5147661 but if thats the sacrifice he has to make to be an olympic gold medalist im sure hell take that sacrifice
5147662 you dont have any idea what it means to them to be able to contest a final these guys heart and soul is in it and i knew that i had a special bunch when i went down there all these guys want is a chance of winning the liam mccarthy and they have it
5147663 maybe we lacked that little killer punch or maybe the bit of experience of all ireland semi final day but you know you learn from that naturally were going to be very disappointed we were fully aware of the challenge today but we just came up short
5147664 it was as bad a day at the office for dublin as it was a good one for us the goals were effective in taking momentum for them and the loss of alan brogan definitely affected them
5147665 im stepping down after four years in charge of dublin its been a wonderful opportunity and a great journey but unfortunately we didnt get the end that we required this year above all years has been a strange one for results
5147666 it takes engineering and engineers to create the pitch for other professions such as lawyers and accountants to play on
5147667 the whole place was full of smoke i came out before they started knocking on doors
5147668 i heard the alarm go off but it goes off all the time there were three fire trucks i think but i dont know the people who were taken to hospital
5147669 its been beyond my wildest dreams to be here and surrounded by the greatest athletes in the world get a chance to see them do what they do best its unbelievable
5147670 to have an opportunity to play for your country its really second to none
5147671 i dont miss it one bit banging every day you can keep it
5147672 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5147673 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5147674 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5147675 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5147676 workers in the united states are putting in more hours than anyone else in the industrialized world
5147677 we found that not only does that reduce the discomfort that accumulates over the work day it also tends to enhance performance enough to offset any productivity loss that youd expect by giving the breaks overall work quantity was maintained
5147678 the breaks appear to allow for recovery from fatigue so that when they go back to work their work is enhanced
5147679 you can think more clearly perform better and morale is better this is pure science stimulate your nervous system and function at a higher level
5147680 there is a growing awareness that challenging your brain can have positive effects
5147681 every time you challenge your brain it will actually modify the brain
5147682 we can indeed form new brain cells despite a century of being told its impossible
5147683 exercise your brain or else youll uhhh if you think youre going to get smarter sitting in front of your computer or watching television think again get some physical exercise go take a 10 minute walk
5147684 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
5147685 weve yet to find a disease state where exercise isnt helpful
5147686 i didnt have a rhythm on the mound i had to make an adjustment i was more comfortable going to the stretch it helped me out
5147687 i had done it in college this is the first time i did it in professional baseball
5147688 itd be nice if they were all in one year
5147689 when i came up two years ago even though i had some good at bats i felt like a deer in the headlights i just hoped the ball would find the bat
5147690 new media are redefining the high touch experience by creating more immediate personal and relevant one to one interactions on demand and with an unprecedented ability to deliver that attention to detail that is the signature of high touch service
5147691 the needs of time pressed prospects who crave real time contact on their terms
5147692 its true that high net worth individuals tend to be optimistic intelligence hungry and time pressed but that is only a small part of the story
5147693 the ability to access information ideas and other resources on demand is a benefit that does matter to affluent customers the study shows and age doesnt seem to matter
5147694 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless
5147695 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
5147696 in one day youre meeting resistance and theyre not seeing it the way youre seeing it
5147697 you spend four years trying to generate the most compelling opportunities and all of a sudden in one day you couldnt possibly do them all
5147698 is exactly the kind of thing we anticipated but i dont think you could imagine it would be happening at this level
5147699 one can go from rooster to feather duster very quickly
5147700 we understand how quickly a landscape can change in any industry
5147701 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5147702 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5147703 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5147704 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays

5147706 we are deeply disappointed by the verdict and we believe there are substantial grounds for an appeal which we intend to pursue vigorously
5147707 the government has basically never publicly reviewed whether the conflict of interests rules work they dont
5147708 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
5147709 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest
5147710 our work for other customers was entirely independent of the possible nrc standards at issue in the case as it was performed in support of the department of energy a federal department that is autonomous self regulating and separate from the nrc
5147711 radiological assessments of clearance of equipment and materials from nuclear facilities
5147712 detailed and broad based technical assistance on the subject matter of the release and reuse recycle of material and equipment from nuclear facilities
5147713 saic was looking at ways of taking advantage of these opportunities
5147714 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
5147715 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
5147716 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it
5147717 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on january 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the new england patriots from mr orthwein
5147718 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us it is a day that i will never forget and a memory that i will always cherish on behalf of my family i would like to extend sympathies to the orthwein family

5147873 we can put a sign in front of the house and we can cross our fingers and pray but thats not going to solve the problem of bringing a buyer to the home
5147874 i immediately called the listing agent and said whats going on
5147875 it is really a great tool i think in a market that has really swung one way or the other
5147876 if its a strong sellers market it gives a seller the opportunity to really get the most value for their home and in a market like were in today it gives buyers an opportunity to really probe what is the sellers lower level that theyre able to negotiate towards
5147877 truth is there are agents who arent particularly effective at pricing homes or convincing sellers of true market value
5147878 using value range marketing allows them to set the floor at something close to market value while it helps address the common suggestion from sellers to just try it at a higher price
5147879 we started kind of high on the price and then lowered it about a month ago to the price i paid for the home two years ago

5147908 art awakens us from passivity it is a wonderful tonic for the moral sense our moral judgments need to operate in a fully rounded personality alert responsive and compassionate i am not making the case for art as containing moral doctrines a work of art too plainly didactic may not be enjoyable
5147909 moral values are inextricably involved in art only as a consequence not as a determinant
5147910 art is the imposing of a pattern on experience and our aesthetic enjoyment is recognition of the pattern
5147911 the keynote and goal of modern art is nothing less than the disintegration of mans conceptual faculty to reduce mans consciousness to the level of senses with no capacity to integrate them is the intention behind the reducing of painting to smears and of sculpture to slabs art is a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value judgements
5147912 art is a collaboration between god and the artist and the less the artist does the better
5147913 so you see imagination needs moodling long inefficient happy idling dawdling and puttering
5147914 the painting has a life of its own i try to let it come through
5147915 all the time on the lookout for material to make a dream with inspiration means being able to take the hint it is not only a tuned responsiveness it is also an unconscious radar for affinities for what speaks to one by calling up ones own voice
5147916 art is born of the observation and investigation of nature
5147917 illusions are art for the feeling person and it is by art that you live if you do
5147918 all that i desire to point out is the general principle that life imitates art far more than art imitates life
5147919 works of art in my opinion are the only objects in the material universe to possess internal order and that is why though i dont believe that only art matters i do believe in art for arts sake
5147920 art is making something out of nothing and selling it
5147921 no great artist ever sees things as they really are if he did he would cease to be an artist
5147922 the creation of art is not the fulfillment of a need but the creation of a need the world never needed beethovens fifth symphony until he created it now we could not live without it
5147923 there are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot but there are others who with the help of their art and their intelligence transform a yellow spot into the sun
5147924 twentieth century art may start with nothing but it flourishes by virtue of its belief in itself in the possibility of control over what seems essentially uncontrollable in the coherence of the inchoate and in its ability to create its own values
5147925 in that day you shall know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you
5147926 i am the good shepherd and i know my own and my own know me even as the father knows me and i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep
5147927 even as the father knows me and i know the father
5147928 lord you said you are with us forever but i feel alone i cannot perceive you
5147929 listen my beloved behold he is coming climbing on the mountains leaping on the hills my beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag
5147930 behold he is standing behind our wall he is looking through the windows he is peering through the lattice
5147931 i dont know why he got shot i dont know why he went up there i just saw him drop to the ground
5147932 the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them they chose
5147933 my spirit will not contend with man forever for he is mortal his days will be a hundred and twenty years
5147934 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord
5147935 blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of god
5147936 because those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god
5147937 the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of god to be revealed not only so but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies
5147938 you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus
5147939 im sorry but i am extremely confused here and have no idea what in the world is going on
5147940 im sorry i forgot that my favorite tv show is on tonight
5147941 you know what i want stop and see my bartender friend on this block let me call you a cab
5147942 you know im really not feeling well so i should go
5147943 i need to get home because i really have to study when i was on a study abroad that didnt require studying
5147944 i can sense that youve gotten distant and we are already starting to argue so it probably is pointless to stay out together
5147945 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
5147946 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
5147947 they have become familiar with how we play since we beat them in the 2006 doha asian games they know our weak points we could not get our game going even we tried to come back
5147948 the indonesians controlled well but we also did not play our best game tonight
5147949 we have to start attacking we were also under no pressure because we have not beaten them before that helped us a lot now we have a chance to win the gold and we will go all out to get it
5147950 all benefit because theyll include those improvements in the same products and services they sell to the rest of us
5147951 law requiring companies to secure personal data is good a law specifying what technologies they should use to do so is not
5147952 yes raise the cyber security issue ok hire a specialist to advise you or better yet a bunch of specialists but do not create huge spending programs do not create laws and regulations requiring industry to be secure they just are not needed
5147953 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5147954 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5147955 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5147956 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5147957 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5147958 a lasting solution to border problems between cambodia and thailand
5147959 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5147960 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5147961 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5147962 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5147963 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5147964 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5147965 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5147966 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5147967 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5147968 before we know it 45 countries will be negotiating with us
5147969 in a sense the u s will act as indias sherpa at the nsg
5147970 the indians will need to convince the nuclear suppliers group that it should give the same kind of international treatment in terms of civil nuclear trade to india that the united states would have just given bilaterally
5147971 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5147972 in order to protect themselves the british soldiers launched three rockets all of which hit the target unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5147973 the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5147974 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5147975 since fighting broke out more than a week ago between russia and georgia the crisis has dominated headlines and sparked pro georgia rallies across eastern europe
5147976 time for a controversial statement that will get me dugg down
5147977 russias attack on georgia has sparked fears across the young democracies of eastern europe that moscow is once again hungry for conquest
5147978 we have finalized the cmp that will be publicized tomorrow
5147979 we have not put forward any hindrance to reach an agreement and our discussions are focused on the allocation of the ministerial portfolio
5147980 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5147981 remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans
5147982 if i wanted fame and fortune i would have stayed in new york
5147983 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5147984 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5147985 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5147986 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5147987 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5147988 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5147989 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5147990 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5147991 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5147992 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5147993 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5147994 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the
5147995 we are integrating with the iraqi security forces to make us a better fighting force
5147996 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people
5147997 i get more training to be able to do the job
5147998 these deployments do take a toll on the soldiers and their families
5147999 i think its a little bit tougher on the families back home because their loved ones are deployed to a combat zone
5148000 the uncertainty missing all of those special moments with your family i mean that takes a toll
5148001 the department of defense has gone all out to do the best that we can to maintain good connections between the deployed soldier and the family back home
5148002 just knowing that their loved one is ok is a great thing
5148003 we are working to provide them with the additional forces they would like there is a concerted effort by this building to figure out what more can be done and as the secretary said he would like it done sooner rather than later
5148004 at some point soon hes going to make a recommendation to the secretary and to the president on the possibility of further troop drawdowns
5148005 i know much has been made of sort of the correlation between forces coming down in iraq and going up in afghanistan
5148006 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
5148007 they the us have been issuing statements saying they want fiji to return to democratic rule the us has also increased investment in its military base in guam
5148008 globally the big concern is that the region is not on track to meet its development goals and thats despite economic growth and lots of aid from australia new zealand and the us
5148009 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert
5148010 we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5148011 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
5148012 completion of this course will mean these brave anap officers will continue to have a job protecting their country from insurgents come october
5148013 i congratulate you for taking on this very important duty as afghan national auxiliary police officers
5148014 i know that you will serve your village your districts your province and your country with honor
5148015 what do you think there was a man who had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work today in the vineyard
5148016 i will not he answered but later he changed his mind and went
5148017 i tell you the truth the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of god ahead of you
5148018 this proves that jesus is no prophet if god had really sent him he would know what kind of woman is touching him shes a sinner
5148019 a man loaned money to two people five hundred pieces of silver to one and fifty pieces to the other but neither of them could repay him so he kindly forgave them both canceling their debts who do you suppose loved him more after that
5148020 i suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt
5148021 look at this woman kneeling here when i entered your home you didnt offer me water to wash the dust from my feet but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair you didnt give me a kiss of greeting but she has kissed my feet again and again from the time i first came in you neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume i tell you her sins and they are many have been forgiven so she has shown me much love but a person who is forgiven little shows only little love
5148022 cause you didnt come to the mall to see me
5148023 why would i go way up there just to see what you got on
5148024 is that where they are building the islands that look like the world
5148025 en un mundo lleno de tanta violencia necesitamos llenar nuestro esp ritu de mensajes positivos como el que transmite el grupo colombiano pescao vivo
5148026 for a former soccer player its difficult to do this off a monitor
5148027 you cant see plays developing you want to be where everyone is screaming
5148028 the natural sounds makes you feel like youre there and the pictures are great
5148029 if youre not there you have a different focus at the stadium youre seeing different things things your audience cant see
5148030 you couldnt feel the intent of the player who got it
5148031 but in terms of seeing the game and getting replays its just as well that were here but you do miss a lot of atmosphere
5148032 subtle game within a game elements were not seeing i instinctively hit the talk back button a few times to ask to see some pitches but we dont have any control of that

5148039 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5148040 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5148041 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5148042 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action

5148068 o governo e o congresso t m soberania para resolver o que devem fazer achamos que o modelo de concess o tem todos os mecanismos para atender ao pr sal mas se mudar para partilha n o significa que as empresas v o sair do pa s vai depender da viabilidade econ mica em muitos lugares a partilha permite a rentabilidade necess ria

5148073 a partilha usada em pa ses sem uma grande operadora como o caso da petrobras seria mais burocracia e aumenta o risco de corrup o como ocorre na frica para aumentar a participa o do estado basta elevar o royalty

5148089 grenes expertise on accordion and his understanding of irish music
5148090 were not just a hip hop act ya kno im sho alot have figured that out by now but hey like weve given our my space cadets tracks from superstar and this is manchester to so hot and get down and now were trying to get the right track that is inbetween the hype and the slow jam a lil bit of the edge and a bit of the smooth the right formulae to get the right potion to get peeps bodies in motion ya kno ha ha ha i dont belive i jus said that well hell standard im sure youre gonna print it anyway still were trying to get all the audience and if not the majority a bit of hip urb punk er but still ghoodfellaz ya kno so its pretty difficult and you can imagine alot is going on with the tour and trying to get the single written and yat yat yat yat yat
5148091 yo its like theres alot of projects popping up at the momment one of the more exciting ones besides our single
5148092 well the other song is one of a kind so were almost juggling the idea of maybe giving it as sumthing for our differnt type of listeners whore into that dimension and that side of unathordox type of music but its definatley big i mean they are both definatley top 5 in sum of our greatest work and jay will agree hands down mate also were working on a video yes currently working with a producer were familiar with a good friend of jays and mine wasim dont want to give too much away at this point coz things are always changing you know but wait around and keep an eye out for us youll see what happens as we see what happens innit anything else you wanna add jay
5148093 yeah were also gonna be launching our official website its gonna have evrything and weve already seen the first draft it looks super wicked i love it b loves it i hope you love it and we can take this cyber lovin to a whole next level yes please cut that last part out
5148094 i dont belive you said thatmate ahhh mate youre tin you tin mate no youre brass rust mate
5148095 shut up man its early who gets up at the break of dawn nowadays my brains still shut
5148096 we plan to build two lakh homes within the 11th five year plan as part of a new mission towards ameliorating the urban poor
5148097 all civic bodies have been told to keep aside 25 per cent of their budget for the slum development
5148098 siliguri is growing every day new townships industrial estates educational institutions are all happening in this gateway to the northeast bhutan and nepal population work and business will all increase here but amid all these activities the poor must also benefit
5148099 the centre is not giving the additional expenditure even though it is mainly to blame for the rise in prices
5148100 we have taken permission from party president bimal gurung for the strike the nhpc had promised us that the road would be built but work has not yet started
5148101 earlier we did not have frequent landslides but ever since the construction started a few years ago this has been a recurring problem even this morning about 30 40 vehicles were stranded for five to six hours because a jeep broke down on that potholed stretch
5148102 i have not yet heard about the strike but it is time everyone realised that shutdowns are never solutions to any problem the culture of bandh does not help anyone
5148103 the tldp iii was set to be completed in september 2009 but this has been extended to december because of the recent spate of strikes the tldp iv is likely to be completed in december 2010
5148104 the land belongs to the forest department and we have already approached the authorities for transfer of land the process does take long and a road cannot be built overnight
5148105 if the leaders can play a part in expediting the transfer of land instead of calling a strike it would be more useful
5148106 if they could acquire such a big area for the project they can easily do so for the road
5148107 growing smaller and smaller until we take over the world
5148108 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin
5148109 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
5148110 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5148111 i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia
5148112 the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy
5148113 nato never developed military plans to defend central and eastern europeans because we said russias not an enemy and not a threat and we never backed up the new members with exercises and infrastructure
5148114 russia has never been a nation state but always an empire with muskovy gradually expanding its borders since the 15th century
5148115 russia built a state as it built its empire the two were inseparable
5148116 now they are facing problems in revealing what really happened
5148117 how will they explain to the outside world that thousands were not killed after all
5148118 they just dont want you to see that all the georgian homes have been burned down
5148119 in the beginning before the military completely took over here access was much easier for everyone
5148120 even though it looks scruffy it clearly is a curve bill
5148121 there is a roadrunner sunning itself on top of a rock
5148122 umweltpatienten es ist die perfideste form von genozid betroffene die sich selbst nicht wehren k nnen sich selbst zu berlassen
5148123 die zukunft der medizin liegt nicht in der behandlung von krankheiten sondern im erkennen der ursachen von krankheiten
5148124 es mangelt der deutschen gesundheitspolitik nach wie vor an einer expliziten zielorientierung
5148125 keine definierten organisationsformen f r die vernetzten praxen die vielf ltigen und oft sehr unterschiedlichen aktivit ten seien eher als bewegung zu verstehen
5148126 nicht in der lage sei sein praktisches rztliches handeln an der einsicht in die rztlichen gegebenheiten auszurichten der kl ger sei durch wahn hnliche gewissheit seine wissenschaftlichen erkenntnisse seien unantastbar gepr gt
5148127 mittels der evidenzbasierten medizin l sst sich ein h herer qualit tsanspruch sicherstellen denn die wirksamkeit eines arzneimittels oder einer therapieform muss durch belege das hei t durch eine ausreichende evidenz in form von wissenschaftlichen untersuchungen nachgewiesen sein
5148128 in the fall your not going to have time to do anything your going to be so tired and stressed better relax while you can now
5148129 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5148130 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5148131 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5148132 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5148133 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5148134 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5148135 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5148136 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5148137 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5148138 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5148139 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination

5148144 i kept telling them dont give up and we fought hard
5148145 somewhere to boot the rainbow that watson linked into the descant sufficient so anathemize bleakness hereinafter a swindle and stocks electric guitar
5148146 some days you just cant get rid of a bomb
5148147 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody

5148187 david garrard averaged 15 4 fantasy points a game last year he played only 12 games in a 16 game season that equals 246 points which would have been 10th best in the nfl last year if you take out the colts game in which he was injured early garrard averaged 16 6 points a game over a 16 game season thats 265 6 points which would have been as much as matt hasselbeck and more than carson palmer tied for eighth best among quarterbacks
5148188 garrard has a major correction coming the extra interceptions mean that drives that continued in 2007 with additional passing yards and eventual touchdowns will instead end in 2008

5148196 we work as a nationally registered entity in other words we dont come into the country as an outsider we have an febc entity registered inside the country and that makes a great deal of difference at a time like this when the government is beginning to clamp down and curtail what they perceive to be foreign missionary activity
5148197 were hoping to open and operate two fm radio stations in amity and astana we have been granted the broadcast license but we dont have the specific frequencies yet to actually open the stations and actually go on the air
5148198 you can wait just a few weeks sometimes it can take months and unfortunately it can take years we have already been in these discussions for about two to three years and were hoping that something is going to happen very soon
5148199 were going to stream it on the internet and make it available for those in the country that have internet access so that we can begin showing the government that were serious and that were making good programming
5148200 surprisingly more people in kazakhstan speak russian than they speak kazakh but there is a growing nationalistic trend in kazakhstan that means the kazakh language will become more and more used and more and more influential
5148201 our programming will be a mixture of russian programming but we will also be making kazakh for those who are kazakh speakers

5148206 the estimates right now from the unhcr is that at least 100 000 people have fled both to the south and the north the good news is that world vision is on the ground in both directions
5148207 many many families have been separated were seeing that on the ground theres a need that goes beyond the basics and especially for the children world vision wants to make sure that they have safe places to go to talk about what theyve experienced to start playing and having a normal routine again and thats why were setting up these child friendly spaces
5148208 the humanitarian needs here are growing exponentially faster than the combined agencies can keep up
5148209 we continue to look at the tip of the iceberg
5148210 world vision is especially concerned about the longer term needs of children who have seen and experienced the horrors of war
5148211 in addition school is starting in two weeks so we are considering how best to assist children as they start the academic year in communities where they have been given temporary shelter

5148241 i know the market trends numbers whats happening on the street i use it all to my clients advantage
5148242 listening closely to my clients is the most important step to meeting their needs
5148243 the lanes are very narrow in this slum and yet we are quite comfortable here but in the past our life was not like it is today
5148244 as recently as two and a half years ago there was rubbish and sickness everywhere
5148245 if we hadnt addressed these problems those girls who are now working with us wouldnt have had these opportunities
5148246 now they are able to go to school continue their education and work with us this is a plus point for us
5148247 if some of us 10 to 12 girls get together then we become very powerful
5148248 if we unite then i think we can solve any problem we will face
5148249 my mother had no rights in any decision making but i have some
5148250 we are more aware of our rights and our needs than our mothers ever were
5148251 girls like me are getting at least twice as many opportunities as our mothers had i hope that the future generation of bangladeshi girls will at least get that much again
5148252 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
5148253 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
5148254 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
5148255 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
5148256 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
5148257 the thing we need to look at is managing risk whether placing an investment on this versus that and whats the payoff of that investment
5148258 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5148259 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5148260 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5148261 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5148262 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5148263 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5148264 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5148265 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5148266 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5148267 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5148268 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5148269 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5148270 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5148271 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5148272 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5148273 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5148274 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5148275 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5148276 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5148277 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5148278 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5148279 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5148280 a good password is the most important part of internet security
5148281 its the beginning and end of the issue you cant stop it hacking you do what you can do to prevent it you just try to stop most of it
5148282 there are programs that do brute force attacks with dictionary words and approach it from every angle
5148283 its based on what people have been known to do
5148284 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5148285 i bet he hasnt got a smile on his face like that any more
5148286 its almost like weve got two things to worry about the media trial and the police they actually impact on each other hugely which is scary and its not fair on tony

5148293 sex lies at the root of life and we can never learn reverence for life until we learn reverence for sex
5148294 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5148295 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5148296 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5148297 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5148298 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5148299 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5148300 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5148301 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5148302 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5148303 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5148304 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5148305 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5148306 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank

5148309 we are looking for video art which today is already part of tomorrows breeding ground
5148310 always had the advantage as a kind of film festival for video art of being able to provide a realistic assessment of the current filmic state of development of this genre that is what defines its function as an aesthetic gauge
5148311 we are happy about the attention and broad recognition from the specialist audience we have received in the last years for our pioneering work in this field where so far only a small number of convincing approaches have been found
5148312 after the u s game we were still exactly in the drivers seat in terms of what we had planned coming in there
5148313 obviously it would have been nice to be 4 0 after that one but it didnt work out that way
5148314 but 3 1 was good enough the venezuela game right now is the one thats kind of stinging us its the olympics for heavens sake and every inning counts every pitch counts and weve played a lot more pitches well than we havent but its not showing up obviously
5148315 were completely aware we havent necessarily scored a ton of runs but we also know were capable of doing that
5148316 we did put the bat on the ball and unfortunately theyre not falling for us now but thats the first step to getting them to fall

5148324 how we burned in the prison camps later thinking what would things have been like if every police operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive if during periods of mass arrests people had not simply sat there in their lairs paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase but had understood they had nothing to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever was at hand the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and notwithstanding all of stalins thirst the cursed machine would have ground to a halt

5148331 the same old folks that brought you the same team
5148332 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5148333 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5148334 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5148335 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5148336 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5148337 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5148338 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5148339 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5148340 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5148341 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
5148342 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

5148345 we are doing everything in our power to make sure this doesnt happen again

5148349 my employer was very impressed with the designing the application area and the technology that i used in my masters degree project
5148350 many companies are still trying to adopt the technology that i used the program is oriented toward problem solving and each course gave me a lot of experience in thinking out of the box and approaching problems
5148351 it has surprised me that we have seen as much mainframe sales as we have lately
5148352 our students do internships and collaborative research at intel research seattle
5148353 ditto for microsoft research and google seattle and adobe seattle this extensive industry research involvement takes place throughout their graduate careers our faculty are involved with these companies too so the engagement is an integral part of the students life not something on the side
5148354 what is becoming clearer and clearer about the san francisco network fiasco is that blame aplenty exists
5148355 will continue to operate and deliver for the next two years
5148356 we emphasize that security is never a black and white issue but a trade off issue
5148357 the class discussions about it management were literally like listening to a narrative of my day to day encounters at work
5148358 we keep hearing from the industry that tech people cant communicate
5148359 so we wanted to improve our courses on providing as much opportunity as possible for students to carry out not just written but oral communications
5148360 i have a tool belt that i built over two years of the program so i know what to focus on
5148361 i was employed full time during my study in the program
5148362 the flexibility of the program allowed me to pursue the degree without putting a halt to my career development and the impact on my work schedule due to coursework was minimal my boss at that time was very supportive in helping me by proctoring my exams but i never had to take time off to travel for school
5148363 ebay operates on one technology platform and to the extent that ebay has to change its business model in other countries it would change it everywhere
5148364 if we have to change our business in relation to the tribunal de commerces ruling it will be a massive undertaking
5148365 we dont view it as just affecting ebay france but affecting all ebay sites globally
5148366 the work in india has moved up the value chain
5148367 there is a full investigation under way to find out who is behind this
5148368 a significant number of unauthorized transactions had been made using wells fargos codes
5148369 if you step back and look at it a logical move for a company whose technology is going into decline would be to merge with or be sold to another company
5148370 the reason why i didnt see the writing on the wall when the best thing to do was to sell the company is probably the same reason why i built the company in the first place
5148371 its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software
5148372 we have a phenomenal blend of free software that allows for the creation of an incredible computing environment
5148373 im all for the free and open source movements because they create competition but saying that commercial software subjugates the user is way over the top
5148374 the important freedom i enjoy is being free to embrace all forms of creative endeavor to eschew one over the other because it is proprietary verges on the irrational to insist that only your point of view is correct is a form of arrogance to claim that its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software is foolishness i detest fanaticism in any form
5148375 i read the column and was struck by the hostility of it
5148376 its main topic is that you think my views are over the top
5148377 are counting on the legal system to protect their shoddy work
5148378 anyone who says otherwise is invited to read the constitution
5148379 when you discover major flaws in a system you go to the people who own the system and work with them
5148380 you dont stand up on a podium and say look how clever i am
5148381 not to make headlines or sell tickets to security conferences
5148382 this program is really geared toward people who have no background in technology
5148383 i wanted to be able to use this degree and enter any field i wanted to and not necessarily be tied to my biology degree and have to enter science
5148384 there was too much homogeneity in the computer science program
5148385 weve even had a classical pianist major in our program
5148386 are on the same page by the end of the first semester
5148387 ive been very happy with the program its a great learning environment
5148388 whats very important about this program is how challenging it is
5148389 the program doesnt baby you the faculty expect you to take the initiative to teach yourself it forces you to stand on your own
5148390 that kind of assignment is usually reserved for people with more experience
5148391 but the program at rpi gave me a leg up and i was able to hit the ground running
5148392 students love it because theyre working on something thats real and that companies need
5148393 i literally use the skills i learned every day on the job
5148394 the career development center faculty and advisers take a personal interest in helping you achieve your goals
5148395 change or ill get someone else who can actually do your job
5148396 even though i was focusing on next generation security for the internet
5148397 they put me in a position where i could help companies solve security problems they have today
5148398 we push more of that practical model and what we require in the curriculum is foundational computer science skills
5148399 theres a lot more to school than courses and academics
5148400 when i talk to the lawyers here they understand some of the technology implications and i understand enough about the legal implications so together we can construct legal documents
5148401 it comes back to being a well rounded person versus taking as many technology courses as i could
5148402 from an overall value standpoint i thought georgia state offered the best value
5148403 the case studies that were being discussed in the classroom broadened my vision in the business world
5148404 they give you a lot of choices you can either take more technical classes or more management classes
5148405 you cant expect that kind of choice from a two year full time graduate school where they tell you what courses to take
5148406 one of the things we find from our board of advisers is a shift away from things like marketing and financial systems and more of a move into a process view of a firm
5148407 if i wasnt in this school i wouldnt have landed this job
5148408 it had such a good reputation i didnt even need to see it
5148409 i was able to just hit the ground running even my first week in
5148410 information technologies by improving our real time understanding of production processes and of the vagaries of consumer demand are reducing the degree of uncertainty and hence risk
5148411 those classes really help me when i need to work with customers and gain collaboration on projects
5148412 we were covering security courses in 2002 and then we got active in the national push to beef up in this area both in research and in education
5148413 we put together an information security lab that gives people hands on experience as well as theory we evolved from there
5148414 im in a different sector at northrop grumman since graduation
5148415 and the move came with a nice 29 pay increase
5148416 id already reached some it leadership positions and i felt this could help propel me to the next level
5148417 oftentimes the stuff that i studied on saturday in class i could put into effect in the office on monday
5148418 it definitely gives you the leverage to move forward in your organization
5148419 reminded me that there are millions of people who live in these types of conditions every day and that opened my eyes
5148420 we did these things in class during our capstone projects at mcintire
5148421 if id not had this graduate degree under my belt i absolutely would not have gotten this job
5148422 i had no international economic development background or microfinance experience but i feel like ive been able to make a big impact so far
5148423 one of the things we did in the creation of the school was to come at it from an interdisciplinary approach
5148424 doesnt just pay lip service to interdisciplinary education they live it they do it
5148425 they didnt just e mail me back with yes or no responses to my questions
5148426 i felt we were practically applying our thoughts and research to difficult problems it was the creative aspect that stood out for me
5148427 now when i send r sum s to places like that im taken fairly seriously
5148428 its hard to put a price tag on a solid educational background
5148429 the informatics program sets people up for success were trying to create these next generation technologists and theres just unbelievable demand for that now
5148430 theres a one dimensionality in a lot of people who specialize in a field but when you try to talk with them about something different theyre out of their depth
5148431 they know things you dont know and you need to be respectful of what they want to do
5148432 we want to serve as role models for integrating computer science across multiple disciplines in innovative ways
5148433 i found it helpful to branch out into these other areas
5148434 those perspectives are brought to bear on how people interact with the world and with technology
5148435 this gives students in research mode a very strong motivation to learn and develop their presentation skills
5148436 generally if you look at democrats in nevada who are able to win they tend to be far more centrist in their policies than senator obama and i believe the match up that you have between senator mccain and senator obama is one that favors us
5148437 obama wants us to fill our tires to prevent oil drilling
5148438 his tire gauge plan is out of touch with america
5148439 when mccain came to town in sparks we had four days notice and he told everyone
5148440 i dont think obama is making himself accessible to the public
5148441 unable to close the deal either nationally or in nevada
5148442 knowingly trafficking in a counterfeit label affixed or designed to be affixed to
5148443 categorically a plea to an inherently fraudulent crime because the statute of convictions elements fit within the definition of inherently fraudulent conduct which is knowingly making false representations in order to gain something of value
5148444 first counterfeit labels are by definition false representations because they appear to be genuine but are not
5148445 im buying batteries bottled water candles anything we can get right now before it really really gets too bad
5148446 trying to buy supplies because they said there is going to be a storm coming up and we flood like crazy
5148447 t hen it happens and its too late and you go to the store and its already sold out
5148448 my mom taught me very well she taught me to do that prepare for stuff like this because ive been through many of them
5148449 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5148450 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5148451 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5148452 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5148453 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5148454 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5148455 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5148456 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5148457 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the czech republic to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5148458 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia so this russian warning is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play
5148459 what are the benefits of your breaking that window many you calm yourself down the enclosure gets lighter and cooler the poisons rise a little off the floor the intensity lessens and the people you are looking for have a little more time for you to find them
5148460 it is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows
5148461 i have the microphone and you dont so youll have to listen to every damn thing i have to say
5148462 voc vai ter que ensinar ao meu marido como fazer isso
5148463 the moral worth of a being should depend on the nature of the being and not on our attitude towards it
5148464 o caminh o levava aproximadamente 60 pessoas o ve culo virou quando atravessava uma ponte sobre o rio glace no sudoeste do haiti
5148465 n o temos o n mero exato de v timas mas a informa o que recebemos nos leva a crer que mais de 60 pessoas estavam no caminh o no momento do acidente
5148466 estou indo para o local do acidente para fazer um relat rio
5148467 you know hes got a lot longer track record than that
5148468 hes a legendary entrepreneur and you know one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5148469 i assured senator obama that this is a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems
5148470 it would be inappropriate for me to speak for senator obama i have a real sense however that he was very engaged he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing
5148471 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5148472 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come
5148473 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5148474 for them the hardliners the strategic aim of the invasion was not achieved so it was a defeat this creates problems in moscow
5148475 they may not be against subduing the georgians but the question is at what price
5148476 eating with her beak was like using one chopstick she also had trouble drinking and couldnt preen her feathers
5148477 the heritage of antiquity like nature itself is a vast space requiring interpretation in both cases there are signs to be discovered and then little by little made to speak
5148478 cualquier noci n de que rusia es un estado responsable y preparado para integrarse en las instituciones internacionales de mbito pol tico diplom tico econ mico y de seguridad ha cambiado ahora tenemos una rusia diferente
5148479 si rusia no cumple con el alto el fuego mi opini n es que rusia debe someterse a las consecuencias por sus acciones contra un estado soberano
5148480 la imagen de una rusia moderna y avanzada como la describi hace un mes el presidente dmitri medvedev est ahora echa unos gui apos eso ya supone una consecuencia directa para rusia
5148481 adem s explic rice los rusos no han hecho m s que estropear sus relaciones con otros vecinos como ucrania o polonia creo que mosc ha cometido un grave error

5148484 we have an impressive cloud infrastructure and our services can allow anyone to become more cloudy
5148485 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time
5148486 we are missing the best player in the world in tiger woods the pressure will be more on them for the first time europe is going to have everything to lose
5148487 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
5148488 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
5148489 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5148490 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5148491 in over 70 percent of the cities studied more than half of urban agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater that is either raw or diluted in streams
5148492 in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use diluted or untreated wastewater or polluted river water

5148497 prayer helps us to develop our proper spiritual stance frees us from reliance on purely human means and from doctrinal extremes and prepares us so that in humility and simplicity we may be open to receive that revelation which is only given to little ones luke 10 21
5148498 i knew i would have to get in the hunt early and knew when he got into position he would be strong getting home
5148499 it is a race that everybody wants to win theres no greater thrill
5148500 todays win might not have been as exciting as the earlier wins but it still was a great thrill
5148501 what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me
5148502 i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5148503 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good
5148504 even if we go in the house close the windows and turn up music its loud it never stops
5148505 we put up wooden panels to deaden the noise and covered some with carpet we moved our shotgun range to the other side of the camp we eliminated the black powder gun demonstrations because they were too loud
5148506 hey bob yeah im just cloudin with some clients be with you in a sec
5148507 we have an impressive cloud infrastructure and our services can allow anyone to become more cloudy
5148508 these are common ailments things theyd normally go to their doctor for
5148509 but this way we can handle them more quickly in about 40 minutes
5148510 it definitely decreases the amount of waiting time in the emergency department
5148511 they dont really help decrease volume much or shorten wait times
5148512 about 10 to 12 percent of patients will qualify to be seen in fast track many patients though are too sick to be seen there
5148513 if you see 100 people a day and 90 of them are very sick its going to take longer and most wont qualify for fast track
5148514 when you have patients like that coming in the wait time is really improved with the fast track
5148515 fast tracks have their place but it isnt going to help the problem much
5148516 higher inflation may result in further tightening by the rbi so further offloading in banks and rate sensitive sectors is likely the immediate resistance for nifty futures now is around 4470 4500 and above that 4540 and 4590 now remain major stumbling blocks in its upmove its immediate support is now around 4400 a failure to move above 4500 and a decisive breach of 4400 at this juncture will lend further momentum to the downswing at this juncture and it may then slide to 4360 and 4320 below that

5148533 you can make these up to one week in advance
5148534 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5148535 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5148536 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5148537 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5148538 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5148539 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5148540 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5148541 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5148542 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5148543 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5148544 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5148545 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5148546 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5148547 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5148548 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5148549 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5148550 im hoping my love of racism will offset my hate of musicals
5148551 theres momentary teen smoking i dont know if i can watch this
5148552 ohh john waters as a flasher that must have been tough
5148553 wait im watching two james marsden movies in one weekend what are we watching next superman returns
5148554 let me guess shes going to audition if she doesnt this is going to be a very short movie
5148555 this movie would be a lot better if the word crabs didnt come up
5148556 she does have the best lines i mean he i dont mean to alarm you but i might find john travolta sexy
5148557 wow look at how orange she is just like charlie crist
5148558 wait thats the guy from envy right and kangaroo jack
5148559 what the hell i think the booze is kicking in

5148563 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5148564 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5148565 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5148566 we will provide immediate relief to working people who have lost their jobs families who have lost their homes and people who have lost their way

5148579 you have it in your power to make your days on earth a path of flowers instead of a path of thorns
5148580 our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn that there is no end in nature but every end is a beginning and under every deep a lower deep opens
5148581 yes thats true and its no reason to make marijuana illegal and have to deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5148582 no marijuana doesnt cause lung cancer and heres the proof but even if it did cause lung cancer it still wouldnt be a reason to make marijuana illegal and deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5148583 i did a few races on the side but i wanted to build the team so im not a driver who wishes he did this or that
5148584 ive had a good career and raced all over the world including indy and le mans it was a good career i enjoyed it but this has been a different challenge and so far it has been a nice experience over the last 12 years
5148585 what i enjoyed about coming to the united states from europe is the approach of racing
5148586 people are much more positive and much nicer with a better atmosphere it really fit my character much better than in europe where people are very critical all the time and you get a lot of pressure when you are racing
5148587 this really fit my character very well when i came to the united states i really enjoyed the racing spirit in the united states much more than in europe
5148588 suddenly it came into my mind what if i start my own team my wife told me if i stopped driving she didnt want me to start a team and didnt want to live in indianapolis
5148589 six weeks later we were there my wife and my kids in indianapolis we started with nothing and that was in november of 1996 in march of 1997 i was at homestead with an indy lights team
5148590 at the end of the day it is good for the sport
5148591 the timing was quite off but this is what it is we have a lot to learn and it has been a steep learning curve for us we have to be realistic with this situation weve had our challenge and we still have our challenges but we have to look at the big picture if we are positive and constructive and communicate we will do well
5148592 we like indianapolis and i guess we are hoosiers now but we came here by choice
5148593 on the other hand im really big on keeping my culture as a team i always try to bring a mix of european and american flavor i always try to have a mix and bring the best from both sides
5148594 there is an international school in indianapolis and that was a very big part of being able to keep the culture for the kids and keep some ties for ourselves as well over the years we have a mix of european and american friends as far as european restaurants in indianapolis i dont know much of one
5148595 eric doesnt have another business this is how he makes his living and eric is quite an honest guy
5148596 he is at the shop every day and has meetings when there are rumors he has an open door policy and you can go in there and talk to him about anything plus he has been a racer himself if he complains about a driver you have to remind him that he was once like that too
5148597 eu recebi um telefonema perguntando se eu queria ganhar a elei o
5148598 todo processo eleitoral no pa s inteiro pode ser burlado
5148599 temos que pegar um n mero x de urnas eletr nicas reprogram las saber qual o tipo de flash card que vai ter nela qual a cor do disquete saber mais ou menos qual a quantidade de votos que tem naquela urna e colocar um n mero x de votos para o candidato que eu vou querer
5148600 a minha senha nem existe ainda minha assinatura digital nem foi colhida de maneira que ele n o tem essa senha nem nunca vai ter
5148601 n o tenho essa confirma o e n o dei essa confirma o para ningu m acho imposs vel fazer isso
5148602 em poucas horas ou mesmo em alguns meses ele n o conseguiria quebrar a senha criptografada precisaria de um parque computacional com uma capacidade extremamente grande pra quebrar a senha criptografada e ter acesso ao sistema ent o eu considero praticamente imposs vel a fraude em uma elei o
5148603 sempre tem aqueles aproveitadores de plant o que quando ocorre alguma coisa deste tipo eles tentam vender servi os que s o imposs veis de serem realizados
5148604 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5148605 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5148606 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5148607 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5148608 ive made up my mind dont need to think it over if im wrong i am right dont need to look no further this aint lust i know this is love but if i tell the world ill never say enough cos it was not said to you and thats exactly what i need to do if i end up with you should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements even if it leads no where or would it be a waste even if i knew my place should i leave it there should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements even if it leads nowhere i build myself up and fly around in circles waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle finally could this be it or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements even if it leads no where or would it be a waste even if i knew my place should i leave it there should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements even if it leads nowhere
5148609 while not all of the projects presented here offer practical or realizable solutions they ask the audience critically to examine their own habits their communitys environmental policies and in an election year the environmental policies of the presidential candidates simultaneously the exhibition seeks to inspire the audience to think about changes in their own lives and communities that would contribute toward a sustainable future in short the exhibition addresses issue of political currency a museum exhibition allows us to address these issues in a neutral space divorced from political partisanship we would like this exhibition to serve as such a forum for the communities of northeast oklahoma
5148610 this extraordinary opportunity to collaboration with dr merryday an expert in environmental and contemporary artwork and the university of tulsa provides a platform for discussion with students professors and the general public on up to the minute issues in the art world
5148611 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5148612 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5148613 if the thunderbirds didnt move i dont know that we would ever have stopped billeting
5148614 the bottom line is that if they cant play well itll make it hard to get to the next level
5148615 for some young guys it can definitely be a little tough to make the adjustment
5148616 they feel all the emotion that any teenagers do sometimes they need comforting words
5148617 he found out and just got in his car and had to leave
5148618 one time a girl called for a guy before he even moved into the house
5148619 on the one hand i believe everyone can really see that this is a great move for our team
5148620 but i know some billets have really become part of these guys daily lives i know there may be a little discomfort for everyone
5148621 its not over though its just a move forward for the team
5148622 i didnt jump on it it was just an old bed and it was going to break eventually
5148623 i have to tell you that there is some danger here
5148624 do people see him as too presumptuous sort of trying to look like a president
5148625 the one thing thats more powerful than hope and change is pity
5148626 fifty seven percent of the americans who voted in the presidential election voted against bill clinton
5148627 and i intend to represent that majority on the floor of the u s senate
5148628 the democrats will have both the white house and both houses of congress there cant be any more excuses for gridlock and bad legislation those excuses are over they now have the heavy burden of leadership and delivering on many of their promises and if they fail then they are the problem
5148629 somebody sends me a blue dress and some dna ill have an investigation
5148630 a veteran who volunteered for combat duty spent four months under fire in vietnam and then exaggerated a bit so he could go home early is the inferior morally and otherwise of a man who had his father pull strings so he wouldnt have to go to vietnam in the first place
5148631 the worst gap in achievement between poor and non poor children
5148632 an excuse to not meet the needs of connecticuts children of color
5148633 many banks are at the point of worrying what to do next
5148634 a lot of the assumptions have changed from overnight batch processing to enabling electronic transactions
5148635 new players have recognised this and are providing technology that works in real time and puts customers rather than financial products at the centre of transaction processing
5148636 batch processing systems were not meant for 90 percent of what banks do now
5148637 as a result other applications have been cluged on top of current systems to make it look like youre getting a real time account balance
5148638 big r amp d investments by infosys tata sap and oracle mean they now have mature platforms and so they are largely driving this new wave
5148639 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5148640 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5148641 you dont look old enough to have a credit card
5148642 will look and sound old and weak next to obama
5148643 a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5148644 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
5148645 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
5148646 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5148647 you know were going to end this youre answering so quickly you want to play a game of poker
5148648 my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana
5148649 now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue
5148650 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
5148651 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5148652 cast one of the highest percentage votes against president reagan of any member of congress when he was there
5148653 tom ridge is the personification of the status quo in government
5148654 in that sense he isnt even a mccain who at least can claim he has made serious efforts at reform ridge comes back in here from time to time and supports his establishment status quo cronies he is not even close to being a conservative reformer
5148655 hes the guy that was responsible for setting up fema before katrina hit you dont think the democrats have that one all researched
5148656 he could but mccain can carry pennsylvania without him and what does his presence say to conservatives in other states like ohio
5148657 is that it will be a wash those who vote for mccain because of ridge will be canceled out by those who refuse to vote or vote for libertarian nominee bob barr
5148658 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5148659 it was just a man to man coverage and jon put it in a perfect spot
5148660 there was a little contact jons putting it in the right places and were running our routes in the right places
5148661 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5148662 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5148663 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5148664 there has been very weak support from conservatives for romney for months now but faced with the prospect of a pro choice vice president romneys numbers improved
5148665 it isnt what she wanted or the democrats in general wanted and now we have a couple of issues that weve allowed to take over the debate
5148666 were doing polling and other research to figure what our options may be
5148667 soko wunderbar sch chtern wirkende stimme charmanter franz sischer akzent und einfache musik
5148668 why do you need to enrich uranium if you dont have the facilities that can make use of this uranium for civilian purposes
5148669 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations
5148670 we see no reason to change our opinion that an israeli or western air strike is the only realistic way to prevent these two experts on energy and geopolitics estimate that 55
5148671 i come to you as a citizen of the world
5148672 im going to be finished fencing today and this is the best ending i could ever dream of ever since i was a little kid ive always dreamed of an olympic medal
5148673 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5148674 this basically hurt him as a human being for like a year and a half or so and he thought he was going to quit fencing he looked at himself as a failure because of that
5148675 he was able to slay the dragon of athens and that was the most important thing it was so important for keeth smart to recover from the devastation that he faced four years ago
5148676 watching my sister win a medal and coming back the next day to win a medal myself its exhilarating
5148677 theres not that many olympians from new york city so were proud to bring these medals home
5148678 the problem is hes sticking with this pattern despite the fiscal problem
5148679 on the one hand he is saying we cant do business as usual on the other hand this is straight business as usual
5148680 this is not an irresponsible robust contract that we are giving to a union these are increases that are in line with a pattern of bargaining that were done with other unions
5148681 georgia is a sovereign state that deserves to be in nato
5148682 then i think we would have to start thinking of something else
5148683 if youre in the middle of a building fa ade you have a lot of building around you if youre on a spire you have nothing around you except air
5148684 we have to get permits to do this kind of work in new york city and we dont anywhere else
5148685 being in the shadows of those buildings in the months before september 11 and then suddenly theyre gone it was horrifying
5148686 there is a feature of current law that especially for high income people some people get marriage bonuses some people get marriage penalties those same people would continue to get those bonuses or penalties under both the mccain plan or the obama plan the obama plan doesnt add any new people
5148687 what is important though is to look at the overall agenda that these two candidates have for working women and what they would do
5148688 your editorial today accusing barack obama of creating a new marriage penalty in his tax plan and declaring a war on women was an outrageous distortion
5148689 the truth is that under obamas tax plan not a single new couple would get a marriage penalty because they have high incomes not one
5148690 there were twenty two women of whom three are working full time at this point
5148691 the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would harm the economy is supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history
5148692 pido que despu s de que las fuerzas armadas dejen el territorio georgiano comiencen las negociaciones y una mayor b squeda de soluciones para no sembrar la discordia entre nuestros pa ses
5148693 no vamos a sembrar discordia para las futuras generaciones no pido su misericordia sino que apelo a su pragmatismo creo que ha llegado el momento de tomar las decisiones correctas
5148694 este punto es desde mi punto de vista innegociable debe afectar a todas las fuerzas de combate rusas que ingresaron a georgia a partir del 7 de agosto si esta cl usula del alto el fuego no se aplica de forma r pida y completa me ver a impulsado a llamar un consejo europeo extraordinario para decidir acerca de las consecuencias
5148695 tambi n debemos decidir si la intervenci n de rusia contra su vecino georgiano en este caso puntual fue una respuesta brutal y excesiva lo que tendr a inevitablemente consecuencias para las relaciones con la uni n europea

5148698 im really happy to win my first stage race said keller
5148699 it was a really nice race and i found out what it feels like to be a gc rider i didnt have to do anything after i got the yellow jersey except eat and drink my team mates did everything else
5148700 the girls rode really well together and came up with a very exciting victory
5148701 it was also very rewarding for me as this is my first tour win as a director in womens cycling
5148702 si bugoy siya na po ang sasagot doon kasi i cannot say anything for him i didnt know him while i was growing up yung kay hansen he also has to say something about that for himself im close with van but not with the other two
5148703 kung sinuman ang nagsasabing bading siya doesnt really know him weve been on for three years and ive seen anything in him that would make me suspect na gay siya matagal din niya akong niligawan and id say our relationship is an open one both romantic and platonic were here to support each other and we both have dreams to pursue in life na siyang mas priority namin and contrary to what some people think we didnt break up kami pa rin kahit were far apart now
5148704 problems that have caused a complete breakdown or malfunction of any component function or item i
5148705 i thought it was a really good scrimmage for us they had a nice set of receivers and a good quarterback
5148706 they ran that quick passing game well in a scrimmage you dont always know what routes they are going to run but we know we need work on our pass defense thats what scrimmages are for
5148707 we struggled with our passing game i think we just had a little too much adrenaline going
5148708 we ran the ball well we also stopped their running game cold they scored their two touchdowns on a couple of passes
5148709 we know what we need to concentrate on for this week so that makes this scrimmage even better for us we also came out of it pretty healthy
5148710 bubba shivley was cleared to play today so he was on defense and got a few reps on offense we also had a couple of others getting a few reps
5148711 senior ryan kortokrax backup guard center and linebacker isnt ready to go yet and senior adam wollenhaupt is slowed by a hamstring injury the only one out is backup center cade bevington broken ankle lost for the season
5148712 by looking at the map it can be seen that if this line was extended north just a few miles it would reach defiance this would connect it with the b amp o into chicago and the wabash into toledo it may be that the owner had this thought in view
5148713 i hate to tell you this old man but i put one over on you when the train went through your ranch the engineer was asleep i could not have won
5148714 well i was worried about winning the case myself until that darned bull came home this morning
5148715 how ridiculous what an utterly useless defense mechanism even if it scares your opponent youre just injuring yourself
5148716 from what i saw on the sidelines i feel we accomplished that we were better today than the day before when we watch films well know more but based on what my eyes saw tonight we got it done
5148717 we had a chance to get some goal line looks and scored a couple of touchdowns we controlled the line of scrimmage on those plays our defense bent but didnt break we got a turnover on one of the series
5148718 i am very pleased with the passing game our line had great pass protection if you let wes sit back there hes going to find receivers
5148719 that will be key in keeping defenses from being able to sit in the box and concentrate only on the running game i felt adam warnecke had a breakout night making some nice catches we had some guys go deep some go intermediate and some short a good mix
5148720 i was pleased with how physical we played thats always good to see i was a little disappointed with our defense not getting off the field in a couple of third and longs but those are correctable
5148721 we may have gotten a little tired too but thats also something we can address we have some things to work on but can go forward now its also good that we came out of the scrimmage healthy in certain spots we have little depth right now
5148722 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5148723 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5148724 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5148725 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5148726 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5148727 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5148728 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5148729 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5148730 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5148731 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5148732 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5148733 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5148734 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5148735 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5148736 how it plays out will have a big impact on his re election bid
5148737 i think hes down to earth i think hes just more in touch with the people
5148738 hes more like one of us i would say than some of the other governors weve had
5148739 im open to anybody but since he first took office nothing seems to have gone right
5148740 the unaffiliated voters in this state tell the true story of the colorado electorate
5148741 my life is pretty much packed into my racquet bag
5148742 what we saw across the league is fan behavior becoming more and more of an issue obviously it starts in the mornings out in the tailgate areas and it comes on into the stadium what we want to make sure is everybody understands is enjoy yourself but enjoy yourself responsibly
5148743 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5148744 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5148745 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5148746 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5148747 yall do i have to do the splits im a christian
5148748 there is no difference in law between war and peace
5148749 had thought a great deal about the potential of the vice presidency carter talked at length about how he saw the office as a wasted national asset he was determined to use his vice presidency in a way no president had done previously
5148750 made it clear to carter that he did not want to be considered if it was to be a strictly ceremonial office he was only interested in a truly substantive role
5148751 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
5148752 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
5148753 we get the support from the community were going to get our man
5148754 i cannot image what would drive somebody to do that
5148755 every now and then something will come up that just takes us aback that weve not seen or heard of or wouldnt ever think of happening this is such as case
5148756 very strong very determined i dont know what id do in his position im proud of him i can tell you that im proud of him
5148757 hes well seasoned a stand up guy with lots of experience age is absolutely not a factor
5148758 a lot of us older people have good minds and good bodies i think when you get older you have more common sense and use better judgment
5148759 he has a lot of experience where his opponent has little and never served in the military
5148760 its a simple script and nothing revolutionary or life changing about a story about life changes and it doesnt sustain the momentum that the opening song
5148761 if you liked steves award winning story you should also like deborahs nominated one
5148762 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5148763 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life

5148788 how ive see him roberts operate since he went to the bench confirms the suspicions that i had and the reasons i voted against him
5148789 one of the most important jobs of i believe of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches and i think he has been a little bit too willing and eager to give the administration whether its mine or george bushs more power than the constitution intended
5148790 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers
5148791 i love germany and i love the n rburgring it was here in 2007 that we picked up our first one two of the season and weve gone and done the same again this time round todays result is a fantastic reward for the whole team theyre all delighted after finishing second and third at le mans it was important for peugeot to win this weekend and take the lead in both the manufacturers and drivers championships the title will finally be decided at silverstone we preferred to let our crews fight it out between themselves here because it was too early to start thinking in terms of strategy for the drivers title we took our decision out of respect for our drivers who all put in great performances again despite the traffic as well as for sporting reasons we didnt want to influence the outcome this is a great result not only for our brand but also for the psa group which scored two one two finishes in germany today with citro n taking first and second in the countrys round of the wrc
5148792 our race plan went perfectly we stayed with our incisive strategy of starting strongly in order to pull out a gap and we lapped our closest rivals at the halfway point so as not to lose the benefit of our hard work should the safety car come out the aerodynamic set up of the 2008 sprint spec 908 proved very competitive
5148793 i am proud of our performance for peugeot today it was very important to get both cars to the finish with a view to scoring championship points and after junes le mans 24 hours it was also important for st phane and me to get back onto the podium theres nothing like winning i am really delighted with this result because there were no team orders which goes to show what a sporting team peugeot is
5148794 its a fantastic result for us and for the whole team our car was perfectly balanced and the mechanics did a terrific job which enabled us to claim our second win of year following our victory at monza we had a good fight with the n 7 car and there was never much in it so nobody could afford to make a mistake
5148795 we lost a lot of time in the traffic especially behind the lola aston martin that cost us the lead and we then dropped a further 30 seconds to the n 8 car when we had a small problem with the starter probably because of a loose connection in the button
5148796 todays result is very positive for us in terms of the drivers championship it was nice to start from pole position and we also posted the fastest race lap the title decision will now go down to the wire at silverstone which is a circuit i love

5148823 by educating our customers on what it means to have diabetes
5148824 the time is now we need to come to get to create awareness and to educate everyone
5148825 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion
5148826 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5148827 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5148828 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5148829 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5148830 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5148831 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5148843 im a big believer in cooperation with other counties we can expand our efforts that way
5148844 this will give us the ability to be a little more self sufficient as for us serving our own community hopefully the commissioners will see there is value to all of this
5148845 weve got a very agricultural community the farmers are still out there and they still need support
5148846 i asked you what two plus two equals and a day later you tell me not twenty five
5148847 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect

5148855 this was a great test to see how mentally strong we really are
5148856 charlotte brought their a game they played well they executed their offense they were running out on us once we got into it we didnt look back this is pretty remarkable i will always remember this i am definitely cherishing this moment
5148857 weve got a good streak going here but you cant get too high or two low
5148858 after tonight you enjoy it and then you come back in tomorrow have a shootaround and focus on the los angeles lakers
5148859 we were determined to come in here and try to end the streak
5148860 we thought we might be able to sneak up but they are a very aggressive team and picked it up in the second half when you win 21 games in a row its not about one person its about an entire team tracy is carrying the load and leading the team and should be in consideration for the mvp award
5148861 mcgrady didnt leave me one time all game they are a very smart defensive team
5148862 i could tell right off the bat energy wise we werent our normal selves
5148863 last couple of games we were kind of spoiled off the fact that we came out with really good energy and for some reason tonight we just didnt against a team like utah we just couldnt get oiled up and ready to go from the jump
5148864 they were the last team to beat us at home and we only have three losses at home and they were one of the teams so we definitely wanted to avenge that it was just a great team victory everyone played well everyone stepped up defensively and offensively
5148865 i thought early in the game you have a 50 50 chance to get to every loose ball and it was about 98 2 in percentage in utahs favor they played harder more aggressive they were more physical and tougher and they beat us it doesnt happen often but it happened

5148904 they were aggressive and started running i thought we came out slow and that is usually not like us to come out and have a slow third quarter we came out and didnt have that spunk
5148905 i think you can see we can play both ways
5148906 that is what we have to do is to be able to change gears with guys like boris diaw and l b leandro barbosa they will speed us up and when we need to go big we will go big

5148957 this is very challenging and is based on a high level of taxonomic know how
5148958 first you catch a female moth by net second you catch a male moth using either natural female pheromones or artificial pheromones as a lure the female moth mates with the male and produces eggs after a few days larvae hatch then the larvae are infected by parasitic wasps this is where taxonomic knowledge is crucial you need to infect the larvae with exactly the correct kind of parasite
5148959 the larval stage takes one month after which a larva pupates and makes a cocoon
5148960 the pupal stage takes another month and if the larva has been successfully infected if the female wasp laid her eggs there only parasites will emerge from the cocoon the parasites then attack and kill the larvae youre trying to get rid of
5148961 they built about twenty huge buildings in and around beijing
5148962 inside each lab are many rearing rooms and thousands of larvae are feeding in each room simultaneously parasites are released into the rooms to lay their eggs in the larvae

5148990 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5148991 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5148992 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5148993 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view

5149003 il web non semplicemente una sostituzione del broadcast non si tratta di un opuscolo politico pi economico e interattivo e una tecnologia che se ben architettata
5149004 vorrei che vicino lontano e calendidonna fossero potenziati per ottenere una visibilit sempre pi ampia magari coinvolgendo nomi importanti della cultura e suscitando linteresse dei media poi sono una donna e quindi sono molto sensibile ad iniziative come calendidonna che accendono i riflettori sulluniverso femminile il far east film festival andrebbe a mio avviso un po ripensato perch a dieci anni dalla prima edizione molto cambiato nei rapporti tra europa ed estremo oriente dieci anni fa insomma avrebbe fatto certamente pi scalpore friuli doc per me un discorso a parte lo vedo come una grande festa popolare che ha il merito di coinvolgere moltissime persone penso che si dovrebbe lavorare per migliorare per quanto possibile tutti quei servizi che la citt pu e deve offrire per condizionare positivamente la riuscita della festa mi riferisco in particolar modo ai servizi igienici alla gestione del traffico e dei parcheggi etc non entro invece in merito alla maratonina che un evento che ho sempre vissuto dal di fuori e concludo dicendo che innovaction uniniziativa da sostenere perch come una piccola pianta che deve essere coltivata ma che nel tempo produrr certamente dei frutti
5149005 personalmente credo di s ma considerando la straordinaria affluenza devo riconoscere che la formula finora adottata funziona mi sembra che la gente non si aspetti altro da friuli doc
5149006 vorrei valorizzare maggiormente feste tradizionali come il carnevale mettendo insieme gioco scherzi e richiami alla storia della nostra citt anche il natale andrebbe preparato con pi cura studiando una bella illuminazione un delizioso mercatino in pazza libert o in piazza san giacomo
5149007 s perch no mi rendo conto che piazza primo maggio morta non funziona ma a dire il vero era cos anche venti o trentanni fa un duro colpo per la piazza fu quando il comune fece sloggiare le giostre che venivano per la festa santa caterina quella volta ne venivano molte di pi di quelle che ci sono ora in primavera e ricordo che per qualche settimana allanno la piazza era veramente attraente particolarmente per noi ragazzi
5149008 per quanto riguarda gli orari penso che si deva considerare i diritti dei residenti e quindi cercare una ragionevole mediazione con questi ultimi aprire una discoteca in centro invece mi sembra difficile perch le discoteche aprono a notte fonda e chiudono allalba tanti anni fa cera una piccola discoteca in cui mi sono divertita tantissimo sotto il contarena ma apriva il sabato pomeriggio
5149009 e una buona opportunit per udine ma non vorrei che ne uscisse un altro centro sociale non ho niente contro i centri sociali sia chiaro solo che penso che essi siano spazi esclusivi mentre il comune deve puntare al massimo coinvolgimento dei giovani e dei meno giovani
5149010 i giovani che conosco e ne conosco e frequento veramente tanti inviano in media 100 sms al giorno e vanno matti per dragonball e il dr house per coinvolgerli bisognerebbe sintonizzarsi sulle loro lunghezze donda magari che so dandogli la possibilit di interagire tra loro e con il comune per mezzo di un nuova e stimolante sezione del sito comune udine it
5149011 centro chiuso s certamente la gente per vuole la chiusura completa e un piano di restyling urbanistico che comprenda degli splendidi arredi urbani i politici quindi devono esaudire nel migliore dei modi questa richiesta
5149012 le targhe alterne sono un palliativo non risolvono il problema
5149013 but im here to take a look and see what theyve got
5149014 we were very fast on defense looked like we were confident and knew what we were doing on offense we did not look the same way
5149015 is our offense as bad as it looked or is our defense as good as it looked i suspect from having done this for many years the answer is somewhere in between
5149016 but i did feel our defense would be the best weve had and so far ive seen nothing that i would back away from that statement on
5149017 and i thought i was going to be very very pleased with it

5149042 it was a surprise judging from where they insurgents were when we entered
5149043 it looked like they thought wed come across the river at its narrowest point instead we came from behind and above it was a classic case of counter insurgency
5149044 we had a clean battlefield to work with since reconnaissance showed that the entire civilian population was gone moved out into the desert weeks before when they heard we were coming that freed us up for doing the job quickly and in the way we work best

5149070 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5149071 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5149072 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense

5149075 servicios de salud del estado de puebla ssep reconoci que podr a existir negligencia en la p rdida de 52 toneladas de medicamentos y material de curaci n caducos en los almacenes de la dependencia por lo que la contralor a estatal ya investiga el caso para sancionar a los responsables de esta irregularidad
5149076 as lo inform el coordinador de servicios de salud ricardo villa issa quien sostuvo que esta inconsistencia surge debido a que sus antecesores no implementaron controles adecuados en los almacenes
5149077 la mayor a de los productos caducaron entre 2002 y 2007 periodo que comprende las administraciones de melquiades morales flores y mario mar n torres de acuerdo con el inventario de medicamentos y materiales de curaci n para baja elaborado por las autoridades que llegaron a ssep en agosto pasado

5149090 im not any happier with this war than with that one im a change person we need something different
5149091 this is a nice looking little place but i think a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck
5149092 id like to get back to being a decent nation thats respected around the world
5149093 obamas trip was a little rah rah for me even but it shows he can connect with a lot of people and we need connecting
5149094 i know obama supports the troops too but hes not as much of a military supporter
5149095 i agree with a lot of the reasons we went into iraq but not all of them being there and seeing the people makes me think we should be there and help get them to a better place
5149096 i dont think whoever is elected will really change the economy
5149097 this gentleman doesnt understand it is not his to trade
5149098 i dont want to share what i will be talking about
5149099 i dont have it laid out in a concise way to share with you
5149100 we should be a nation of laws under the constitution we should have the rule of law not the rule of man
5149101 i dont know if anybody is going to be listening
5149102 all i know is they offered this free speech thing and i thought i would try
5149103 we will probably have an ecumenical church service and also have an advocate for the sanctity of life
5149104 just what its like to live in poverty and how we juggle things
5149105 the main point i want to make is that our government is not run constitutionally anymore
5149106 most people walk in look at the tank and say thats a cute turtle
5149107 its very similar to conjoined twins some kind of mutation takes place during the development process
5149108 last week the small agency in l a formed by ex tbwa chiat people called omelet la has laid off around 17 people they were working on activision account and they kept on delivering extremely buggy and crappy sites hence activision got pissed and took their million dollar account elsewhere omelet loses accounts nearly as fast as they win accounts average lifespan of accounts is around 2 months at omelet

5149118 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5149119 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5149120 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5149121 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5149122 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5149123 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5149124 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5149125 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5149126 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that

5149146 due to frequent tides we can beach the ship just two hundred yards metres from the coast
5149147 it saves us thousands of dollars for every ship we break whereas in alang and china they beach ships two or three kilometres out into the sea
5149148 were handling ships as big as 80 000 tonnes these days
5149149 the rods made from scrap ships are inferior to those made by top steel producers but theyre at least 20 percent cheaper than high grade steel and therefore are overwhelmingly used in the countrys construction industry
5149150 back then we were paying 430 dollars a tonne about three months ago it was about 940 dollars a tonne but in may india introduced a 15 percent export tax and the price is now around 1 150 to 1 200 dollars
5149151 in the global context of rising costs every penny counts right now
5149152 its a very hazardous job our question is is the amount of steel supplied really enough compensation for the damage the industry is doing to workers and the environment
5149153 the ships are being recycled so we are helping the environment
5149154 we dont dump anything into the sea because everything is worth money so we sell it even the old oil
5149155 its really hard people are eating whatever they can find

5149161 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe

5149247 approximately 90 percent of our vegetables fruits grains and other food is produced with chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides because this information is generally suppressed from the public most consumers arent informed enough about the issues to care of course corporate executives care their widely held assumption is that using synthetic chemicals produces greater yields and therefore greater profits they mistakenly believe that using pesticides means less crop loss from insects and other animal pests and fungus and that chemical fertilizers increase crop size and volume a five year research project that studied midwestern farms concluded that in dollars per acre income between organic and conventional farms was the same although the cost of chemical fertilizer was the equalizing factor thus the contention that organic farming is more expensive and therefore less profitable is speculative at best and remains open to debate beyond profit and yield there is a looming price to pay for chemical based farming in terms of human and environmental health the cost to our precious earth includes the pollution of our air and waterways the depletion of topsoil arable land and natural habitat and the decimation of countless plant and animal species dollar for dollar the equation makes no sense unquestionably chemical inputs cause extensive damage to our environment but the inverse is equally astounding organic growing methods decrease pesticide contamination enrich the soil protect wildlife safeguard water resources are economically sound and health supporting and encourage a self sustaining ecosystem

5149253 the fact is that although we have a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5149254 politicians from hillary clinton and john kerry to howard dean have recently contended that abortions have increased since george w bush took office in 2001
5149255 this claim is false its based on an opinion piece that used data from only 16 states a study by the alan guttmacher institute of 43 states found that abortions have actually decreased

5149261 over a period of weeks we were able to create an application that worked very well on android
5149262 for instance a member could elect to spend 14 nights 1 190 points in a cliff side cottage with the family to escape the winter chill seven nights 280 points in a similar cottage in summer while the kids are on vacation and four nights 30 points in a cabana in the fall for a romantic getaway
5149263 when government is required to be more open and accountable it benefits everyone
5149264 it helps restore the peoples confidence in the public process
5149265 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro
5149266 both coking coal and thermal coal are in short supply in china
5149267 the situation this year has become the most severe in history
5149268 love what you do and become and expert in it
5149269 a perfect storm would be if this got out of control the economic backlash
5149270 other countries would get inroads into our markets and it would be hard to recover from it
5149271 its moving out towards the orchards and getting closer to those and thats when we could get into a real problem with the export its not even just export that guy cant even sell his fruit its not even good for making apple sauce
5149272 all of the sudden the warehouse comes and tells you we can no longer take your fruit and youre sitting there going well crop insurance doesnt cover this
5149273 basically its an empty feeling you might as well have been hit by frost or weather problems because its just going to destroy your crop
5149274 thats 90 every two weeks to spray these for the rest of the season
5149275 can you see the homeowner doing that all summer long every two weeks putting out 180 a month to take care of their ornamental trees it just doesnt happen

5149278 gentleman to share and relate with my choices in life both past and present
5149279 so sorry monsieur we are featuring frog arms only tonight
5149280 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5149281 we teach numbers then algebra then calculus then physics wrong
5149282 start with engineering and from that abstract out physics and from that abstract out ideas of calculus and eventually separate off pure mathematics so much better to have the first grade kid or kindergarten kid doing engineering and leave it to the older ones to do pure mathematics than to do it the other way around
5149283 everybody is motivated by challenge and solving problems and we dont make use of that in schools enough
5149284 project based learning gives everybody a chance to sort of mimic what scientists do and thats exciting and its fun if its done well
5149285 one of the major advantages of project work is that it makes school more like real life
5149286 in real life we dont spend several hours at a time listening to authorities who know more than we do and who tell us exactly what to do and how to do it
5149287 we need to be able to ask questions of a person were learning from we need to be able to link what the person is telling us with what we already know and we need to be able to bring what we already know and experiences weve had that are relevant to the topic to the front of our minds and say something about them
5149288 younger children will play and explore as well as engage in projects
5149289 older childrens project work will complement the systematic instruction in the program
5149290 in depth investigation of a real world topic worthy of childrens attention and effort
5149291 when we sit down to dinner the kids talk nonstop for twenty minutes telling us what they did and what they saw this is literally every day
5149292 ive seen test scores of students rise because of the engagement in project based learning
5149293 i saw my students mainstream out of english as a second language into the mainstream classroom i saw my mainstream students scoring three and four grades above their grade level on standardized tests im a convert
5149294 and that fundamentally was the final piece that shifted my thinking to the point where i realized i cant go back to the classroom and do things the same way i always have
5149295 it started not as this beautiful pure product of the abstract mind it started as a way of controlling the water of the nile building the pyramids sailing a ship and gradually it got richer and richer
5149296 what do we need to know to better understand the problem and then solve it
5149297 how much money do we have to spend on the redesign
5149298 no child should be in a moving vehicle without a seat belt
5149299 with or without seat belts the safest place for a kid to be is on the school bus
5149300 sadly the flat stanley project may be forced to end
5149301 i used flat stanley as a part of my national board certification process this project is an innovative and fun way to teach social studies along with reading my students begged me to read the other flat stanley books to them it is rare that you have kids wanting to listen to or read a story rather than go to pe or even lunch
5149302 this project gave the students the opportunity to actively learn about different cultures and countries therefore it would be a terrible loss for our school and students if the flat stanley project were to be terminated i sincerely hope that a solution can be found and that the project can go on for many years to come
5149303 the estate recently told me that it would take flatstanley com from me by legal means if necessary and then allow me to continue my project
5149304 it would be nice to come to an agreement so that these two properties could coexist to the mutual benefit of each
5149305 as a third grade teacher i dont have the resources for a legal battle maybe there are better ways to use my time
5149306 as many advantages as flat stanley provides he happens to be a little white male character
5149307 with the flat family we could have people of color females extended family grandparents even pets
5149308 ive seen thousands of teachers take the idea and run with it
5149309 theyre inspired by the concept and then they individualize it for their own students needs
5149310 these girls are writing about flat stanley getting involved in romances and having his heart broken
5149311 its an outlet for talking about their emotions and the feelings that come with growing up
5149312 with a traditional pen pal project it can be hard for some students to know what to say
5149313 but when youve got flat stanley its as if you have a mutual friend you have this third person that both parties can relate to and suddenly it opens the door to imagination and communication
5149314 imagine some very sick kids sending out a flat person
5149315 and traveling to places they may never be able to get to in real life
5149316 flat stanley for world peace its not too far off
5149317 when kids are fighting we elementary teachers always try to find a win win situation
5149318 im still hoping to find a way that allows everybody to get along
5149319 the flat stanley project can be a gateway to new technologies
5149320 if my flat stanley can make it to the prime ministers office
5149321 many of these students wouldnt have access to these classes otherwise
5149322 those courses expanded my field of study and my knowledge in areas that my small high school couldnt
5149323 there was no way i would have been able to start as a sophomore in my computer science study at carnegie mellon without those classes
5149324 pool teaching resources and increase course offerings to high schools
5149325 the states have to take this on in order for it to be a success
5149326 floridas program was state sponsored while north carolina has not as yet funded a virtual school
5149327 my online teachers make me feel like theyre my private tutor
5149328 when you turn in an assignment the teacher will email you a response telling you what you did wrong and what you can do to fix it
5149329 from that email you can click on the assignment go back into it and take their advice
5149330 i know my online students better than my classroom students
5149331 we discuss themes and characters and in those discussions students often tell me personal anecdotes they are comfortable online and confide in me more than they would a teacher that they see every day
5149332 we have identified gifted students online that were not identified in the classroom
5149333 many students respond to this learning environment in a way they dont in a classroom
5149334 people dont know you as the kid down the street when youre online
5149335 in class if you say you support the right to an abortion your parents might hear about that online it doesnt matter
5149336 he said i never realized how many of my students questions i never answered until i taught online
5149337 it allows our students to interact and take classes with kids in the u s and all over the world
5149338 it also gives students in the u s a larger worldview
5149339 a student in the florida panhandle and one in miami might as well be in different time zones
5149340 over the past year when ive been talking with people about the problems in schools the answer is always distance learning
5149341 ive worked in poor communities in the south that have crumbling facilities and difficulty recruiting teachers and principals online learning is not a solution to facilities that are falling down and it doesnt solve underfunding
5149342 students must be willing to take responsibility for their own learning
5149343 unless the student is a bit of a risk taker they struggle here
5149344 i think thats because the traditional system does not place responsibility on the student
5149345 but if we start applying the same kind of rigor and evaluation to online high school courses that we apply to curriculum in brick and mortar schools
5149346 zoe can work on a class at 10 p m if thats when we come home from a competition
5149347 schools play a tremendous role in socialization and in the community
5149348 it was almost as if i was a brand new teacher again
5149349 the transition was more difficult than i ever imagined it probably took six months until i felt comfortable
5149350 theres this persistent opinion that people who have never taught in this medium can jump in and teach a class
5149351 a good classroom teacher is not necessarily a good online teacher
5149352 youre always available for the students and they know they can email you anytime and youre going to respond
5149353 their class day with you doesnt end at 3 30 like it does with a normal class they can go home and any time at night they can email you about personal problems or school problems
5149354 the biggest struggle is to arrange a schedule because now youre open to this great flexibility that youve never had before
5149355 leave me alone i dont feel like thinking about this
5149356 ok is that environmentally controlled is it something we can instill in others
5149357 i can learn to control the physiological state of my learners much more by using music at the right time
5149358 i heard of this site while watching the news i put my zip code in and was surprised to see an offender that seems to work at the shops at atlas park with all the kids that go there i cant see people would be very happy about this i realize people need to work but arent they supposed to not work where there are a lot of kids
5149359 all this unnecessary parking could completely erase the citys positive efforts to reduce congestion
5149360 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5149361 i come here tonight with a cure for a broken heart as well
5149362 im preaching to me as much as im preaching to you tonight
5149363 the faith he has and his strength is simply amazing to me
5149364 the younger generation needs that hope of eternity and pastor laurie has given it to them heaven is dearer to pastor laurie now because he has a loved one there
5149365 as long as they keep coming well be coming back to anaheim
5149366 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5149367 i am not what i ought to be i am not what i want to be i am not what i hope to be but still i am not what i used to be and by the grace of god i am what i am
5149368 its better to be hated for who you are then to be loved for who you are not
5149369 i dont know what the key to success is but the key to failure is trying to please everybody
5149370 a womans heart should be so close to god that a man has to seek god to find it
5149371 i gather up each sound you left behind and stretch them on our bed each night i breathe you and become high
5149372 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die tomorrow
5149373 when you educate a man you educate an individual but when you educate a woman you educate a nation
5149374 any writer i suppose feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent
5149375 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
5149376 simon son of john do you truly love me more than these
5149377 lord you know all things you know that i love you
5149378 feed my sheep i tell you the truth when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go
5149379 years could pass by and id think i smelled it even if i didnt
5149380 where people are tentative anyway that just puts them over the edge
5149381 it should smell clean and fresh but shouldnt be cloying
5149382 if you cook and entertain a lot it makes a big difference
5149383 truth brings with it great responsibilities that is why so many men keep their hands open to welcome it but never close them to grasp it in their cowardice they keep their minds open so they will never have to close on anything that would entail responsibility duty moral correction or altered behavior
5149384 start at the bottom and work your way up the list
5149385 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue
5149386 we need this group of californians to contribute to the economy
5149387 this budget runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy
5149388 it is time for democrats to take their heads out of the sand
5149389 continues to push legislators to pass a bipartisan budget that he can sign
5149390 what we get instead of real reform is phony reform pushed by our democratic friends
5149391 will do nothing to help us live within our means
5149392 you know ive been asked that question for 26 years and i still dont have an answer
5149393 all i can say is that its a great family half hour so the whole family can sit around and play together and watch together and theres so much negativity on television these days its a nice half hour of family fun
5149394 i say that in jest i think its because it has been the two of us for the past 26 years people are familiar with us theyre comfortable with us so i think they would find it unusual to have somebody else in our place you know its just a comfort zone
5149395 i dont know if thats a rumour or if its true
5149396 so hopefully well have a job for a few more years and from there im not sure
5149397 we dont tape every day which is great it gives me the chance to be a mom at home for my two kids
5149398 being a full time mom when im not taping has pretty much filled my schedule and i love it
5149399 its my favourite job of all being a mom and my children are growing so fast i dont want to miss anything i know theyre going to be off to college before i know it so i really want to spend all the time i can with them
5149400 but every once in a while when i turn the tv on it will be on the channel and i will catch it now and again just to see what it looks like its the same with my kids they dont really watch it either well be flipping channels and theyll go oh there you are mom but thats normal to them for me to be on tv

5149404 if youre a larger company theres high probability you have creative people in your organization but creative people get impatient
5149405 every time you introduce managerial hierarchy you introduce barriers to collaboration and collaboration is key
5149406 innovation is about the ecosystem either removing barriers internally or allowing third parties to help meet the needs of your customers in ways you cant afford to do or have the time to do
5149407 all of the innovative people dont work for your company
5149408 if you have an interesting idea and dont want to go the vc route we provide seed funding
5149409 we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities
5149410 this is a problem that has to be dealt with whether or not there is a peace process
5149411 i just got my airave on tuesday and so far i am absolutely loving this thing all in all i give it a 5 out of 5 the only thing i cannot access is anything that uses the mobile broadband network
5149412 i was able to place a call inside and walk 4 houses down the street before my phone defaulted back to the regular network this i think is pretty impressive every test call i have made and received has worked 100 and my texts seems to be coming through just fine so far a very good first day with the airave
5149413 at the current time the airave blocks all virgin mobile phones in its range and they cannot complete or receive any calls whatsoever
5149414 life is dull short full of pain why not enjoy it while you can

5149421 cal has been a really solid program the past few years
5149422 the academics there are always the best and thats a factor too its close to home and thats always a plus my parents want me to stay close but they know its my decision they said that its up to me and im not going to choose a school just because they are close
5149423 im weighing everything and will take some time before i decide
5149424 cal has been a really solid program the past few years
5149425 the academics there are always the best and thats a factor too its close to home and thats always a plus my parents want me to stay close but they know its my decision they said that its up to me and im not going to choose a school just because they are close

5149428 im gonna go on my mission but im going to wait
5149429 it was very hot but the camp went well i liked the coaches i met and they were very intense the linebacker coach craig bray arizona state seemed like the kind of guy who could definitely take you to the next level
5149430 i know they havent done too good recently but they have good coaches and its supposed to be a really nice environment
5149431 i also think colorado is an up and coming program and i might be able to play early there
5149432 i fill the holes with power and add a lot of hype to the game i never stop
5149433 i want to work more on my pass coverage and of course continue getting stronger and faster

5149436 but im not just thinking of us families with children the older people need the pool for hydrotherapy an indoor pool is important for the future health and wellbeing of our children and our community

5149461 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5149462 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5149463 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5149464 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5149465 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5149466 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5149467 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5149468 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5149469 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5149470 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5149471 ik heb er geen enkel moment aan getwijfeld dat je niet in je opzet zou slagen
5149472 i keep you with me in my heart you make it easier when life get hard
5149473 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5149474 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
5149475 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

5149480 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
5149481 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
5149482 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5149483 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5149484 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5149485 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5149486 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5149487 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5149488 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5149489 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5149490 what would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure of america
5149491 the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5149492 he could have avoided that altogether or come up with some other answer
5149493 but he very quickly cleanly and clearly confessed his failure
5149494 the clarity of confessing his failure there will be respect in the evangelical community for doing so
5149495 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5149496 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5149497 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5149498 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5149499 okay we dont have to go longer on that one
5149500 abortion and marriage are still pivotal issues but i think that abortion is probably more pivotal than marriage
5149501 abortion is still very very solid with this group even the younger ones who are more liberal on marriage life is a real delineating factor
5149502 i thought sen obamas statement in quoting matthew 25 which is my favorite scripture since i was in high school whatever you do to the least of my brethren you do likewise to me when as a matter of record he voted against a ban on partial birth abortion well i find it discouraging and disingenuous for him to talk about the least of our brethren

5149511 it just proved to me we had the car to go out and dominate if we had pitted early we would not have won the race i was calling for them to tighten the car up tighten the car up tighten the car up the back end just would not stick

5149514 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5149515 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs

5149519 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5149520 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5149521 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
5149522 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience

5149551 it appears that the federal government is starting to recognise that more staff are needed to get its massive job done cpsu national secretary stephen jones said

5149564 the bad thing is i couldnt play a practice round at pinehurst so ill have to just use my caddie for playing those courses
5149565 this may be linked to the increased possession of small expensive electrical items including mobile phones and mp3 players she said

5149726 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5149727 i guess when i was a teenager i was too cool for it
5149728 a number of years later i was at an antique show and i saw the bank it brought back childhood memories
5149729 i wanted to meet other people who collected mr peanut and i wanted to brag to them that i had all five pieces
5149730 on the trip home we could barely see out of any window
5149731 obici added the top hat and monocle because he wanted it to be classy

5149754 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5149755 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5149756 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5149757 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5149758 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5149759 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
5149760 the uncertainty of canadians is a direct reflection the lack of leadership in health demonstrated by our politicians
5149761 funding has been returned to the system but canadians are still waiting for a renewed vision that will ensure the sustainability of the system
5149762 none of us has been given the power to stand in judgment of each other
5149763 critics of others must stop short of final condemnation for men cannot judge motives as god can believers are not to avoid all judging for christians need to judge themselves and offending members 1 cor 5 3 5 12 13
5149764 judicial decisions nor the expression of our opinions in a proper manner

5149794 hoy no fue posible alcanzar la victoria pero estamos contentos con el resultado seguimos sumando puntos y continuamos entre los punteros del campeonato lo cual es muy importante
5149795 ahora lo esencial ser seguir trabajando para que en las ltimas cuatro carreras abonemos m s puntos a la cuenta personal siempre con el objetivo de pelear el campeonato
5149796 rechazamos que el gobierno federal se lave las manos y pretenda hacer creer que el tema del crimen organizado y del narcotr fico es un tema que corresponde a los gobiernos de los estados y municipios
5149797 consideramos que es fundamental que en el pa s haya colaboraci n y concurrencia para resolver este problema en beneficio de la ciudadan a pero que cada nivel de gobierno debe asumir su responsabilidad y ning n partido debe sacar raja pol tica
5149798 nosotros creemos que es fundamental que en todos los niveles de gobierno se asuman las responsabilidades que corresponden en materia de pol tica de inseguridad y que este es un asunto que no debe tener prop sitos electorales es una preocupaci n de toda la sociedad a la sociedad de la certidumbre de su tranquilidad su confianza su seguridad es lo que le importa no ve partidos politices en eso

5149800 our passing game has not been as consistent with him out
5149801 he definitely adds a spark and is a player we need back
5149802 each and every player knows whats going on and didnt take too much of it to heart
5149803 but as long as he shuts up and produces thats all that matters
5149804 chad being chad hes been loony and kooky since hes been here were much better if hes on our team
5149805 it was extremely important that we won there is still a lot of football to be played but it was a real positive we didnt concede a goal for the eighth time since the final game last season
5149806 it was a good start i was pleased with the three points i think we were a little bit rusty in the first half but we got a little more cohesion in the second half i liked the way they finished the game
5149807 he hasnt played for six months so it was quite outstanding his performance over the course of the game
5149808 i was keeping an eye on him and he went from strength to strength
5149809 much more powerful than we saw in the team finals
5149810 strengthening could begin tonight or sunday and fay could be approaching hurricane strength as it nears western cuba
5149811 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5149817 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5149818 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5149819 cricket with tennis ball is not cricket and playing the gentlemans game with a tennis ball would not make you a sportsperson
5149820 cricket in common parlance does not include tennis ball because it is a discipline which is the abrasion of original cricket game if marks have not been awarded for participation to the petitioner no illegality is seen because every form of ball and bat game cannot be called cricket cricket has a definite connotation as accepted in common parlance and tennis ball is childrens game and not a game as such recognized by the government
5149821 it is not clear how in specific cases chief information officer will impose which type of penalty on the pio it is also not clear whether the first appellate authority can impose penalties
5149822 this is a serious lapse on part of a state level office of the public authority before uploading their proactive disclosure the contents should have been checked by the commissioner this is grave negligence on part of the officers this shows that for senior officers rti and the obligation of proactive disclosure is only a formality
5149823 the website is being developed you can ask the pro
5149824 this should be an eye opener for the heads of all public authorities and they should check what information is being included and uploaded as part of their proactive disclosures
5149825 when we introduced the course we thought that since it is just the first year students many not be very sure of it so we expected a batch of around 40 odd students but the response has been tremendous and i guess we will have to introduce two sections to accommodate over 120 students
5149826 this was a very relevant course in modern times carbon finance is something that has great potential and is still to be tapped the markets are huge and revenue generation capacity enormous
5149827 the course is to encourage students to come up with radical ideas related to policy making dr kalam will provide his wisdom and guidance to students in terms of analyzing policies and come up with better alternatives
5149828 meeting dr kalam is a once in a lifetime opportunity and i would have not missed it i had opted for the course even before i read its outline
5149829 we plan to start courses in coastal management and marine infrastructure management soon presently we are working on the curriculum and course structure people from the industry with technical know how and management background are doing this to ensure optimum employment options for students
5149830 our state has a long coast line which has not been used at all the safety of coastal areas is also a concern which is spurring employment as people are becoming aware of environmental issues

5149857 wi fi pan technology is ideally suited to satisfy consumer demand for high performance wireless voice headsets stereo headphones and speakers by leveraging the wi fi capability already present in many platforms our wi fi pan solution eliminates the need for an additional radio or a dongle now ozmo devices and wolfson microelectronics have teamed to develop a reference design based upon wi fi pan that provides long battery life in very small form factors
5149858 were very pleased to work with wolfson microelectronics to demonstrate this high performance wireless audio product design
5149859 wolfson believes it is a strategic advantage to provide products that support wi fi pan applications
5149860 ozmo devices understands that creating a joint reference design kit such as this enables our customers to make the best high quality products possible
5149861 leveraging the ubiquity and proven technology of wi fi to deliver personal area network connectivity provides significant benefits and eliminates the need for additional radios

5149863 i feel bloated so let me pretend to be healthy by ordering this ginormous salad smothered in cheese blobs
5149864 and during that time you could do it and i think hes freely admitted that that doesnt work now
5149865 id have probably had him get rid of it the first day
5149866 but then i wouldnt have been there the second day
5149867 theyre not going to worry about a little thing like dreadlocks and all that
5149868 my arm felt good and it feels like im moving forward now instead of staying back where i was and hopefully theres good things to come
5149869 were hoping that the inning will take a little bit of the edge off going into his next start on wednesday
5149870 i had a couple of extra days to get some reps in and doing some different things were working on hopefully its that start thats going to make me go back on top of that hill and start going down instead of fighting my way up
5149871 we were getting guys out of the game anyway but he said his back was stiff
5149872 it was just a bad day all the way around
5149873 the pitches they hit were bad pitches they caught too much of the plate and were up you can get away with catching a little too much of the plate if theyre down some days but today was the middle of the plate and up they were just really bad pitches but good pitches to hit
5149874 at least some of our bullpen was rested because of the friday rainout
5149875 today could have been much worse if our bullpen was taxed from the last few days but not a whole lot of positive things to come out of it
5149876 hitting into that double play stopped the momentum that we had we could have come back in that game if i had been able to do something there
5149877 he took a good swing today before he hit into the double play
5149878 i think we all agree that its been very difficult for him offensively but the thing we hang our hat on is you cant tell when hes catching

5149880 according to a syndicated story that appeared in newspapers in 1934 an australian admirer sent walt a gift of two wallabies a male and a female by the time they reached the states they had produced a third according to this story the disney staff promptly named the male wallaby leapo the female hoppo and the baby poucho this of course became an obvious inspiration for the cartoon mickeys kangaroo released the following april joe grant told me in 1988 that the newspaper story was true he remembered the wallabies being kept in a pen outside the story department i asked him if the name that appears on the mailing label in the cartoon leo buring was the name of the real life person who sent the animals to walt and he thought it probably was
5149881 in 1931 buring formed a business partnership with reginald mowat of great western called leo buring amp co his first wine was made from grapes grown at his emu plains property in the early 1930s
5149882 you dont need a perfect credit score but its important that you dont have personal bankruptcies and chargeoffs
5149883 i want to see cash flow projections and a strong understanding of the industry for example if you want to buy a subway location and your business plan assumes a 15 average menu ticket then there is a problem
5149884 and if the insurer is reasonably intelligent and reliably assesses risk
5149885 how annoyed are you by each of the following messes
5149886 there were times where there were more bankruptcies but i dont know if ive ever seen so many people prepared to walk away from their houses
5149887 because of these no income verification no asset loan products that were popular people have no equity and never did
5149888 even in the real estate downturn in the 90s you didnt have people with no equity in their homes
5149889 the ruse concocted by shawn moyer chief information security officer for agura digital security and nathan hamiel senior consultant for idea information security worked like this
5149890 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5149891 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5149892 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5149893 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5149894 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5149895 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
5149896 we are pleased to see that the mva based candidate tested in chennai was safe and showed promising initial immune responses we do not know whether these observed responses will ultimately translate into an effective vaccine that will help protect individuals from hiv infection but hope to learn more through further testing
5149897 india is playing a significant role in global aids vaccine discovery efforts given our strong medical and scientific capabilities there is a need for continued efforts for the creation of novel reliable mechanisms for long term research on aids vaccines and other new prevention technologies
5149898 consistent innovation in science despite setbacks has ensured the development of many effective prevention technologies the successful conduct of the trial in chennai re affirms the need for continued vaccine development initiatives where learnings from every effort will contribute to global advancement of the aids vaccine field
5149899 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5149900 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5149901 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5149902 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization

5149905 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5149906 i look forward to reporting to my colleagues in the senate and on the foreign relations committee as well as the administration about what i learn
5149907 i am not for privatizing social security i never have been i never will be
5149908 i think it would be a great night especially to lose only three seats that would be a terrific night for us absolutely
5149909 i dont want to slip below the four seat loss thats kind of where we set our absolute worst goal is to be down to 45 seats
5149910 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share i dont stay here anymore
5149911 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
5149912 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship i do understand that my baby made this monster but when she was down people took advantage
5149913 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
5149914 the college of dupage a community college in illinois now also posts a monthly treasurers report including the total amount of cash on hand and all receipts and disbursements in addition to investment and debt information checks written in june ranged from a 1 1 million bond payment to 21 574 for advertising in three local newspapers all of which are named thats transparency
5149915 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5149916 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5149917 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5149918 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5149919 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
5149920 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night
5149921 improves sleep and daytime vigilance helping to re organize the circadian system the bodys internal clock
5149922 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
5149923 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
5149924 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
5149925 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
5149926 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
5149927 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
5149928 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
5149929 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it
5149930 gastrin releasing peptide receptor silencing suppresses the tumorigenesis and metastatic potential of neuroblastoma
5149931 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
5149932 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5149933 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5149934 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
5149935 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
5149936 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
5149937 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study
5149938 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
5149939 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
5149940 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
5149941 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
5149942 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
5149943 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
5149944 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
5149945 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
5149946 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
5149947 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
5149948 im amazed that so many athletes are wearing a fabric i tested in a laboratory in hampton virginia
5149949 what we look at are concepts for reducing drag on otherwise smooth surfaces this is more directed toward fundamental physics the interactions between the flow and the surface
5149950 we evaluated the surface roughness effects of nearly 60 fabrics or patterns in one of our small low speed wind tunnels
5149951 we were assessing which fabrics and weaves had the lowest drag the tests have generally shown the smoother the fabric the lower the drag
5149952 the fabric comes in the form of fabric tubes a small diameter fabric tube
5149953 we pull that over our smooth flat model which is an aluminum plate underneath we prepare the edges so theyre straight and square with no protruding corners or edges to interfere with the drag on the surface
5149954 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5149955 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5149956 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5149957 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5149958 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5149959 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5149960 we worked on head mounted displays improved tiled displays rendering and streaming software colour calibration techniques collaboration and networking and novel interaction systems
5149961 better yet the handheld model can also block out daylight so you dont get the usual problem of sunlight washing out the image it is a breakthrough and the daylight blocking hmd will feature this month at siggraph 2008 in los angeles
5149962 it takes a lot of processing power to render a virtual image onto a real landscape mobile device cpus cannot really cope we developed a video streaming protocol that allows a desktop to perform the rendering but then streams a compressed signal across wireless networks
5149963 we are already in discussion with some companies about commercial opportunities for the rendering platform
5149964 in contrast to marker based tracking where we track labels with patterns on it in marker less tracking we detect feature points in real scenes and compare current images from a camera to calibrated reference images of the same scene to calculate the current position of a user
5149965 you get big calibration problems with projectors on multi tiled displays because projectors vary or projector bulbs deteriorate at different rates it affects image quality but our calibration tool ensures faithful colour across the multiple screens
5149966 the mix of applications meant we had to develop low cost but high performance systems the tests were successful and the system performed well
5149967 it is unlikely that the platform will be commercialised as one product but most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available
5149968 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5149969 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5149970 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5149971 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5149972 hey jimmy what are you doing here you need a lift
5149973 it was dirks and he left it to me in his will
5149974 oh i came down to visit my aunt sofia she lives in the panther den rest home over by the stadium thanks for saving me bus fare back up the mountain
5149975 did i ever tell you about working for old snappy lefkowitz
5149976 i had been out of high school for a couple of years and was still trying to find my place in the world
5149977 come get in the car he said to me now granpa was not someone to be disobeyed before he became a policeman he spent five years working in the steel mills up north as the saying goes his muscles had muscles and growing older hadnt diminished him at all
5149978 anyway i dutifully followed him to his car which was very much like this one and he drove us across town to the old jackson building
5149979 granpa walked into the office like he owned the place and said to snappy
5149980 those were different times and granpa was a different kind of man
5149981 well snappy looked at me all gangly arms and legs remember i was only 20
5149982 and said first thing is you need a suit cmon he stood up put on his hat and coat and took me to the tailor
5149983 for the next year and a half i worked hard as snappys errand boy assistant learning all the basics and many of the tricks of the private investigator biz
5149984 i asked endless questions and snappy never failed to answer directly
5149985 it all came to an end at the jackson building christmas party in 1978
5149986 maybe its the spirit of dirk but i feel like splurging a bit lets have some seafood
5149987 well the christmas tree in the lobby was right next to one of those big old radiators
5149988 the longer he waited for someone to speak up the angrier he got poinsettias went flying and the other decorations that had been put up for the party fell to his wrath as he finally approached me i was quaking in my patent leather shoes certain that the guilt was clear on my face snappy must have seen it too cause he stepped in front of the judge and whispered something in his ear
5149989 whatever he said to judge henderson deflated the anger like a tire runing over a nail the judge cast his glare once more around the room then stomped to his private elevator glancing back over his shoulder at snappy who stood there calmy arms crossed
5149990 as soon as the elevator doors closed behind the judge the whole crowd bolted for the doors to get some fresh air
5149991 the stars were dim blocked by the glare radiating from hundreds of empty parking lots
5149992 snappy was silent for a few moments then said quietly as of the new year the office is yours
5149993 he started to walk back to the stairs i was stunned that he was turning over his business to me but recovered just in time to shout what did you say to the judge before he went through the door
5149994 snappy smiled as he replied oh just a couple of things i overheard the judge say to the preachers wife several years ago theres nothing like the smell of sex in the morning and
5149995 what was the other thing snappy overheard the judge say
5149996 as we speak the faith food pantry is providing food for hundreds of people who can no longer afford to feed their families
5149997 gas prices have more than doubled since my opponent took office less than four years ago melissa bean has voted repeatedly against increasing american production and creating american jobs she just cast the deciding vote to let congress take an undeserved five week vacation one which many americans cannot afford due to washingtons inaction the american people need proactive leadership in washington that will stand up for them
5149998 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5149999 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
