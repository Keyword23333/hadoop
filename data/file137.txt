1370052 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1370053 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1370054 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1370055 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1370056 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball

1370085 this additional information helps customers better assess their unique risks and better prioritize deployment of the monthly security update
1370086 the current msrc bulletin severity rating system assumes that exploitation will be successful

1370442 this tyre was probably punctured before it was filled up on 20 june which would explain why the spacesaver wheel was on the car when it was recovered
1370443 it is possible that someone may have witnessed the driver or passenger changing the wheel by the roadside between 20 june and 24 june when adam was shot

1370467 the north face is a company that along with its commitment to social responsibility and the environment is well known for its innovative use of technology in its products
1370468 were excited to work with them along with recurrent energy to design and build a system thats not only economical but also one that incorporates the latest technology and land use techniques thus enabling higher efficiency and having a greater overall impact
1370469 we are pleased to invest in an institution such as ula with its 32 year history and solid reputation

1370475 serverless computing represents a new class of emerging technology where i o and compute resources are closely coupled together to serve the needs of i o intensive workloads with less complexity easier management and higher availability than distributed solutions
1370476 by layering server virtualization on top of their high performance highly available x86 based storage controllers pivot3 allows organizations to harness huge quantities of i o without complex fabrics or complex management we believe that the pivot3 infrastructure delivers a new level of consolidation that will reduce power cooling and space requirements when compared to traditional infrastructures for the right applications needing highly available access to high bandwidth storage pivot3s serverless computing may be a game changing innovation
1370477 power efficiency is a top concern for every new it installation
1370478 with the amount of hype in the market about power savings it is refreshing to see an approach that out and out eliminates equipment these are savings that are easily understood by every participant in the it purchase cycle and in operations
1370479 pivot3 has taken advantage of the openness and high performance of the xen hypervisor to deliver a powerful new architecture for storage subsystems
1370480 xen virtualization is rapidly becoming embedded in all components of enterprise it architectures from servers to storage and network appliances
1370481 this technology offers hard savings to customers with large scale storage and server environments
1370482 in our current video surveillance market a typical customer with 500 cameras will realize real savings of 44 percent in power and cooling costs 51 percent in rack space usage and 22 percent in cost savings by eliminating 15 physical servers and five physical external failover storage chassis we expect these real savings to catch the attention of large scale users in markets beyond video surveillance where power efficiency plays a major role in new product decision making
1370483 as pivot3 works with its partners to apply pivot3 serverless computing to the general marketplace we believe we can enable a significant reduction to the carbon footprint of todays datacenter we intend to help our customers do more on fixed power and physical space constraints while insuring they are as efficient and responsible as technology will allow

1370495 despite countless claims by the government of myanmar that it is moving toward allowing broader political participation u win tin was detained not long after the 1988 demonstrations and remains in prison along with thousands of others
1370496 nothing speaks louder of the governments poor faith than the fact that there are more long standing political prisoners in myanmar now than at any other time since those protests
1370497 while u win tin is the longest serving prisoner of conscience in myanmar he is far from alone
1370498 he has been joined by thousands of others since 1988 roughly 900 in just the past ten months the un should no longer accept the governments hollow assurances but hold myanmar firmly to its word

1370516 as of late 2007 11 of 24 heavily indebted poor countries hipcs surveyed by the international monetary fund were facing litigation from 46 different commercial creditors
1370517 we welcome the strong leadership showed by the congressional co sponsors of this important new legislation vulture funds are grabbing the proceeds from debt relief of some of the poorest countries in the world this bill should make vulture funds think twice before suing the poor for profit
1370518 the stop vulture funds act would protect the worlds poorest countries from the predatory practices of vulture funds and allow these countries to use their limited resources to meet the needs of their people
1370519 the profiteering tactics used by these vulture funds are undercutting progress made towards relieving the debt burdens of the worlds poorest countries
1370520 hr 6796 is a key step in closing the legal loopholes which have allowed these vultures to operate in such a devious way

1370626 probablemente en lo que es la ejecuci n de obra va a haber un impacto mayor no se ha medido hasta el momento pero en insumos como el acero para obras p blicas puede haber alguna aplicaci n o variaci n tal vez m s significativas que la que puede ser en el resto del gobierno federal
1370627 en cada contrato en cada licitaci n que se ejecuta en el gobierno federal y en cualquier otro gobierno sea municipal o estatal cuando es obra p blica siempre hay lo que se llama escalamiento de precios que es la consideraci n de que puede haber incrementos en los costos de las obras porque este sector se ve vulnerado por variables externas en las cuales los costos se pueden llegar a incrementar en algunos casos y est previsto en las licitaciones que se est n realizando en los tres rdenes de gobierno
1370628 puede ser que haya un incremento sin embargo estimamos que ste no es significativo en forma tal que implique una ampliaci n presupuestal importante todo est dentro de los rangos esperados no est haciendo crisis
1370629 en el caso de los combustibles la previsi n estaba hecha desde la aprobaci n del presupuesto de egresos recordemos que la reforma fiscal prev un incremento de 2 centavos mensuales para el caso de gasolina a partir de enero
1370630 hasta el momento no los hemos recibido y pensamos que no tiene impacto importante en el presupuesto
1370631 por el monto respecto del presupuesto de egresos de la federaci n tanto los alimentos como los combustibles no son significativos un incremento en esto no se puede disparar ni se puede hacer la diferencia entre el ejercicio presupuestal decretado por la c mara de diputados con el ejercido no se espera que esto sea un impacto significativo dentro del presupuesto de egresos de la federaci n

1370633 i was just stunned that something like this would happen at our fair because we pride ourselves on calling us a family fair

1370644 those who the gods would destroy they first make mad
1370645 so what the republicans are going to try to do is make you scared of me
1370646 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
1370647 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple things but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much

1370649 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

1370656 he achieved the feat of upsetting one of his countrys key allies the chancellor of germany angela merkel

1370670 whether youve just started dating or have been married for years your social life as a couple tends to revolve around food
1370671 when one person alters that routine it can unwittingly throw off the balance of the relationship or make the other feel rejected
1370672 that doesnt mean announcing youre going to start a new eating program tomorrow
1370673 well you know when youre in the public eye and being governor of florida thats inevitable you know i dont really focus on it im just damn glad i found such a wonderful lady

1370677 harvard was not amused it had identified a genius it had awarded him laurels it had graced him with earthly dignities but he had seen through all its pretensions and glanced the rotten core of its very soul harvard is one of the highest temples to man in our realm it was founded as a protestant seminary and mans usurpation of gods role is inherent if only implicitly in protestantism in catholic christianity not even the pope can change the truth in protestant christianity every single individual person is the arbiter of every single aspect of doctrine belief and morality catholicism is authority protestantism is the absence of authority and the liberal enlightenment thinking which easily superseded protestantism at harvard is the negation of authority communism has ceased to play a part on the world stage but if solzhenitsyn is remembered centuries from now i do not think it will be for his criticism of communism but for his repudiation of the wests rejection of christianity and its embrace of the enlightenment his experience of the prison camps of the east in which humanity was despised allowed solzhenitsyn to see through the vain pomp and glory of the west in which humanity is worshipped solzhenitsyn understood to the incomprehension of the self satisfied elites of our time and place that it was neither communism nor capitalism neither money nor equality neither economics nor politics that should be worshipped but only god
1370678 contraception is another issue where pro life goals of protecting the unborn and fostering a culture of life seem to contradict one another
1370679 the increase in sexual activity among teens during the 1960s provides good evidence of this
1370680 on peut dire que cest un chec ce nest pas une r ussite cest vident on na pas eu le sentiment de donner tout ce que lon pouvait donner

1370687 we will use august 10 to build momentum and make it clear that we are not against one party or the other but the totality of capitalism and its protector the state a few ideas include actions targeting party headquarters blockading recruitment centers dropping banners holding teach ins wheatpasting anti dnc rnc posters showing radical films holding benefits for local organizers in denver and the twin cities protesting corporate donors to the conventions etc
1370688 you have to make so many sacrifices missing friends weddings staying behind on family trips getting together after a race is how i reconnect with the people who are important to me i have to build that into my life otherwise its easy to let it slide
1370689 after being so focused on a race its nice to sit back and enjoy simple pleasures like a good laugh with the family
1370690 you see a lot of court cases from fashion labels that dont want their designs copied
1370691 but a lot of young people see things differently they are used to using the internet exchanging information on a free basis
1370692 everybodys free to use the designs as long as they attribute us as the source
1370693 if they make new works based on this they must publish them under the same creative commons licence
1370694 part of our philosophy is not to be a one man band but to involve the creativity of other designers into the label
1370695 i would really love it if one of our designs gets worked into something completely new and comes back to be part of our collection
1370696 i really believe we will be seeing more of it
1370697 its something happening in many aspects of design and also in science to have more openness and this will definitely happen in fashion
1370698 yes there are people arguing it is demonstrating ideas that dont have a value or a confidence to them and ultimately it is a good way to dilute even the best idea by dividing it up between the lowest common denominators
1370699 but if you look at the case studies and the evidence it provides companies with new ideas and divergent views and greater market opportunities and penetration

1370705 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1370706 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1370707 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1370708 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect

1370730 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1370731 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1370732 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1370733 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

1370762 but its easy to save hundreds of dollars on your bills each year by speaking with your doctor or choosing another insurance plan
1370763 re evaluate your plan annually to ensure it meets your current needs
1370764 take into account your prescriptions regular care needs and mental health and vision expenses
1370765 also consider if youre planning on becoming pregnant within the year because not all plans cover those costs
1370766 dont be scared off by policies with high deductibles the amount you have to pay out of pocket before insurance coverage kicks in
1370767 those plans have cheaper monthly premiums so they may be worth it if your medical needs are minimal
1370768 doctors arent necessarily aware of what screens and exams are covered by your insurance

1370785 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1370786 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1370787 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that

1370834 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1370835 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1370836 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp

1370856 firstly what is in question is whether a debtor creditor relationship actually existed if it did then it is not unreasonable to assume that the member knew or ought to have known and should have disclosed a debt and the name of any other person who may have discharged it

1370961 they used to come over the brow of the hill every evening at 6 40 during the huntley brinkley broadcast in a slow moving tapestry first a doe sniffing the air for possible danger to the two fawns following her then a half grown step brother and finally the antlered sire all nibbling intently as they made their way toward the salt block down the western slope of our farm
1370962 how many thousands of years they and their ancestors had followed that particular track was problematical certainly long before the big stone barn had been raised on the ridge and equipped with hex signs to ward off spells or the cattle these original inhabitants of the land and the pheasants groundhogs squirrels moles and all the other rightful owners of the place had been quietly going about their business of balancing the ecology

1370966 for over the last 200 years youve seen big companies grow off the concept of real time updates
1370967 if you look at media companies like thomson reuters or bloomberg or the stock exchange people and businesses are dependent on real time news coming in as it happens twitter is similar except its much broader than just one kind of news like stock updates so when you think of it that broadly as a utility i think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for twitter as a commercial entity
1370968 how would they respond to us putting ads on the site
1370969 there is a level of intent that someone is showing when they come to a twitter search and type in say iphone
1370970 these folks are influencers and they want to talk about the hottest or latest stuff going on
1370971 if youve got 1 000 people following you somethings happening

1370980 pulitzer prize winning journalist ron suskind claims that after the iraq war began the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein in an attempt to tie hussein to the 9 11 attacks
1370981 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq and that iraq bought yellowcake uranium from niger with the help of al qaeda
1370982 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1370983 now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1370984 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1370985 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses

1371149 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1371150 this news will be welcomed by homebuyers across the country as it will provide some much needed relief to those struggling to get on to or move up the property ladder
1371151 this is the first real sign from the government that it is looking to take practical steps to help spearhead an economic recovery
1371152 if the burden of stamp duty is removed it will create renewed confidence in the housing market helping to halt the current downwards spiral
1371153 if it is true scrapping stamp duty over the short term is likely to entice a surge of buyers back to the market keen to save what could potentially be 1 000s off the value of their next purchase
1371154 however while this is likely to increase activity in what is currently a struggling market we need to see this action coupled with the freeing up of mortgage finance if it is to prove a real success
1371155 by removing stamp duty on all housing transactions the treasury would be opening the door for investors and second home owners to take advantage of the potential savings on offer rather than just assisting those most in need
1371156 a more sensible approach would be to limit this stamp duty holiday to those buyers purchasing a primary residence

1371220 working as an esri business partner better enables our design development and support of arcgis technology based solutions with the stability and simplicity all esri software users have come to expect
1371221 without esri there would be no crossview and without crossview there would be no topographic or subsurface esri software for involved cross section development this relationship just makes it official especially for our customers it gives them peace of mind to know that a prime software has all the needed resources and support from the esri business partner program to make world class products
1371222 a prime software exemplifies the type of developer partner were looking for
1371223 they develop software that addresses a real need in the gis workflow while also respecting the power and intuitiveness of the arcgis interface and operating environment by intelligently developing around our arcobjects developer libraries
1371224 esri relationships are all about flexibility compliance and compatibility with esri software in our corner the benefits are limitless
1371225 while our initial goal was to leverage arcgis technology to make quick cross sections that would make life easier for gis analysts we knew that some might delay purchase until we became a true esri business partner the relationship is crucial because it acknowledges that making an investment in a prime softwares time and cost saving software is a win win win for everyone
1371226 esri has enjoyed many years of successful collaboration with tec

1371318 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
1371319 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
1371320 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
1371321 it was a combination of things financial and emotional my caregiving role all heaped themselves on me at the wrong time
1371322 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
1371323 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
1371324 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
1371325 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
1371326 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees
1371327 provided a whole lot of excuses as to why he didnt comply
1371328 theres really not too much that would allow us to reverse those charges
1371329 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney
1371330 but if youre involved in civil litigation in jeopardy of losing your house or your family what we do is make you go out and find your own attorney
1371331 if we gave people the help they needed near the beginning of their problem their problems wouldnt snowball the way they do
1371332 i think they were treated well and that they should be very happy with the outcome
1371333 people ought to be able to trust the procedure so they understand the outcome
1371334 they look out for the professionalism of each other and this industry
1371335 fairness would indicate that all evidence should be disclosed and if theres a report the consumer should be able to see what evidence is being presented and respond to that evidence
1371336 i think the consumer should see anything that is presented by the inspectors
1371337 many of the items in arbitration are pretty measurable it meets the standards or it doesnt
1371338 there was a huge huge mistake made here and the mistake was by the general contractor hiring someone who was not qualified to do the work
1371339 i thought this could be the best thing that happened to the construction industry and it was not
1371340 its not going to look like a nice smooth brick job
1371341 if consumers were aware that the process included only five minutes of presentation by their homeowner or lawyer and only mba arbitrators theyd think twice about selecting that arbitration option
1371342 and i didnt want people seeing zebra stripes actually the first five world records i broke i swam with two suits on

1371345 for us the olympics are an opportunity to strengthen our brand in the chinese market

1371347 our swift team has worked 14 000 hours since the athens olympics in 2004 and thats to shave off 0 004 of a second in the 100 meters
1371348 it makes me feel like im some sort of action hero
1371349 bike fit has been known to affect sustainable power mechanical efficiency of movement and also peak power or how hard you can push
1371350 its very common after a fit that they can see anywhere between a 3 and 5 improvement in their power output
1371351 for a triathlete that helps them in the overall race because they can get off the bike and run faster
1371352 its exciting for us to have a national team buy one of our machines
1371353 were kind of rooting for the chinese to score a lot of runs
1371354 and the only people who can do that are the 50 meter freestylers and theres only about six of them fast enough in the world
1371355 a lot of it is driven by the almighty dollar and the contracts some of these athletes have
1371356 swimmers break a lot of world records in an olympic year its not the suit
1371357 if that suit had hair on it michael phelps would still win
1371358 mainly from a legal standpoint my view is its up to the governing bodies for each sport to determine the rules of each sport
1371359 the essence of sports is an uncertain outcome theres always going to be somebody who has an advantage
1371360 the former doesnt present an adverse health or safety risk
1371361 in practice they havent gotten it to succeed yet our position is if you tamper with dna youre creating a form of genetic pollution youre tampering with the chemical nature of life you are physically and chemically altering who a person is
1371362 athletes are similar to people with extreme forms of disease theyre desperate
1371363 theyre going to be willing to take a much bigger risk than other people i would be scared out of my mind to try it

1371420 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
1371421 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out
1371422 a trial of this magnitude should have a meaningful public record
1371423 its much harder to trust the verdict of the military jury when evidence and witness testimony is unnecessarily kept secret
1371424 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd

1371556 as of this evening there is a fully executed deal memo all the issues that would have been addressed at trial have been settled
1371557 cant speak to the exact terms of the deal orders in place will stay in place
1371558 kevins was not out to get custody kevins goal was to set up some kind of template so the mother of his children can co parent
1371559 he said i need to have britney to be involved in the coparenting of the kids but i need there to be a structure
1371560 nobody could have anticipated the terms of events that have occurred this was a two year journey that will be halted at a point that is good for these children custody is always modifiable if there is a final order it means there is nothing to try
1371561 while i cant tell you the terms the order does anticipate what happens if the conservatorship is ended
1371562 the devil is always in the details and this is a very detailed deal memo nobody can predict what the future will bring but to the extent possible i think we have really anticipated how to proceed
1371563 at about 8 p m pt a final settlement in the kevin federline britney spears custody case was signed all parties have agreed to the following kevin will retain sole legal and physical custody of sean preston and jayden james britney will continue to have visitation rights which may increase over time the agreement will be presented to the court in the morning for approval by the commissioner
1371564 i tried to warm up before i got here but
1371565 its going to be one of those up and down days well have to see how it goes
1371566 the mediation didnt result in an agreement that would avoid the trial set in august the mood was comfortable positive and it was a mood that was consistent with opening at least a great dialogue which is necessary
1371567 if the existing arrangement was acceptable to both parties we wouldnt have to go to trial
1371568 its very likely both britney and kevin will testify in a trial
1371569 britney has to show the court that shes improved as a mother if she loses the gut wrenching part is that she could miss out on a significant portion of her kids childhoods
1371570 however since shes under conservatorship its unlikely shell win any legal custody
1371571 if she cant make decisions for herself how can she decide things like which doctors schools and religion if any are best for the kids
1371572 its possible that both sides can settle at any time
1371573 you moaned so hard kevin i could think you needed some more
1371574 well it is such a turn on when you cum in my mouth i think when you came down my throat it seemed like a dozen of guys came at the time

1371583 since most of the union membership is muslim a majority of 700 out of 1200 and the contract allows for only a fixed number of paid holidays this change makes sense it also only affects union members for what its worth many people work on labor day its importance as a national holiday has decreased over the years and it doesnt have the significance or traditions that we accord to independence day memorial day thanksgiving or for christians christmas im sure all of this went into consideration for the decision plus with a mostly muslim workforce so few people would come to work on eid al fitr that the plant couldnt operate properly anyway

1371604 to get an accurate picture and be able to compare between products the new pricing system would be a good idea
1371605 a lot of people are cost conscious these days and want to work out what is good value
1371606 i think the new pricing system will make it easier to work out what is good value and it will save time too

1371613 is by far the more important of the two because valsartan and amlodipine are the most commonly prescribed arb ccb combination and this is the first time such a combination has been approved for initial therapy
1371614 patient selection is crucial when it comes to using fixed dose combinations because they are not for every patient a decade ago the pharmaceutical companies were taking out full page ads stating that 80 of patients can be controlled on drug x monotherapy and now they are saying that more than 80 of patients need combination therapy i suspect the truth is somewhere in between with around 50 to 65 of patients needing combinations
1371615 as they are a bit reluctant to be too aggressive in lowering blood pressure too fast
1371616 the accomplish study really has put fixed combinations on the map and therefore physicians have been using them which is not surprising
1371617 so in some ways the fda is belatedly blessing what many physicians have been doing for quite some time
1371618 it is important to get the first line approval for a number of reasons one of which is managed care the fda is moving toward this area and recognizing that high blood pressure is a complex process
1371619 there are two main advantages of fixed dose combinations for the patient
1371620 first the pill burden is reduced and second the patient only has one copayment instead of two
1371621 once amlodipine becomes a wal mart 4 drug its obvious that cost will become an issue

1371720 because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which i commanded you you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground because of you in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life 18thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you and you shall eat the plants of the field 19by the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground for out of it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return
1371721 sin came into the world through one man and death through sin as one trespass led to condemnation for all men so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men
1371722 no one is actually going to take this seriously are they
1371723 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1371724 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1371725 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1371726 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1371727 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1371728 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1371729 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1371730 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1371731 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1371732 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1371733 in one of my visits to bethlehem i heard a story which now i know is just one of many

1371766 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs

1371768 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1371769 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1371770 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1371771 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1371772 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1371773 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1371774 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1371775 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1371776 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1371777 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1371778 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1371779 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1371780 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1371781 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1371782 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1371783 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1371784 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1371785 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1371786 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1371787 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1371788 obese men have less semen more sperm abnormalities and should lose weight before trying for a baby
1371789 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1371790 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1371791 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1371792 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1371793 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1371794 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1371795 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1371796 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1371797 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1371798 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1371799 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1371800 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1371801 dietary intake and nutritional education dine for latino migrant farmworkers
1371802 migrant workers have a low level of food security that is the lack of well balanced food choices readily available at all times to maintain a healthy life
1371803 this can happen seasonally when agricultural work ends or when money runs out at the end of the month
1371804 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1371805 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1371806 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1371807 these data provide unprecedented insight into the toxicity of ems for humans they will change the long held perceptions of the hazards posed by low doses of some genotoxic carcinogens
1371808 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioral and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1371809 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
1371810 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
1371811 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 percent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development
1371812 but the word is getting out just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
1371813 specific cells in the foreskin are favored targets for hiv infection
1371814 also the inside of the foreskin lacks the tough covering that protects most skin from infection
1371815 circumcision status was not associated with any sexual dysfunction or with specific sexual dysfunctions premature ejaculation pain during intercourse erectile dysfunction at follow up visits
1371816 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviors are unlikely to increase they may even decline as we saw in our study
1371817 we were struck by this monumental research that shows circumcision having the greatest efficacy in curbing the spread of heterosexual transmission of hiv to date greater than any vaccine in the pipeline today
1371818 free in both mind and body of concerns over hiv
1371819 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1371820 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1371821 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1371822 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1371823 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1371824 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1371825 i remember thinking oh expletive my boots and my waterproofs were dragging me down im an extremely good swimmer but i couldnt get to the surface i was panicking and my lungs were filling with water when i got to the top after getting my boots off i was dazed and my head was totally numb
1371826 essentially we have been underinvesting in capital stock over a period of time gdp growth has outpaced growth in capital stock formation that means we are running out of productive capacity in the economy and that is very well pointed out by capacity utilisation which is running at 86 at this point in time
1371827 it is unrealistic to expect an economy to continue growing at 5 or 6 if you dont have the capacity in which to do it so it is a necessary investment
1371828 public authorities is the area where we are lagging and there are some challenges to ensure that the governments r568 billion planned infrastructure spend the majority of which is related to provincial and local government delivery actually gets spent on capital projects as opposed to operating expenditure which has been the case in the past
1371829 what private equity brings is a solid retention strategy which the company could never have realised through a listing and an associated employee share scheme
1371830 we will continue to have strong links with the alstom group which remains committed to providing us with technical and engineering support

1371840 crudes decline is giving americans more relief at the pump a gallon of regular gasoline on average fell another penny overnight to 3 871 according to auto club aaa the oil price information service and wright express gas prices have fallen four straight weeks for the first time in december prices are off 5 9 percent from their july high as u s motorists cut back on their driving to save money
1371841 a day after plunging as much as 5 a barrel in a dramatic sell off crude continued its downward trend tuesday as traders sold oil contracts on the belief that prices are still too high in relation to demand and have further room to fall

1371848 we dont have another launch scheduled with space x but that is mostly due to the fact they have a full manifest and it would take quite a bit of time to get on their manifest again our next two launches tacsat 3 and tacsat 4 have been manifest on minotaur 1 and minotaur iv over a year now we support the idea of entrepreneurs working to reduce the cost of space access and will eagerly contract services with them as they are available
1371849 it was a fire that started in some shop along the way that caused the tragedy then
1371850 we did bring most of the important temples under a trust and at naina devi the entry and departure paths along the hillside were separated
1371851 it was a failure to regulate the movement of people especially when one was aware that there is local festival at naina devi at this time of the year says pankaj goswami who has just come back from a pilgrimage to shrikhand a high altitude shrine in kinnaur
1371852 only 250 security personnel to regulate a crowd of thousands during auspicious days was clearly insufficient
1371853 why are such funds not used to improve amenities like access parking spaces drinking water and wash rooms along the way
1371854 not just inadequate police for regulation of peoples movement at the shrine its a failure of the system approach paths are narrow there are encroachments along the way civic amenities are insufficient for the ever increasing number of pilgrims disaster management squads are not there and mobile emergency health care services are lacking
1371855 with my family i often head out visiting temples and duly pay the tax himachal collects on entry
1371856 unlike vaishno devi where the management has improved the entire approach path temples in himachal that i visit have the same old problems that existed a decade earlier
1371857 infrastructure woes at himachal temple shrines a recipe for disaster
1371858 we want to go to mexico to look for talent i know that this sport is growing very fast there and is why we want to visit it to be able to observe all the peleadores mma fighters and to bring us to the best gladiators of mma it is very possible that we have an event in its country so that we want to extend our market and first in the list it is mexico we want to show the best fights to him of the wec to the fanatics of this sport
1371859 its fun i never thought this would happen to me everyone whos in their fifties should have something like this happen
1371860 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1371861 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1371862 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1371863 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1371864 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1371865 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1371866 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1371867 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1371868 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1371869 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1371870 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1371871 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1371872 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1371873 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1371874 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1371875 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs
1371876 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1371877 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1371878 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1371879 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1371880 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1371881 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1371882 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1371883 the size of the infarct is one of the most important predictors of long term left ventricular function in patients with an acute myocardial infarction
1371884 imaging of myocardial infarct size is difficult in the emergency setting as the current gold standard methods of delayed enhanced mri and nuclear medicine techniques are difficult to perform in unstable patients ct is very easy and quick to perform even at the acute phase so we wanted to find out if it can do the same job as mri and potentially provide further information
1371885 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1371886 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1371887 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1371888 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1371889 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations
1371890 i feel blessed to have had this man step up to the plate as well as my best friend to give me a chance at a better quality of life for myself and my two boys
1371891 i know its going to mean a whole new world for my wife
1371892 you could tell she had something wrong with her because she was so tired all the time
1371893 even though its not my kidney that went into her i suspect ill get a bunch of hugs and kisses when i see her later this week
1371894 when the whole batch of doctors handling the surgery come into the room you know the news is not good
1371895 yet i knew there was going to be a kidney out there for her and i still was willing to donate one of mine to someone who i was a good match for
1371896 this exchange was a bit more complicated because it involved three pairs whose recipients could not have found a match if we had only performed two way exchanges
1371897 the fact that each center is in a different state and time zone made the logistics more challenging
1371898 i think they checked everything out in me and on me except my toenails and they may still come after them before i leave
1371899 i knew once i was cleared the first time to be a donor that i had to do it no backing out even though it was a roundabout way of getting marilyn her kidney its all been worth it
1371900 its difficult for the donor since they likely are away from their family and community support when they undergo the surgery
1371901 but with this method in place we hope it will make a dent in the waiting list for transplants since living donated kidneys tend to last twice as long as those taken from a cadaver
1371902 to not let the fear of donating a kidney stop them from giving the gift of life to others
1371903 being on dialysis while it keeps you alive is a terrible quality of life because it makes you so weak
1371904 even then if a transplant hadnt come along eventually i knew i was going to die
1371905 even though it will take me months to recover mentally i know i have my life back i will be able to attend school functions for my sons that i had been too sick to attend in recent years
1371906 why do we need 2 000 civil servants to funnel money from a to b
1371907 two thousand private schools deal with these sorts of problems every day of the week
1371908 absolutely from the economic development perspective the availability of world class entertainment venues contributes substantially to the overall attractiveness of a region our arts and cultural amenities are important community assets as we work to attract top tier companies and workforce talent emphasizing this point is dr john reed ceo of burnham institute who has frequently stated that orlandos community venues project was a contributing factor in his companys decision to establish its east coast operations here in metro orlando

1371961 in un momento in cui il governo dichiara di porre al centro delle proprie preoccupazioni il problema della sicurezza giungono dal censis dati tuttaltro che confortanti litalia detiene il record europeo di morti sul lavoro e sulla strada e questa la vera emergenza e a giudicare dai fatti decisamente sottovalutata
1371962 se litalia il paese in europa dove si muore di pi sulla strada evidente che sono urgenti interventi pi decisi di quelli attuati sinora prosegue cogliati dezza la patente a punti ha dato in un primo tempo buoni frutti ma i suoi effetti non sono sufficienti possiamo e dobbiamo fare di pi come dimostrano anche i risultati raggiunti da altri paesi europei a cominciare da un maggior controllo e una maggiore repressione delle infrazioni pi pericolose al codice della strada dalla riduzione dei limiti di velocit anche in autostrada e dalla messa in sicurezza delle tratte stradali pi pericolose
1371963 ma per arginare la strage degli incidenti stradali sottolinea il presidente di legambiente necessario anche organizzare una mobilit diversa potenziando i trasporti pubblici e la mobilit su ferro sulla quale opportuno spostare gran parte del trasporto merci per togliere i tir dalla strada e dare la possibilit ai pendolari di scegliere il treno il 70 degli spostamenti annuali degli italiani in automobile avviene su una distanza inferiore ai 10 km e il censis rileva come molti degli incendi stradali succedano lungo il tragitto casa lavoro un servizio per i pendolari efficiente consentirebbe senzaltro di ridurre i rischi dincidente

1372001 these young ladies have not expressed any desire to be with their mother or her family

1372003 the courts have failed winklers daughters by placing them in the care of a mother who has shown no remorse for the cold blooded murder of their father domestic violence groups have also failed these girls by their silence in this case giving the appearance that they oppose domestic violence only when it is perpetrated by men
1372004 i help people to raise picked nestlings of passerines and swifts but about this bird i was asked by one person who lives in singapore im not a specialist on asian birds and it is a trouble for me to decide is it any starling or turdidae bird to say how to feed it
1372005 i found it near bukit gombak mrt around blk 346 the bird was sitting when i came closer he wanted to run away but cant walk properly yet so it was easy to catch him
1372006 i found him before going to work and now it has been 1
1372007 now i start to worry about him a bit hes very quiet he makes noise and moves only when i take him into hands all other time hes sitting quietly in a box he never begs for food maybe hes sick but i cant see any damages outside
1372008 would be great if you could help me to identify what kind of bird it is
1372009 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

1372092 your film is being sold in the streets of brooklyn
1372093 i cant believe it this isnt one of those hollywood blockbusters but a low budget film that we put our hearts and souls into it said filmmaker mcclinton karma stanley i know that film bootlegging is a billion dollar business but i never expected this to happen to me i am both flattered that the bootleggers liked the film and also disappointed that the bootleggers will see money before we do
1372094 that phone conversation about the film being bootlegged three weeks before the release date has changed my attitude completely about the bootleg enterprise said executive producer deborah pointer
1372095 let mcclinton and i see some cheddar first our goal now is to turn a negative situation into a blessing we need to make as much money as we can from take no prisoners so that we can make more movies we have scripts and treatments just sitting and waiting for financing because we financed the movie ourselves that is why this was such a blow to us

1372097 the movie had me in tears said ronald johnson for anyone who has ever lived in the projects they can truly identify it was unbelievable ms pointer has the magic touch she keeps it real just like she has done with def poetry and mcclinton stanley should be proud of his directorial debut the movie was fierce

1372438 people were tell ing me this is just a fishing expedition and that id come out with plenty of data but no fish
1372439 i looked at my data bunzow said and i think that we have two transmembrane domains in one of the clones identified by the screens
1372440 that discovery was sufficient for realizing that this approach could lead to the discovery of new receptors
1372441 initially the work was driven by the excitement of identifying a receptor you didnt know anything about
1372442 there was a lot of excitement in the 80s and up through the next 10 years from then on you were left with labs where deorphanizing was the primary focus
1372443 we suddenly had a plethora of targets by 2002 or 2003
1372444 i think that one of the possibilities is that some of these gpc receptors may not have a ligand
1372445 in academic labs 99 of the work on gpcrs is focused on trying to better understand how these receptors function anywhere from structure to biology
1372446 several ligands are missing because we dont know when to find them
1372447 probably presenting in low levels or only secreting at a time when there is a particular response if we dont know when the response happens we cant find the ligand and dont know when to look for it
1372448 companies have stopped deorphanizing because companies realized they had too many gpcrs and pharmacology had to catch up to the pairing with molecular biology
1372449 and in most cases the new transmitter systems were blank canvases they knew very little about the ligand or receptor
1372450 in the late 90s we put a lot of effort into the various activities that would support deorphanization
1372451 opportunistic approach without strong rationale scientifically you didnt know if what you were going to get was going to be useful
1372452 a deorphanization project will cost more in the long run because by definition you are further back in the biology pipeline knowing less about the function and potential disease relevance before you commit resources
1372453 because other technologies are able to give us the targets we needed
1372454 so far there arent many drugs that have come through against deorphanized receptors
1372455 that partially may be a timeline issue but a number of easy to deorphanize receptors dont have important roles in controlling physiology they dont have big effects in the way a beta blocker or antihistamine does in the industry
1372456 i still think lots of new targets are out there gpcrs will undergo a renaissance in the pharma industry
1372457 i think it will reduce the need to carry out very extensive screens and in many cases thats a major expense
1372458 i think big pharmaceutical companies are reeling from 10 years of not being good at making
1372459 i still think lots of new targets are out there gpcrs will undergo a renaissance in the pharma industry

1372494 so while in the past a poor deprived child would have about the same chance of developing a good character as a more affluent one our research suggests that children who were born into deprivation in the 1970s as opposed to the late 1950s were much less likely to develop good character than more affluent groups

1372500 when canon launched the eos 300d back in 2003 it was widely regarded as the first affordable digital slr and secured canon a seemingly indomitable number one spot in the market since then the small canon has gone through three further iterations and the current model the eos 450d offers a feature set and image quality that could only have been dreamed about five years ago and at a price point well below the 300ds however the competition havent been idle spectators and have recently launched a number of cameras that have redefined the entry level segment and undercut the eos 450d in the dslr hierarchy canon has now responded to this mounting pressure by launching a new model one tier below the 450d in its current lineup the eos 1000d it shares bits and pieces with rebels gone by and depending from which angle you look at it the new model is either a stripped down 450d or a reheated 400d its a lower specification camera than the 450d by every measure you might see listed on the shop shelf but is not the huge step down that its market positioning might lead you to expect the headlines are a 10mp sensor 2 5 in lcd monitor 7 point af system and no spot metering like the 400d but gaining live view with both phase and contrast detect af sd sdhc for storage and a control and menu layout that is pretty much identical to the eos 450ds

1372526 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1372527 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1372528 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1372529 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
1372530 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1372531 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1372532 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1372533 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1372534 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1372535 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1372536 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1372537 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1372538 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1372539 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1372540 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1372541 i dont believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook cleaner or shopper and i dont believe the man must be the breadwinner i wouldnt mind staying at home while catherine works

1372550 i think the reality is that we will win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3
1372551 when we look at the total available market we salivate at the notion of converting our existing ps2 universe
1372552 every million units we drop into the ps2 is an annuity thats going to pay out later on for ps3 upgrades and weve got some interesting ideas on how to reach out to those ps2 owners in the us and convert them up
1372553 i think the notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow
1372554 and as a brand nintendos got their thing and were not trying to get the senior citizen group to get into gaming were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
1372555 we would look at technology that helped enable that as oppose to trying to iterate or be derivative off of somebody elses vision
1372556 ten years it goes back to our mantra of ten years technology thats associated with the playstation has to have future proof qualities to it
1372557 i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint

1372561 this could be a big reason why we have what we call the walking wounded and why so many people on drug therapy are having so many problems
1372562 its very simple most doctors consider vitamins and nutrients a waste of time
1372563 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
1372564 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
1372565 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
1372566 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
1372567 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1372568 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1372569 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1372570 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1372571 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1372572 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
1372573 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
1372574 there has definitely been an increase in the volume of harassment and now weve seen an increase in the stakes of the violence that theyre willing to spread in the name of this cause
1372575 but as far as who did it and whether theyre the same people thats something that only time and investigation will determine
1372576 we do have some viable leads that were working on
1372577 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing
1372578 this behavior is antithetical to the core principles of the humane movement
1372579 if animal abusers arent going to stop perpetrating these types of atrocities they ought to be stopped using whatever means necessary what were starting to see is the implementation of that type of strategy
1372580 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1372581 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1372582 we cant let republicans hold this issue hostage because of one vote

1372622 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1372623 the bank has cleared the way for a september rate cut
1372624 we would put this statement firmly in that same category and therefore expect a rate cut in september as long as the intervening data does not warrant a substantial upgrade of the outlook for demand
1372625 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1372626 use all the levers that we have that we control to get the desired outcomes

1372658 due to the international olympic committees strict restrictions on the telecast of olympic events china central televisions telecast rights are only allowed on the chinese mainland therefore all cctv international channels cctv 4 cctv 9 cctv f cctv e will not broadcast the opening and closing ceremony and all the events of the beijing 2008 olympic games
1372659 by combining forces we feel very strongly we have a better chance of protecting these communities and stopping mountaintop removals
1372660 were trying to build a national network of people who will help change federal policies and educate decision makers on mountaintop removal
1372661 one of the biggest tragedies of mountaintop removal is that it has left in its wake some of the worst poverty in the nation
1372662 youd think that with all the billions of dollars being extracted out of these areas the streets should be paved with gold but its the exact opposite
1372663 the vast majority of the profits are going out of those communities
1372664 and whats left behind is a toxic denuded landscape thats not very attractive for future economic development
1372665 i grew up in the mountains and there were trees and plants and lots of wildlife
1372666 people supplemented their income by collecting different herbs ginseng being the most important of them
1372667 its almost like youve been transplanted into the desert someplace
1372668 and mountaintop mining also destroys the water tables and the aquifers underneath were having a lot of heavy metal runoff its killing the streams theyre just gravel pits like drainage ditches people live in the valleys so when it rains were having great floods and all our streams are running with dirt people down here say the kentucky river is too thick to swim and too thin to plow
1372669 dumping mountaintop waste into streams makes it economical for them to do mountaintop removal
1372670 several non governmental organizations supporters and viewers of new tang dynasty tv ntdtv gathered in front of the los angeles federal building on august 1 they demanded that the broadcasting board of governors bbg continue its contract with eutelsat european satellite communication company protestors said that instead of leaving the w5 satellite and transferring broadcasting of voice of america voa and radio free asia rfa to chinese communist regime controlled asia sat 3s satellite the bbg should keep these programs on the w5 satellite and assist ntdtv to resume broadcasting to mainland china
1372671 most of the websites banned by the ccp remains out of reach in mainland china including websites related to the falun gong spiritual practice tibet and the tiananmen massacre
1372672 silence now surrounds the unsolved homicide of robert wone a rising lawyer stabbed to death two years ago police inspector rodney parks said the case will remain open at least until next year when it is reviewed for active leads a standard timeline for unsolved homicides wone lived in oakton va and prior to his death was general counsel at radio free asia
1372673 said the athens municipal radio station has signed an agreement with china radio international that would allow the broadcasting of news and other information in the chinese language in athens
1372674 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
1372675 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
1372676 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
1372677 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america
1372678 petraeus has to couch every bit of optimism in some convoluted formulation to avoid the promised rush of disrespect
1372679 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
1372680 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of sayyid qutb how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is
1372681 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
1372682 therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee
1372683 the investments will be in the region of 100 million dollars and we will launch in the next 12 months
1372684 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because they are not available and because we dont want to take just a 26 percent stake
1372685 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1372686 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1372687 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1372688 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1372689 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1372690 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1372691 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1372692 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1372693 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1372694 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1372695 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1372696 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1372697 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1372698 the accc report identifies many of the structural issues prevalent in the grocery sector but fails to recommend solutions to the concentration of market power held by the three major participants in the industry
1372699 the acccs decision to conduct further investigations into restrictive leases and site access generally is a positive step
1372700 clearly see value in their own company its trading at a significant discount to the sum of the parts
1372701 all i know is that weve proven to be wise by being patient
1372702 had we bought anything at all 12 months ago it would be worth half as much
1372703 we have made many changes to the 2008 m1 compared to the 2007 version and we have improved it a lot valentino is satisfied with our work so far of course the biggest change for us has affected valentinos side only the change of tyre manufacturer after the switch we had a hard time learning how to get the best performance from the new tyres and of course we had no data last however year valentino predicted that changing would be the right thing for him and he was right although of course we werent able to predict how differently the tyre would behave
1372704 we have had to work a lot on the chassis setting and we have also changed the geometry of the bike in order to get a good balance with the tyre character since we moved from 990cc to 800cc higher corner speed is needed in order to get faster lap times and to win therefore we have tried many different chassis settings in order to find out the best of bike geometry centre of gravity rider position wheel base length chassis stiffness and so on
1372705 motogp bikes are not production bikes and thats why i always say that valentino jorge and all motogp riders are not human beings valentino has become more and more satisfied race by race and we have been able to find an ideal set up for him that enabled him to win three races in a row since then casey stoner and his team have found new solutions that have allowed them to make a big step forward and now of course we know that the remaining races will be tough although we are still leading by 25 points after the excellent win in laguna seca
1372706 our competitors great performances is a big push to all of us to improve our m1 further maybe even more than we did during last winter i would especially like to progress the electronic control system and the engine power at the moment there is no need to work more on the chassis although this is something we will have to consider for next season lately we have been experiencing some problems with acceleration on the exit of the corner so we need to work to find better bike geometry and chassis setting alongside the development of the engine control system
1372707 this is a popular discussion at the moment and we are looking at the overall situation do we need to change the rules its true that many riders have crashed this year including jorge who had a very bad series of crashes and also dani pedrosa the question is if these crashes have something to do with the current bike technology we moved from 990cc to 800cc to have safer bikes but the new bikes have a higher cornering speed and this might present a danger for some riders i think that we need to do something and the biggest issue is the electronic control system in any case it is clear that we at yamaha will have to develop a better and better ecs in order to beat our rivals i still think that the m1 is best bike out there although casey has had a string of very impressive results
1372708 the reason i always continue to be confident is because i trust valentino so much i like his way of thinking he is always positive and this rubs off on everyone else he never complains or criticizes on the contrary he is always looking forward and searching for new solutions he has exactly the same approach to problems as i have valentino always has a positive and logical way of thinking like me he has a very good sense of humour and i like this a lot i like him as a person very much the biggest shame is that my age is almost the double his but the level of thinking is the same the only difference is that he is just 29 when i was 29 i never thought about tactics and strategies i have a huge respect for him he is the genius behind the bike
1372709 i like jorge very much he is a good guy and a very good rider honestly he is very different than i had expected before he joined yamaha i was impressed by his mature attitude and his fluent english he is a very smart guy smarter than i expected he has a big talent as a rider he is very smooth and very effective i am sure that in the future he will dominate in motogp at the beginning of the season we started with no ambitions we thought it was too early for him to win a race because he was a rookie he was just supposed to be here to learn about his m1 but then he surprised us with his incredible three pole positions in a row and then with his victory everything happened much earlier than we had expected generally speaking he is a very good entertainer for yamaha and for the spectators his season surpassed expectations early on but of course he has had some problems since then which we are working hard to address
1372710 after the bad crashes he has suffered he has changed his riding style somewhat aiming to improve his confidence in the electronics which can help him before the crash in laguna he was recovering and beginning to find a different way to treat a motogp bike laguna was a great pity very unlucky and another set back but i am still confident for the rest of the season although we will continue not to put any pressure on him and there is no need to hurry his learning process
1372711 i am very satisfied with jorges new crew chief who joined us this year ramon forcada
1372712 kraut demons kraut collection the next is a house disco house producer releasing one 12
1372713 that post rock with lyrics kinda mess it up a bit
1372714 the advertising council u s forest service and the national association of state foresters put the public service announcement together to educate riders about fire safety
1372715 but the psa completely missed the mark and questioned the intentions of responsible ohv riders everywhere
1372716 chief kimbell is to be commended for listening to the concerns of the ohv community
1372717 we support public service announcements that promote responsible riding and we have asked the u s forest service to consult with ohv experts when producing ohv related psas in the future the ohv community is certainly willing to help
1372718 our common interest with the forest service makes it imperative that we work cooperatively on all initiatives intended to address responsible ohv use and the prevention of wildfires
1372719 there is definitely pressure on at the moment for organisations to be looking at where their call centres are located and we are seeing a number of particularly larger operators reassessing their options
1372720 when we looked at the limited availability of space where we were accessibility issues and the costs east bentleigh made the most sense
1372721 were also now looking at taking an additional 2600 square metres which just wouldnt be possible in the city
1372722 the suburbs offer appreciably lower rentals in some cases and higher car parking ratios which can significantly add to a more positive bottom line
1372723 the predominant driver is to secure a more stable workforce with such low levels of unemployment making competition for labour in cbd areas intense and the industry itself growing by at least 10 per annum
1372724 while dungeons are still full rich experiences theyre all split into three different wings and an average wing in an average dungeon will take about an hour and a half to run the great thing is that you dont have to run the wings all in one sitting you could choose to do them over three separate nights
1372725 weve spent the most time of any of our dungeons on lost vale often in other mmos the company will spend a lot of time making sure the beginning of the game is wonderful but the rest of it can sort of peter off but we havent done that with warhammer from start to finish all the way through weve spent the time and resources necessary to make the entire game compelling
1372726 an average wing in an average dungeon will take about an hour and a half to run
1372727 the maximum number of people that you will need to complete any dungeon in the game is 6
1372728 not what has happened but what is recorded makes history
1372729 what does it mean to feel that youre in the wrong body
1372730 where do gender and sexuality intersect and where do they diverge
1372731 bottom line nap is a great value for organizations that have yet to invest in nac for now its all about the price if youre buying a windows 2008 license youre getting the functionality for free in addition as more vendors develop the system health validators needed to expand on present policy enforcement capabilities we expect microsoft nap to mature to the point where it will pose a significant threat to established nac players
1372732 we are going to try to get to know each other and maybe try not to be this daddy and daughter but to be there for each other as friends in the coming years
1372733 has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people the rev
1372734 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
1372735 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies and while a misleading portrait of mr obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the democrats the obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of sen john mccain whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
1372736 theres not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
1372737 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
1372738 asked what are the qualifications of this man to become president of the united states i find him wanting and i expressed some of that and my concerns i sat there and i watched this thing and i just came to a point where i said boy somebodys gotta start talking about some of the real stuff and thats what i felt and thats what i did
1372739 his inexperience and lack of judgment some of that is indicated by the friendships and mentors he had growing up we should be very concerned about it
1372740 a little angry mail but ive had a lot of support from the other side of things too people who have side they appreciated my stating some of this stuff

1372747 delta remains committed to providing a travel experience that maximizes the time our customers spend with us onboard by offering them even more productivity options our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental u s

1372749 we want to apologize to our loyal customers and express our appreciation for their patience by giving all current subscribers an automatic 30 day extension to their mobileme subscription free of charge
1372750 we have recently completed the transition from mac to mobileme unfortunately it was a lot rockier than we had hoped
1372751 another snag we have run into is our use of the word
1372752 i just spent the better part of an hour going through apples phone support maze only to be told that we are basically all hosed for at least a week if you are a mac user and are trying to publish iweb content via this mobileme ss you can forget about it for now it doesnt work period there are huge bugs and apple is well aware of them
1372753 we understand this is a serious issue and apologize for this service interruption we are working hard to restore your service
1372754 thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme mail problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
1372755 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1372756 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1372757 the question before us is who is appearing in the appeal is it the chinese name or the muslim name
1372758 there is no dispute as to the identity of the appellant there is no confusion because the appellant is the same person as the name stated in the appeal application
1372759 the right authority to determine her legal entity is the nrd based on her ic therefore the appellant must get approval from the nrd to change the muslim name to her chinese name which was rejected by the nrd

1372790 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1372791 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1372792 nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
1372793 we are going to try to get to know each other and maybe try not to be this daddy and daughter but to be there for each other as friends in the coming years

1372802 go around put up signs shake some hands see some of the important people in the village
1372803 the campaign is treating alaska as a key battleground state
1372804 its a tough state to move but were making a play
1372805 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
1372806 theres a sense of betrayal with mccain in the fact that he doesnt support it
1372807 theres the sense that hes not any better than a democrat
1372808 i think obamas message is similar to sarahs two years ago
1372809 people want to believe that these really complex public policy questions are going to be solved by what i call glittering generalities
1372810 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
1372811 i think what surprises me is the animosity or the rudeness if theyre republican they say im not even going to talk to you or they hang up
1372812 they really appreciate that people would come to your town and talk to you thats a big thing
1372813 arctic villages last reported gas price was about 10 a gallon and they live right next to anwr
1372814 obama has a lot of east coast liberal staffers in alaska
1372815 has a real grass roots effort alaskans talking to alaskans
1372816 i dont think the views or opinions of alaskans have changed and the views of the republican party still represent the views of most people
1372817 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1372818 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1372819 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1372820 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1372821 i mean this is a closed society in many ways
1372822 the internet provides interesting opportunities for people to express themselves sometimes its open sometimes the filters are there ive talked to the evangelicals who go there who feel like the underground church movement has gotten a few steps forward a step and a half back its really hard to tell
1372823 in terms of effectiveness the so called quiet behind the scenes diplomacy so far is a failure
1372824 on the human rights front as we approach the olympics china really has the worst record and is deteriorating up until today
1372825 the lesson of the ep3 was that its really important to be in a position to have quick communications with a nation as large and as important as china
1372826 they have tested they havent just defied the united states theyve defied you too china
1372827 thats to be seen but i know that theres a structure in place that will make it more likely they will because not only do you have the united states speaking out now you have china speaking out

1373035 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
1373036 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
1373037 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
1373038 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
1373039 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
1373040 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
1373041 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
1373042 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
1373043 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
1373044 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far
1373045 we told the chinese that the building should say something about china and its position in the world as an emerging power
1373046 the design itself is not intended to be a visual interpretation of china itself
1373047 the sense of chinese architecture that were trying to bring out is more incidental a sense of axis and symmetry
1373048 you look at the building and to the untrained observer it doesnt say chinese architecture
1373049 carries with it the influence indirect at least of his home country
1373050 this is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoevers going to become president
1373051 i dont care who the president is when they come in and meet with their secretary of the treasury the federal reserve chairman their top economists it will be a sobering moment
1373052 its upward of 500 billion and counting its a mind boggling number
1373053 clearly when you make a pledge you ought to fulfill it
1373054 the one thing i find hard to explain is why they dont contribute more financially
1373055 most of them make the pledges reluctantly on the basis that the united states wanted them to do it
1373056 there is frustration that nothing is happening in the peace process and so they would be throwing good money after bad
1373057 saudi arabia has historically lived up to its commitments to support the palestinians and will continue to do so
1373058 allegations that saudi arabia has not lived up to its commitments are not correct
1373059 the uae is meeting all commitments for financial aid that were made to the palestinian authority
1373060 in direct and in kind financial aid through multiple channels
1373061 is a tribute to what we can achieve in foreign policy when the cause is right and all parties work together in goodwill
1373062 intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
1373063 customs is trying to send a message that they arent pleased with this petty thuggery stuff
1373064 this involves a blue chip honey trader people couldnt believe this
1373065 they remain free while the case is pending further proceedings
1373066 for good or bad you can make honey in china at low cost its a question of whether you want a protected industry or free trade
1373067 neither alfred l wolff nor any of its employees have been charged for any offence
1373068 these are two very fine people they are not criminals
1373069 everyone knew what was going on we just wanted someone to act
1373070 we decided to poll arizona because there had been a lot of noise in the last week that people thought it might be one of those toss up sorts of states so we wanted to see how much validity there was to that
1373071 damn cool man quantum physics is so much fun wait here comes my train
1373072 i love human beings and hence need a lot of money
1373073 ha ha fucker i got monetization social media facebook app and a new iphone beat that
1373074 both the ferrell and penham families have suffered a tragic loss for those of us privileged to know faith we are truly blessed
1373075 we have notified the mercedes benz dealerships throughout the region they are aware of this vehicle that we are looking for
1373076 het mobiele verhaal heeft vooral een boost gekregen door de komst van de iphone
1373077 en volgens mij zal ook search marketing nog verder uitbreiden onder meer naar lokaal zoeken mobiel zoeken crossmediaal zoeken video audio
1373078 het idee dat online marketing enkel een aanvulling is voor de salesafdeling is vervangen door de terechte opmerking dat online marketing een van de meest meetbare en renderende vormen van marketing is
1373079 microsoft vertelt niet precies wanneer de kwetsbaarheidsdata beschikbaar komen maar een bron vertelt me dat beveiligingsbedrijven tenminste een voorsprong van 24 uur krijgen
1373080 is the relinquishment of the trial by jury and the liberty of the press necessary for your liberty will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty liberty the greatest of all earthly blessings give us that precious jewel and you may take every things else guard with jealous attention the public liberty suspect every one who approaches that jewel
1373081 im sure some people back home thought that i would rob a bank before him
1373082 if he were alive today and you didnt know him or his story i guarantee in less than a week he would be your best friend he was a brute he would foul people playing basketball but that was plummer
1373083 it was great because i was 26 years old by myself with no wife no girlfriend
1373084 it was great having people out there i knew everyone on my team was married
1373085 what im hearing from the fbi and other people is that hes a drug possessed gun toting psychopath now
1373086 every knock on the door could be a teammate or it could be him it scared the shit out of you
1373087 oh for four meant absolutely nothing to me at that time
1373088 the only thing i wanted was to get the season over with
1373089 i stayed in my room it was a scary thing the fbi tells me hes armed and hes dangerous and i know his abilities with weapons
1373090 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1373091 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1373092 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1373093 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1373094 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1373095 because they feared being prosecuted should the program be halted and exposed
1373096 people will ask where theyve been and what have you been doing with them
1373097 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1373098 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1373099 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1373100 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1373101 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1373102 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1373103 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1373104 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1373105 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1373106 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1373107 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1373108 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1373109 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1373110 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1373111 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1373112 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1373113 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1373114 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1373115 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1373116 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1373117 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1373118 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1373119 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1373120 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1373121 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1373122 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1373123 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
1373124 when a client puts you between a rock and a hard place
1373125 you could just see it in the first few hours that something was happening
1373126 but he understood the skills it took to beat the more experienced candidate and he went state to state giving speeches and building a following that is clearly what obama has done
1373127 we wanted this to be a grass roots campaign a campaign of people
1373128 a lot of members understand the seriousness of the situation and the need to act
1373129 usaid has decided to conduct an immediate review of all the grants to determine where financial vulnerabilities exist and how best to address these vulnerabilities to strengthen the program for future success
1373130 i received assurances that usaid and the state department are seized with the gravity of the problems in these programs and that they are actively working to correct the problems
1373131 whether this program should be receiving any money at all
1373132 it affects everybody and you need not be a home owner or have credit or be a consumer
1373133 people are getting used to a new terminology they know all sorts of credit crunch related terms money can be made now but generally its a hugely unfortunate economic time theres a lot of talk about how bad it is
1373134 we are overloaded with money crazy amounts of money from the energy market
1373135 similar economies and share the potential problems of industrialized nations in terms of property price fluctuations and financials
1373136 where markets in developed countries have been going down ours has been going up
1373137 theres a better than 50 percent chance that the cost will be zero
1373138 were either going to spend zero or were going to spend a whole lot more than were talking about here
1373139 central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction
1373140 because of their size and scope fannie and freddies stability is critical to financial market stability investors in our nation and around the world need to know that we understand how important these institutions are to our capital markets broadly and to the u s economy
1373141 leaves no doubt that chinas discriminatory treatment of u s auto parts has no place in the wto system
1373142 the future is what investors care about not today not just a press release
1373143 theres a better than 50 percent chance that the cost will be zero
1373144 were either going to spend zero or were going to spend a whole lot more than were talking about here
1373145 central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction
1373146 because of their size and scope fannie and freddies stability is critical to financial market stability investors in our nation and around the world need to know that we understand how important these institutions are to our capital markets broadly and to the u s economy
1373147 it is clear to us tomatoes do not explain all of the clusters do not explain all of the cases and jalape o peppers themselves also do not explain all the clusters and all the cases
1373148 we have said for some time now that there were not tomatoes in the marketplace from areas that were shipping at the start of the outbreak
1373149 we encourage cdc and fda to complete their investigation of peppers quickly so that either the problem can be identified or if not these products can be cleared as well
1373150 the pace of the trace back process has been frustratingly slow and as a result the entire industry has suffered significantly for an outbreak it did not cause
1373151 it is astonishing to me that the democrats would want to say oh thats great
1373152 this is a wasteful program that will not help the housing correction and will primarily serve as a bailout to those very lenders who foreclosed on homeowners
1373153 i cant imagine how in one breath they could ask me for unlimited authority to give unlimited credit to fannie and freddie and turn around and complain to me that we cant provide relief in this situation
1373154 i find it somewhat hypocritical and most people will as well
1373155 we can let the market adjust and see the last seven or eight years of investment go down the tubes or we can intervene now to reclaim this inventory and protect these neighborhoods
1373156 it is the first time i can think of where we have foreign aid treating a chronic disease
1373157 its a challenge to take this on i think the questions it raises are going to be important ones for the future
1373158 weve never really been confronted with this in the international health arena
1373159 when i picked up my newspaper yesterday i thought i woke up in france but no it turned out it was socialism here in the united states and very going well
1373160 the treasury secretary is now asking for a blank check to buy as much fannie and freddie debt or equity as he wants
1373161 let me stress that there are no immediate plans to access either the proposed liquidity or the proposed capital backstop
1373162 if either authority is used it would be done so only at treasurys discretion under terms and conditions that protect the u s taxpayer and are agreed to by both treasury
1373163 i appreciate the positive reaction this plan has received from many members of congress i urge members to move quickly to enact the plan in its entirety along with the good oversight legislation that we have recommended for both fannie mae and freddie mac
1373164 we must ensure they can continue providing access to mortgage credit during this time of financial stress
1373165 if youve got a bazooka and people know you may not need to take it out
1373166 by increasing confidence it will greatly reduce the likelihood it will ever be used
1373167 it would be irresponsible for congress to provide the proposed new authority without doing due diligence on the mechanics of the treasury proposal and its potential implications for taxpayers
1373168 hearings should be scheduled to give taxpayers the answers and assurances they deserve
1373169 to provide both the financial support and the volunteer efforts needed for the passage of proposition 8
1373170 mrs brockovich is an internationally sought after speaker and we are honored that she has made time in her busy schedule for us
1373171 for every need that needed to be addressed there was a new agency created to handle that
1373172 there wasnt any uniform central planning of any of this it just evolved over time
1373173 i am looking forward to working with the people at large software and promoting their great software
1373174 corporations are often stuffy and their youtube tactics and blogs can be boring large software has a totally fresh approach to marketing and they get my sense of humor
1373175 our product pc tune up is a product for the masses
1373176 parents seniors kids can all use our product to return their pc systems back to peak performance so we wanted our sponsor to be just as universal we arent your usual software company and i think by striking a deal with bassmaster proves that and our users can have a great time watching ed and seeing what he does next
1373177 we were so impressed by the creativity and support that holly has shown that we knew immediately we wanted to help holly in her efforts to support canadian athletes
1373178 the summer games begin this week and canadians across the country can show their support for the canadian team by buying one of hollys wristbands at 3 00 each they couldnt be more affordable and imagine how great it would be to see canadians everywhere wearing them during the games to show their support
1373179 i decided to sell wristbands to support canadian athletes because i really enjoyed watching the 2006 olympics on tv and i really enjoy sports myself
1373180 i started selling the wristbands at my school and have sold over 25 000 across canada
1373181 traveling buying our equipment paying our coaches usually is quite a financial struggle with organizations like the canfund around to help out and little girls like holly selling wristbands makes it a lot easier
1373182 hollys initiative is proof that a small decision and a small person can make a really big difference
1373183 this project represents a new direction of technology development for re2 and will build upon re2s strong background in robotics research and robust software engineering capabilities to provide a solution that meets the needs of todays military
1373184 in addition to improving our militarys ability to safely navigate through hostile environments we envision that this technology will also be applicable to commercial markets in the future thus expanding our product offerings outside of the department of defense
1373185 increased end user awareness and ongoing advances in technology are helping shape better products and services

1373188 were looking forward to continuing our execution in providing solutions to compelling customer challenges such as endpoint identity provisioning and monitoring in support of network authentication and network access control nac
1373189 as demand grows for better utilization of data center assets and improved security network teams are responding by deploying powerful new tools that constantly monitor the network and detect problems early
1373190 we help maximize the value of these tools by providing them the data they need from anywhere in the data center our intuitive user interface makes configuring the system fast and easy
1373191 our customers told us they needed a system that was extremely simple to use their network teams did not have the time to learn and use a system that uses complex command line interfaces
1373192 the significant increase in online consumer credit applications that sparta is receiving through this aggregator partner validates our investment over the last three years in the development of our iplus credit decisioning software iplus allows us on a scalable basis to process increased volumes of applications without a proportional increase in staffing levels and other operating costs
1373193 this increased application flow further reinforces the fact that despite the problems in other sectors of the credit markets consumer interest in acquiring powersports vehicles continues to grow we attribute this at least in part to the growing number of people who are reacting to record high gas prices by choosing motorcycles or scooters as a much more economical way to meet their commuting and local travel needs
1373194 were anticipating that the online portion of our business will continue to contribute to the substantial increase in the value of our overall portfolio
1373195 orders for zaps full line of electric vehicles have been increasing as a result of the companys rapidly expanding dealer network
1373196 this is the opportunity of a lifetime for zap and we are ready to seize the moment
1373197 techsoup is often the first stop for nonprofits looking for software and advice
1373198 for decades weve helped thousands of nonprofits manage their operations with technology it only makes sense for us to participate in the techsoup stock donation model so we can help smaller organizations acquire much needed resources for greater accountability increased funds and more time to focus on their missions
1373199 our partnership with sage software will enable us to deliver an even more comprehensive range of tools to help the organizations we serve operate more effectively
1373200 disasters can have a serious impact on your organization if you cant recover quickly

1373208 the night that biggie was killed the networks kept showing the scene of the crime and i noticed that think big posters were plastered all over the suv to commemorate him i thought it would be a great idea to name my new company that the thing is the company wouldnt start for another 4 years but the name stuck
1373209 energy gave me that spark i needed to go after my dream and make his dreams come true at the same time
1373210 g fiive is a natural entertainer and i wanted to hone in on his ability and perfect it
1373211 the goal is to saturate the internet as well as the streets with presence while gradually bringing awareness to the mainstream once this is established we will utilize the film arm of the company and give g fiive the visual affects he needs from video to short films
1373212 you could just see it in the first few hours that something was happening
1373213 but he understood the skills it took to beat the more experienced candidate and he went state to state giving speeches and building a following that is clearly what obama has done

1373219 csps service and systems integration business reported solid results in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 while the systems business continues to be affected by the shifting of military priorities away from strategic programs
1373220 our year over year comparisons are challenged for the three and nine month periods as we reported a significant amount of systems revenue in fiscal 2007 from a major supply contract with raytheon
1373221 in fiscal 2008 we are recording systems revenue from a number of small multicomputer contracts in contrast to the large contract we were awarded last year in addition contracts that previously had been delayed and were expected to result in revenue in the second half of fiscal 2008 have now been pushed out to fiscal 2009 as a result we now expect that revenues for the second half of fiscal 2008 from our systems business will approximate those from the first half of the year
1373222 during the fourth quarter our systems business will introduce a hybrid computing platform through our previously announced partnership with annapolis micro systems
1373223 the new platform will include annapolis innovative design and development tools on a field programmable gate array fpga integrated chip within our fastcluster rugged computing platform this hybrid fastcluster computing environment is capable of supporting hundreds of hybrid compute blades and includes a broad set of libraries diagnostics and development tools that promote collaboration productivity and portability we are excited to be offering a high quality hybrid computing solution to military and commercial customers
1373224 csps service and systems integration business continued to perform well across each of its subsidiaries in the third quarter
1373225 our german subsidiary is capitalizing on demand for its professional service practices including lifecycle management archiving and network migration and security in the united states our systems and solutions division ssd which provides it infrastructure solutions is leveraging an expanded sales force to generate excellent sales growth we also are pleased with our u k subsidiary which reported another profitable quarter
1373226 as we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2008 we remain cautiously optimistic about the demand environment and the opportunities we are seeing at our service and systems integration business however we are keeping a watchful eye for any changes in the economies of the countries in which we operate we are focused on continuing to grow this business organically as well as through strategic acquisitions that would provide complementary technical or geographic practices

1373230 our webinars are designed to help decision makers build a plan and map out a strategy to achieve their ultimate goal which is to roll out unified communications in a controlled manner with as few hiccups as possible
1373231 are you calling me a racist youre calling me a racist
1373232 interestingly calling someone a racist has become a worse offense than actually being one
1373233 you should know that neal declares unequivocally that mccain is not a racist and says obama probably is
1373234 dreams from my father is a staggeringly beautiful book lyrical powerful and poetic it is also the story of a man who has been many men all named barack obama in his own eyes he is one race but also another he is an american but also a kenyan he is from hawaii and also the kansas heartland he is harvard elite then the chicago streets at times he decries the very clay from which he was made only to remake himself again
1373235 theres only one good f left in him and its keeping him alive
1373236 i remain entirely skeptical that democracy is possible in a country without a stable middle class and a reliable rule of law
1373237 in reality pollack and ohanlon were not only among the biggest cheerleaders for the war but repeatedly praised the pentagons strategy in iraq and continuously assured americans things were going well they are among the primary authors and principal deceivers responsible for this disaster
1373238 the complicated reality of the war in iraq is that everyone has been wrong about it at some point
1373239 it was some internal stuff i needed to get done
1373240 perhaps in hindsight i should have waited until the office investigation was done hes a very good writer
1373241 it was some internal stuff i needed to get done
1373242 perhaps in hindsight i should have waited until the office investigation was done hes a very good writer
1373243 she was always a step behind it wasnt effort and it wasnt ability she worked hard her mom worked with her and she still was behind

1373248 initial analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1373249 this is part of a pattern of misrepresentations and evasions on the part of chery that we detail in our complaint
1373250 the package was addressed to president yin and came from our attorney andrew kochanowski of somers schwartz silver an attorney and law firm with which chery is quite familiar
1373251 chery has already been served by our providing the complaint to their agent in the united states an attorney in michigan

1373253 the agreement is of vital importance for petrolia not only if you consider the amounts invested but especially because of the considerable oil potential associated with this type of trap the discovery of hydrocarbons in such a context would open wide the door to oil exploration in the gaspes peninsula

1373258 we are particularly appreciative this year for every race participant volunteer and sponsor who is dedicated to helping us end breast cancer forever i realize that people are choosing carefully where they invest their time and resources
1373259 the progress weve made in breast cancer research and in our local breast health screening and outreach would be impossible without the advocates who realize that breast cancer is an urgent issue that wont wait
1373260 every year i am inspired by the women and families that come together for the race they are survivors family members of loved ones lost and volunteers willing to help out in any way possible
1373261 it rejuvenates our cause and brings new hope to fulfilling the komen promise of bringing an end to breast cancer and the pain it causes so many people in our community and the world

1373277 24 hours to zero down marketing strategy guide and workbook
1373278 marketing is essential but it does not have to be expensive rocket science
1373279 women and family owned business can make money by marketing their products online and offline without a large budget and while at home i worked through labor and delivery of one of my kids and my goal in life is to prevent any women from ever having to do that i promise this will help
1373280 how can i display a phone number when making a call from skype
1373281 hi there wilhelm lack thanks for buying a skypein number were happy to confirm your payment you should be able to start using your number immediately your new skypein number is in most cases you can immediately start using the product you bought however in some cases you may have to wait up to an hour for it to activate
1373282 sorry for the trouble we havnt got your email so i should explain at here prettymay support monday mar 10
1373283 i tryied the reial version but the normal telephones can not activate the extensions numbers
1373284 things that will look stupid later should this go horribly wrong
1373285 if you would have given me this tuesdays newspaper on monday night i would have lost money on tuesday
1373286 this is my first birthday present these guys gave me the best present
1373287 they are perfectly the same as their daddy i am in heaven here i am a happy person
1373288 for my next project i will consider cloning camels for rich people in the middle east
1373289 ok whatev just as long as you didnt go home with her no biggie
1373290 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1373291 i doubt if well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1373292 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1373293 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1373294 the matter is now closed trust me he will play here next season
1373295 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1373296 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1373297 however i agree that it is a case of systematic doping this would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban
1373298 i shouldnt really say very much as i am no longer a part of the iaaf but this is a very bad story
1373299 i find it frustrating that such planned cheating is still going on i am very disappointed
1373300 of course the procedure is still going on and it is for the russian federation to find out what was going on
1373301 too rich too sweet too salty and which are not strictly necessary
1373302 we have not banned the word obese but we have chosen not to use it
1373303 theres no point giving them a letter that doesnt have any impact on their behaviour
1373304 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1373305 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1373306 est n finalizando negociaciones para filmar una cinta de suspenso ambientada en una prisi n llamada scared straight
1373307 life online is easier im positive they invented the internet and world wide web for busy women
1373308 everything i need to do purchase sell and find is all online how convenient is that i wanted everyone to know how to use the offerings and tool available online
1373309 we could totally see us on the ellen show helping all the women in the world learn how to blog ping pod etc and we loved the idea of women using this knowledge to get better jobs work from home and succeed online
1373310 as an educator i thought it would be fun to teach something everyone wants and needs to learn
1373311 or something of the sort its becoming easier to move a blog from blogger to wordpress so i will definitely be making the transition
1373312 technological advances have allowed us to explore oil offshore in ways that protect the environment
1373313 could produce enough oil to match americas current production for almost 10 years
1373314 the american people are saying loud and clear there is no ambiguity about it they want us to do something about it and they understand the laws of supply and demand
1373315 one of the raps on me when i first ran for congress in the african american community was hes too close to the jewish community you can look this up all his friends are jews hes from hyde park hes from the
1373316 barack said i want to run this like a business and ive tried to help do that
1373317 in case youre not living in the real world being driven around by
1373318 could result in an unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land
1373319 if our nation is serious about regulating greenhouse gases the clean air act is the wrong tool for the job
1373320 its really at the feet of congress to come up with good legislation that cuts through literally decades of regulation and litigation
1373321 transparency in my 27 years at epa i dont recall an administrator doing what i have just done
1373322 as the comments from other cabinet secretaries and administration officials make clear the onerous command and control regulation contemplated in the epa staff draft would impose crippling costs on the economy in the form of a massive hidden tax without even ensuring that the intended overall emissions reductions occur
1373323 unlike many well capitalized savings and loans and commercial banks fannie and freddie have chosen not to manage that risk by holding greater capital
1373324 w e cannot account for the psychological impacts of this kind of talk which can create its own reality
1373325 we are managing our business and maintaining a capital position that will allow us to fulfill our congressionally chartered mission now and in the future
1373326 we have the power to respond if there are crises
1373327 what we are looking for are rules that will make the crises less likely
1373328 and i hope that early next year we will be able to complete it
1373329 that will clearly take some time to consider and to get the legislation through
1373330 i gather what youre saying is it is better in this very complex and very important set of issues that we do it right than that we do it very quickly
1373331 were not saying take forever but we recognize the fact that the regulatory structure hasnt been changed in a long time and that its not going to be easy
1373332 a major advantage of this structure is its timelessness and its flexibility
1373333 because it is organized by regulatory objective it can more easily respond and adapt to the ever changing marketplace
1373334 i would do it again i think it was necessary to protect the financial system i dont want to do it again
1373335 the council on environmental quality ceq and the office of the vice president ovp were seeking deletions to the cdc testimony
1373336 ceq requested that i work with cdc to remove from the testimony any discussion of the human health consequences of climate change
1373337 im interested in helping inform the next administration to help make those decisions while recognizing congress could act to pass a better law
1373338 every document related to the agencys finding that global warming poses a danger to the public
1373339 im calling on mr johnson to act now and if he doesnt have the courage or the strength or determination to act he should resign
1373340 it requires consultation between the sec and the fed in areas that the sec had thought previously were its exclusive business but the world has changed
1373341 once you try to do a major overhaul you get into a lot of turf wars and you can get very bogged down
1373342 this is working within the existing system which can be a more effective way to go
1373343 information and analysis regarding the financial condition risk management systems internal controls and capital liquidity and funding resources
1373344 this agreement will permit the expanded sharing of information on a confidential basis
1373345 and help ensure that regulated entities receive a coherent message from uncle sam
1373346 there will come a time when you might have to decide who lives and dies out there its a terrible responsibility but its one you will have to make as a rescue swimmer the bigger reality is its also something you are going to have to live with as a human being
1373347 i love it that means the ads are totally calvin totally provocative and a little controversial
1373348 in the commercial youll see me rolling around in bed a lot thats basically all i do i have been a fan of calvin kleins obsession ads since i can remember
1373349 i love to feel super feminine i love dresses and skirts and dislike jeans i think what makes a woman sexy is confidence
1373350 la riqueza de ayudar a las hijas no la podemos disfrutar nosotras solas
1373351 cuando las abuelas solucionan estos problemas est n impidiendo de alguna forma que sus hijas negocien con sus parejas

1373356 in order to address climate change all major economies must be at the table
1373357 and thats what took place today the g 8 expressed our desire to have a significant reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 we made it clear and the other nations agreed that they must also participate in an ambitious goal with interim goals and interim plans to enable the world to successfully address climate change
1373358 by protecting our environment and resisting protectionism and fighting disease and promoting development and improving the daily life for millions around the world we serve both our interests as americans and we serve the interest of the world
1373359 while the timing is uncertain the handwriting appears to be on the wall that change is coming
1373360 it would be a disservice to u s issuers and investors and the american market as a whole if the sec were not looking at ifrs for u s companies
1373361 clearly the use of ifrs has become a global movement
1373362 if you run against a self funder the laws no longer going to help you out it will be potentially game changing
1373363 it is a very difficult situation it is a challenge we are doing what we have to do
1373364 he can meet voters while we are trying to meet voters and raise money
1373365 it would be much better if the u s medical system had not been in the process of spinning out of control for a good number of years now
1373366 our focus is more on procedure than on people wanting to come to new zealand for a nice holiday
1373367 the truth is who we really want in office are world citizens who have travelled widely attended schools all over the world and worked in a variety of countries and yes we want them to have citizenships from all over the globe because in the end we benefit as a people
1373368 common sense tells us that the few who aspire to political office while at the same time having a foreign citizenship are giving up something valuable an easier life abroad in order to make a contribution in a much more difficult environment should they be penalized
1373369 we can say that cars today are much safer than they were 30 years ago and we have the government safety ratings system in part to thank for that
1373370 the new ratings will improve passenger safety with challenging new tests and by looking at additional and improved injury data
1373371 what we have here is weve got a lot of little changes to the new car assessment program but i dont think theres any kind of paradigm shift in terms of a fundamental change that would drive designers in new directions
1373372 in an ideal world i would like to have seen them propose a different frontal crash test one that took into account running head on into a tree or a pole or one with slight overlap
1373373 that would be a paradigm shift that would mean the government was rating a different kind of crash
1373374 is it a phantom a demon or the devil himself

1373381 en la actualidad es muy f cil que los aut cratas tengan xito en instalar una democracia fraudulenta
1373382 eso se debe a que demasiados gobiernos occidentales insisten en que haya elecciones pero no pasan de ah no presionan a los gobiernos en cuanto a cuestiones cruciales de derechos humanos que hacen que la democracia funcione una prensa libre la reuni n pac fica y una sociedad civil en funcionamiento que realmente pueda desafiar al poder
1373383 la situaci n en somalia y en la regi n de ogaden en etiop a donde millones de personas est n sufriendo es una tragedia olvidada

1373393 the afghan army now interacts with the taliban and other enemies of afghanistan and theyre doing extremely well against them
1373394 were seeing and experiencing more situations whereby the afghans have taken the lead
1373395 theyre not completely independent but were getting closer every day
1373396 we went over to them and asked them about what was going on
1373397 we all know ncos are the backbone of any army
1373398 as we increase their capabilities you have to have the right noncommissioned officers leading those squads and platoons
1373399 weve worked very hard in our mission to bring up the capacity and the capability of the afghan army and the police
1373400 and weve done it with a lot of american blood
1373401 its absolutely absolutely a difficult fight theres no doubt about it
1373402 nothing that we do over here is easy but we do have momentum and i feel very optimistic about things in the future
1373403 the equipment will give the ana another significant improvement in their tactical capability and their ability to take the fight to the insurgency
1373404 through the efforts of very many brave men and women tough men and women soldiers sailors airmen and marines were completing the mission
1373405 and were setting the stages for the future operations and for the future of the afghan army and the police in bringing stability to this country

1373425 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1373426 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1373427 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1373428 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1373429 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues
1373430 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1373431 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1373432 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1373433 her recovery will be a long process and she is getting all the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step of the way
1373434 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1373435 our president is the target of a political conspiracy and we are convinced that the conspiracy is led by the state president mbeki
1373436 if you touch the old man you must touch us first nobody will arrest zuma as long as we are alive
1373437 before you get to him you must kill the youth of this country we are prepared to die for zuma
1373438 critical questions about the right of all citizens to equal protection by the constitution and fair treatment by state institutions
1373439 theyre playing with fundamentally new technologies new market niches new services new supply and distribution chains even new business models entirely at this point they dont have much scale or reach they may not even have much capitalization but for some of them that will all change we need to put on the glasses theyre wearing we need to look at the marketplace and our business the way they do theyre giving us clues as to where our future competition will be and if we dont confront these issues right away all our fame and fortune today wont be enough to sustain our position tomorrow
1373440 to be honest he is not that flash as you would expect he is disappointed in himself and a lot of people are disappointed in him
1373441 there is no issue there with his future at collingwood he is hell bent on playing and making amends for an unfortunate error of judgment
1373442 as he stated yesterday he is sorry for what has happened when he returns in 2009 he wants to make amends obviously there is no defence for what happened and he understands as a result he has to pay a heavy price
1373443 he has broken the player code and was out drinking since thursday and on saturday and sunday
1373444 thats not acceptable when you are a league footballer these days its not the same culture as it once was
1373445 he really hasnt got a leg to stand on in a lot of areas
1373446 we will be endeavouring to make sure everyone is adequately compensated and that everyone can move on with their lives
1373447 heath has taken his punishment he has lost his licence and has been fined the law process is taking care of that side of it and the club today took care of the other side of it
1373448 their aim is to use simple means to attack the chinese government and to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1373449 one wrong word and you can end up in prison
1373450 i can only wear a long dress and headscarf at home because it is forbidden at my university
1373451 muslim citizens should not believe the lies of those who want to organise illegal trips
1373452 even small children tell me xinjiang belongs to the uighurs so i should go back to china
1373453 to be honest in the bottom of my heart i dont like uighurs though some of them are my friends
1373454 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1373455 the type of soil youd probably have in your backyard
1373456 it is an intensely dry place it even looks like mars
1373457 people have been growing crops in the atacama desert they have grown beans and sweet corn all sorts of stuff i have been there and eaten it
1373458 brendan frasier as an immortal hero up against an immortal villain is just one of many ideas
1373459 rick because he was treated by the pool of eternal life rick is now immortal id love to explore how that plays out for him
1373460 another spoiler jonathan john hannah winds up with the artifact in this film and he doesnt realize nor do we what its powers are
1373461 he was a lovely fun loving guy he made a big mark on australian country music
1373462 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1373463 this was because a computer tracked down time for the machines and supervisors queried operators over any stoppages
1373464 i feel great ive been training with the world record in mind in the 400m freestyle
1373465 its my understanding that park has said hes going to break the world record and if he does that it will be a very good result
1373466 the reason it has been such a good world record is that it was set by ian thorpe who is a phenomenal swimmer park has said that hell break it so well have to see how well he swims and what he can do
1373467 frankly it is impossible to predict how and when this volatility will play out or what the next round of bad news will be
1373468 in the meantime it will continue to be a difficult time for our industry
1373469 notwithstanding this our strategy remains the right one and we are focused on achieving our goals by the end of 2012
1373470 this season theres a sentiment of anything goes with flamboyant prints intense colours and a variety of silhouettes
1373471 im always partial to fresh whites which there are plenty of this season and i also love a lot of colour which kirrily and collette have plenty of
1373472 i wish to work towards a strengthening of this relationship during my parliamentary career
1373473 ive had a lot of discussions with a lot of people
1373474 its been really nice to get to know a lot of political players and political strategists in canberra whether youd call it a courting i dont know but certainly weve had lots of discussions
1373475 hes high up in the liberal party and it was like a ghost telling me to stand as an independent
1373476 i quit for exactly the same reason im choosing to stand as a federal candidate
1373477 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1373478 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1373479 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1373480 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1373481 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1373482 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1373483 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab
1373484 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1373485 the market had been fully priced for a cut in october but that has been forward to next month
1373486 most of the market had thought there was an easing bias but the language was much more lucid than we thought
1373487 that doesnt mean its a done deal the data will matter a lot but i think they will cut rates sooner rather than later
1373488 the banks have said the cuts might not all be passed on so the market is expecting two cuts by the end of november
1373489 the reaction looks a little bit overdone but it was a very strongly worded statement i dont think they would say what they have said and then sit on the sidelines for months
1373490 were not in a traditional recession dynamic where jobs get cut aggressively
1373491 are a strong headwind and at this level they have got a high risk that they are going to prolong the slowdown
1373492 i dont believe this situation avails itself of quick fixes
1373493 there are questions in the short term about the ability to meet the demand
1373494 it is not seeing the dramatic plunges in jobs that characterized prior recessions but the collapse of the housing bubble is slowly sinking more and more sectors of the economy
1373495 we cant have an effective agreement unless china and india are a part of it
1373496 its as simple as that im going to remind our partners thats the case
1373497 sustainable development has to be supported by both financial resources and technological resources
1373498 until that happens how do you expect the developing countries to take up quantitative restrictions
1373499 even if no new cases are filed it might take 10 years for the department of justice to clear its desk cases in the backlog represent a lot of money being left on the table
1373500 its just flatly absurd for us to be five years into this war
1373501 you are not going to be able to buy 3billion worth of water unless you change the rules and get the market established
1373502 it is a guessing game you have to play where you tell the government how much water you are willing to supply and for what price and the government comes back and says we wont buy any water from you at that price guess lower
1373503 if you are only prepared to pay the lowest price for water that is the water you are going be buying
1373504 in fact we had information from a number of irrigation schemes they believed people were selling out because they had zero allocation for a number of years and this was their distressed sale
1373505 anyone who had a choice is waiting to sell their permanent water rights for a much higher price
1373506 for a temporary trade at certain times of the year in certain valleys there is no reason you wouldnt get 1000 ml and you know what the trading rules are
1373507 mccain likes to say he would rather lose an election than lose a war to this i guess his campaign is now awkwardly adding that he would rather lose an election than have terrorists succeed in another attack the sad part is that now we are having this conversation we can look forward to days of cable news chatter over the issue and meta chatter about who benefits from the chatter is it a dark atwaterian rovian ploy or another embarrassing mccain campaign stumble
1373508 put the purchasing power of the united states government on the side of green technology
1373509 every year the federal government buys upwards of 60 000 cars and other vehicles not including military or law enforcement vehicles
1373510 from now on were going to make those civilian vehicles flex fuel capable plug in hybrid or cars fueled by clean natural gas
1373511 by retrofitting where possible and by applying a higher efficiency standard to new buildings leased or purchased we can save taxpayers billions of dollars in energy costs and move the market in the direction of green technology
1373512 increase purchase of alternative fuel hybrid and plug in hybrid electric vehicles when commercially available
1373513 reduce petroleum consumption in fleet vehicles by 2 percent annually through 2015
1373514 i almost felt like writing her a note i like you

1373516 to choose between the right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations
1373517 the resulting drag on first amendment rights is not constitutional
1373518 whats most significant here is what this means for the future
1373519 it tells us that the long standing limits on corporate and union campaign spending are in grave danger
1373520 what were seeing is the court wants to limit the ability of the government to regulate political speech
1373521 i think there are few restrictions on political speech that will survive this courts analysis
1373522 the supreme court decision today on the millionaires amendment has no impact on the central component of mccain feingold which is the soft money ban
1373523 that soft money ban which the supreme court has upheld has revolutionized political fundraising in this country
1373524 never believed it was a core component of campaign finance reform
1373525 the idea that they would refuse to sign a final order that is the height of amazing nerve
1373526 the global mass transit markets present a great opportunity for otis advanced contactless payment solutions
1373527 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1373528 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1373529 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1373530 they were frustrated things had not gone smoothly and they were keen to get going
1373531 they were very excited about the trip they werefrustrated and suffering anxiety because things were not going right
1373532 i suggested batten might have a little local cruise and sail with his mates i said if youre not ready dont go
1373533 the united states has no illusions about the regime in pyongyang
1373534 we remain deeply concerned about north koreas human rights abuses nuclear testing and proliferation ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose
1373535 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1373536 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1373537 roughly the equivalent of two decades of imported oil from saudi arabia
1373538 another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
1373539 it would take at least a decade for oil companies to obtain permits procure equipment and do the exploration necessary to get the oil out of the ground
1373540 who cares if more fossil fuels will contribute to the problems we should be committed to solving we just want gas prices to go down so we can win this election
1373541 this compromise must include budget reform that prevents our state from being in this position the governor is pushing republicans and democrats to come to the table immediately and reach a compromise because of the looming cash crisis we face
1373542 while i am frustrated that the legislature hasnt reached an agreement i am very encouraged that all four legislative leaders recognize the need to reform our broken budget system and as i have said before i will not sign a budget without substantive and long term budget reform the people elected me to bring sanity and stability to our states finances they wanted sacramento to end the reckless spending and to finally live within its means

1373579 after reviewing additional data and the public comments in the intervening year since the release of our draft documents on cloning we conclude that meat and milk from cattle swine and goat clones are as safe as the food we eat every day
1373580 the fda has acted recklessly and i am profoundly disappointed in their rush to approve cloned foods

1373712 nuestro equipo de nataci n siempre esta bajo presi n hist ricamente hemos ganado muchas medallas en nataci n y ello es lo que se espera de nuestros nadadores
1373713 lo que nosotros los australianos en general necesitamos es apreciar lo extraordinario que es nuestro equipo en este momento porque los ltimos a os han sido los mas exitosos de la historia de la nataci n de nuestro pa s
1373714 me han preguntado miles de veces si volver a a la nataci n y he estado pensando que deber a pero me siento feliz estando aqu como espectador
1373715 ese es un t tulo que es otorgado a nosotros por otros la otra parte de un campe n es algo diferente es un poco m s importante y representa humanidad
1373716 es nuestro deseo progresar como seres humanos para hacer cosas en forma diferente a otros y para poder establecer un nivel para las futuras generaciones

1373718 for many years now the self employed and manual workers have found it difficult if not impossible to source affordable income replacement polices that give them the cover they need or offers the speed of claims processing required and where getting back to work as soon as possible is a priority relying on speed of diagnosis and treatment by the nhs can be frustrating private medical insurance gives you instant access to treatment and the best chance of getting back to work and earning money without a delay
1373719 thanks to my policy i hope to be back to work soon and earning money again if you need your health and body in good condition to be able to earn money you should insure it after all i need my van for business so i insure it properly
1373720 with the alarming increase in the cost of living in recent months many households are having to review their current expenditure and look for areas where they can economise being forced to take extended periods of time off work at this time because of medical reasons only puts more pressure on an already stretched budget its important that we all look at our current financial arrangements a bit more creatively and really give some consideration to what we need to protect and whats important for many income protection is not an affordable or practical answer and the simple solution of being able to get back to work as soon as possible because your medical needs have been sorted can often help to resolve this issue pmi should certainly be considered in an individuals protection mix as a means of facilitating a swift return to work

1373756 rafael van der vaart s lo tiene 25 a os y desde los 17 juega en primera divisi n primero en el ajax y luego en el hamburgo ha ganado dos ligas una copa y una supercopa y es a decir de los t cnicos un jugador de extraordinaria calidad un medio defensivo que marca goles y que nos va a ayudar mucho esta temporada

1373986 looking at these two images i think people are just making the mistake of treating photographic representations as reality its understandable really we all are in the business of making people feel that photos are real but photographers take pictures at different exposures situations have different color balance and contrast and pictures can have varying levels of saturation on the left we have a photo that was processed or captured at a darker exposure and higher level of color saturation therefore his hair looks quite black but his skin tone is richer and deeper also his hair is also dark because he doesnt really have a hair light hes lit from the front gray hair is still clearly visible though it seems like a slightly warmer color temperature setting was used maybe 5200k on the right its a lighter exposure the color balance is a hair cooler so both his skin and hair are lighter the contrast is similar which is what fools your eye into thinking that the images are comparable lighting situations but they really arent hes lit more from the top and further hes tilting his head so the side of his head where you see a lot of hair is now better lit all the color that your eye processes as gray hair is mostly not gray hair but highlights from the lighting on his hair does he dye his hair i dont know but i certainly dont think hes dying it gray that would actually be difficult to do starting from black as a person who has double process hair myself i know from whence i speak at any rate i dont think a comparison of these images reveals that hes dying it gray

1374046 weve already decided before the game that both teams whoever wins regardless are going to split the prize money
1374047 i think were a little disappointed in the way that they advertised the tournament because us as players are definitely not getting the million dollars we want to show solidarity and that the players are united when we feel were not treated fairly we want to show that we stand together
1374048 i think we saw by the actions of the teams at the end of the games not the mls teams the other teams i think you could tell they dont enjoy seeing their northern neighbors catching up to the most important sport theyre very involved in

1374281 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1374282 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1374283 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1374284 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1374285 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1374286 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1374287 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center messier 87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster

1374318 i actually cant talk about it without talking about the game itself there are things related to story gameplay and i dont know how to describe it peoples relationship with the game over the long term thats what were thinking about but its about as clear as i can be
1374319 i think for us we come out of our bioshock coma from shipping that game and how hard that was and then making a determination whats next for us and how aggressive are we going to be do we want to do something a little more straightforward next time or do we want to swing for the fences again to paraphrase we decided to swing for the fences

1374490 the dna analysis are 100 percent so if the urine does not belong to the athlete then they certainly have a case to answer its a sad story
1374491 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1374492 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1374493 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1374494 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1374495 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1374496 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1374497 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1374498 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1374499 olympiakos is a major team a big club and i believe that it is very significant for my career to be a member of the team which will be playing in the
1374500 i believe im ready to help olympiakos and to follow my coachs orders i believe i will adjust to the team quickly
1374501 being here is great but this wasnt the real show
1374502 it was like an audition for the olympics we passed the pre olympic test but now were going to go and take care of business
1374503 this is rehearsal now were getting ready for the big game
1374504 i dont think there has every been a game when we played australia when it wasnt physical
1374505 ive been to three olympics games and this diamond ball is by far the best in terms of preparation
1374506 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1374507 this was a great tournament for us in terms of our preparation and i couldnt have asked for more
1374508 johnson wrote to us to say he considered the medal was not won honestly and he was returning it
1374509 youve got eight rounds four each in the 100 and 200 metres and ive got to go in there with my gloves on every round
1374510 that guys fast but i am going to be in the race
1374511 im not a favourite and that doesnt matter im never a favourite in my eyes in training
1374512 i know usain is the world record holder but ive got to look at tyson
1374513 he knows how to run those rounds and has run fast times at the end of those rounds
1374514 some times the fastest guy doesnt win but definitely the strongest always wins
1374515 im not making any predictions for the olympics im just going to do whatever helps the team
1374516 it just felt like i had a hard day in the training room
1374517 i didnt let it bother me i just blocked it out i just went after it like every other championship
1374518 if you are able to win at the trials you are able to win in the olympics
1374519 the college championships really helped my confidence showed that i had my speed back
1374520 ive been working on my starts staying low driving out and it seems to help
1374521 you have to be a pretty elite athlete to be in the same company with tiger woods
1374522 i wasnt training or anything and i got seventh that says a lot to me
1374523 my goal is to medal in beijing and bring home the hardware
1374524 i know i should medal if i dont i will be disappointed in myself its within reach in both events
1374525 this year i really learned how to plan out my races well
1374526 i just worked on my start and push off everything else comes natural lately everything has just come together so much better emotionally and physically
1374527 he wanted to include the arts pretty much from the start and this was all part of his vision
1374528 it was a nice idea to try and make out that everybody wasnt just a muddied oaf
1374529 in the opening ceremonies you have a lot of prescribed music the olympic hymn has to be sung and the national anthem of the host country
1374530 which champion gets the gold medal montserrat caballe again she demonstrates that she possesses one of the most beautiful voices ever to issue from a human throat
1374531 the opening ceremonies are more of ritual and the closing ceremonies are more of a going away party for the athletes you will see more popular music that the athletes can relate to
1374532 the referee will use the captain to a far greater degree
1374533 the captain will be the first and main point of contact for the referee during the game
1374534 football engages motivates and inspires but at times we know it can spill over and get ugly
1374535 the premier league our clubs the players and the referees are all engaged we want to make sure that this ends up being much more than a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1374536 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1374537 i thought our team just fought hard we werent going to be denied
1374538 but it is just rehearsal we feel good about the win but now its 0 0 and we would like to win it when it counts
1374539 i know a lot of people arent looking at me
1374540 the competitors who compete against me i dont think theyre overlooking me but i think a lot of the media is hyping the competition that allows me to maybe sneak in there and make things happen
1374541 i didnt sign because i didnt plan on getting injured and i still had work to do my thing was to make the team first the opportunity to make the olympic team comes around once in a lifetime and thats what i did
1374542 well hey thats called athletic sport theres been a lot of picks in a lot of venues where the underdog won and hes no underdog
1374543 during these two years at chelsea i had two operations and a serious back injury
1374544 if i will have the opportunity to train and play without injuries i would like to leave my mark on the history of chelsea injuries constantly kept me out of action
1374545 i have trained with the team only a week the process of recovery is taking place normally and the injury doesnt bother me
1374546 it is gratifying that the coach gave me an opportunity to get back to the rhythm of playing
1374547 we had a good conversation im only now getting into shape and recovering from injury so prefence is given to those players who are in better form
1374548 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme i very much respect scolari as a man and a great coach
1374549 i think the challenge for the coach now is to find the optimum team and help the players achieve their best form
1374550 it was a great game for us the last game before going into the olympic tournament we are happy that we played them and im sure they feel they got better from this
1374551 but at the end of the day we won the ball game and found a way to win
1374552 i think we made it a little hard on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much we did not make our outside shots tonight as well as we have done in the past
1374553 if i could name the three announcers for the tv broadcast they would be
1374554 if i could direct nascar to make amends to the fans who paid money to attend the allstate 400 at the brickyard i would make them
1374555 since the restrictions on internet access became clear in late july authorities have restored access to numerous sites this is a very welcome step toward greater openness

1374557 we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of the organization

1374675 psychopaths are social predators who charm manipulate and ruthlessly plow their way through life leaving a broad trail of broken hearts shattered expectations and empty wallets completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others they selfishly take what they want and do as they please

1374677 and worst of all i cant stop obsessing over david i thought i was over him but its all coming up again
1374678 then give it six more just keep throwin six months at it till it goes away stuff like this takes time
1374679 listen to me someday youre gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving youll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken but your life was changing and you were in the best possible place in the world for it in a beautiful place of worship surrounded by grace take this time every minute of it let things work themselves out here in india
1374680 big deal so you fell in love with someone dont you see what happened this guy touched a place in your heart deeper than you thought you were capable of reaching i mean you got zapped kiddo but that love you felt thats just the beginning you just got a taste of love thats just limited little rinky dink mortal love wait till you see how much more deeply you can love than that heck groceries you have the capacity to someday love the whole world its your destiny dont laugh
1374681 and please dont laugh at me now but i think the reason its so hard for me to get over this guy is because i seriously believed david was my soul mate
1374682 he probably was your problem is you dont understand what that word means people think a soul mate is your perfect fit and thats what everyone wants but a true soul mate is a mirror the person who shows you everything thats holding you back the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life a true soul mate is probably the most important person youll ever meet because they tear down your walls and smack you awake but to live with a soul mate forever nah too painful soul mates they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you and then they leave and thank god for it your problem is you just cant let this one go its over groceries davids purpose was to shake you up drive you out of that marriage that you needed to leave tear apart your ego a little bit show you your obstacles and addictions break your heart open so new light could get in make you so desperate and out of control that you had to transform your life then introduce you to your spiritual master and his job and he did great but now its over problem is you cant accept that this relationship had a real short shelf life youre like a dog at the dump baby youre just lickin at an empty tin can trying to get more nutrition out of it and if youre not careful that cans gonna get stuck on your snout forever and make your life miserable so drop it
1374683 so miss him send him some love and light every time you think about him and then drop it youre just afraid to let go of the last bits of david because then youll really be alone and liz gilbert is scared to death of what will happen if shes really alone but heres what you gotta understand groceries if you clear out all that space in your mind that youre using right now to obsess about this guy youll hav ea vacuum there an open spot a doorway and guess what the universe will do with that doorway it will rush in god will rush in and fill you with more love than you ever dreamed so stop using david to block that door let it go
1374684 see now thats your problem youre wishin too much baby you gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be
1374685 so how long will it be before all this grieving passes
1374686 lemme tell you something groceries you got some serious control issues
1374687 you have got control issues groceries come on nobody every told you this before
1374688 ok i think youre probably right maybe i do have a problem with control its just weird that you noticed because i dont think its that obvious on the surface i mean i bet most people cant see my control issues when they first look at me
1374689 they cant honey ray charles could see your control issues
1374690 ok i think im done with this conversation now thank you
1374691 you gotta learn how to let go groceries otherwise youre gonna make yourself sick never gonna have a good nights sleep again youll just toss and turn forever beatin on yourself for being such a fiasco in life whats wrong with me how come i screw up all my relationships why am i such a failure lemme guess thats probably what you were up at atll hours doin to yourself again last night

1374934 yet again we were witness to some very good darts
1374935 the three things my dad used to speak about on his rounds were football cricket and his grandchildren
1374936 daniel was the footballer kallum was the cricketer and young connor who is only two years old was the natterer
1374937 unfortunately my dad never met jessica the youngest of the four grandchildren
1374938 daniel isnt playing for a team at the moment so we thought it would be fitting to raise some money for the darwen cricket club juniors and supply shirts for the under 15s team which kallum plays for
1374939 my dad loved his cricket and although i dont think he played for darwen he used to like going to watch kallum play
1374940 he was very popular in the town and always had a word for everyone
1374941 i think that is why he took so long to complete his round
1374942 les would have been very proud as he was one of the best players ive seen
1374943 hes entered and won the competition a number of times so it was fitting that we held a competition in his honour
1374944 there were some great darts played on the night and daves 12 dart checkout just proved the point
1374945 the event has become more and more popular and that is all down to his hard work i would also like to thank the pioneer club as well for its continued support and for also donating the trophy and prize money

1374998 ni yulan is a courageous activist whose only crime has been to defend her rights and the rights of victims of forced evictions in beijing
1374999 to try her on the eve of the games is an extraordinary insult to those who lost their homes to the beijing olympics and shows contempt for human rights concerns raised by the international community
1375000 she was in a very bad condition she could hardly walk she was very very weak and deathly pale
1375001 nis case shows the price that ordinary people pay in chinas
1375002 if george bush nicholas sarkozy gordon brown and other world leaders attending the games fail to publicly call on the chinese leadership to release ni yulan and the hundreds of other courageous government critics now languishing in prison they will in effect have endorsed these gross abuses

1375033 pelosi s gambit rests on one big assumption that democrats will own washington after the election and will be able to craft a sweeping energy policy that is heavy on conservation and fuel alternatives while allowing for some new oil drilling democrats see no need to make major concessions on energy policy with a party poised to lose seats in both chambers in just three months even if recess averse republicans continue to pound away on the issue

1375051 we were in tampa a couple of years back and it was the night trot nixon got hurt and we had an off day the next day and
1375052 manny was supposed to have an off day and he was asked to fill in for trot because we had nobody to play and he didnt and we were in the clubhouse and it was david ortiz and manny and i and ino guerrero and the seth mcclung was pitching and he was one of those guys who threw 96 miles per hour and no one could ever figure out why he wasnt better than he was and against us hed always go out the first three innings and look like cy young of course this night hes looking like cy young he punched out five or six guys in the first three innings and david looks at me and says why in the hell does this guy turn into cy young against us and i said hey it just makes manny look that much smarter he aint stupid he knows what days to take off and manny took offense to that and there was something that had to be broken up and the next day i saw manny and it was as if the previous day never happened one of the beautiful things about manny
1375053 you kind of hope it didnt happen because it ends up being someone getting what they wanted after doing every possible thing ethically they could do wrong
1375054 i was in that clubhouse after that and the change in atmosphere was palpable and i dont think you can put a price tag on that

1375066 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him he was a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

1375080 prepare your elevator pitch before you record here is an example
1375081 contrary to its name a video resume is not a resume its a 30 to 60 second ad spot to entice your viewers to look at your digital r sum and find out more about you
1375082 put it on paper first think of what you want to say about yourself write it down in short sentences and then say it aloud replace any syntax problems or phrases that are hard to enunciate with simpler words you speak differently than you write so keep it in a conversational tone as if you were speaking to your real life interviewer a few feet away
1375083 dont wing it your finished product should be compelling this is the most professional image you want to present so prepare ahead of time and memorize your script
1375084 remember a video r sum is a type of interview so dress the part give the appearance of someone in the role for which you are applying you will also have some background showing on the video make sure its not your dirty laundry or the clutter of your bedroom

1375093 one of the things that we forget because it seems new to us again with dean and obama is the importance of small funders
1375094 if you look for example at carters 1976 campaign and reagans 1980 campaign you see campaigns that are very much built off of small contributions of 500 or below
1375095 i was a skeptic about the effectiveness of the internet
1375096 in the past the money from small contributions typically has been too little too late now you could almost manage a campaign off of these small internet driven contributions they are a major source of revenue
1375097 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use

1375099 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1375100 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1375101 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant

1375120 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1375121 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1375122 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp

1375278 the government should not be trying to bribe people into buying homes in a falling market
1375279 with the economy grinding to a halt we are likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make the situation worse
1375280 the falls we are seeing in the housing market are painful if necessary if homes are to become affordable for those not on the property ladder
1375281 if it helps to kick start some activity in our moribund housing market
1375282 the government needs to think more strategically about reforming stamp duty so that it better supports people moving and encourages institutions to invest in housing supply
1375283 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1375284 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1375285 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems

1375322 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1375323 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1375324 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1375325 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1375326 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1375327 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1375328 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1375329 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1375330 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1375331 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1375332 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1375333 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1375334 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1375335 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1375336 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1375337 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1375338 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1375339 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1375340 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1375341 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1375342 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1375343 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1375344 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1375345 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1375346 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1375347 all these 19 million people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport
1375348 the bbc is astonished at the comments from the ecb
1375349 we have always said that any bid for live test cricket is subject to value for money and ability to schedule in our view neither of these criteria were met
1375350 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of reach of all terrestrial broadcasters this is the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it it is absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1375351 a bidder may bid for part only of any package eg two test matches or whatever taking place in each season however any such bid must be for the full duration of the contract
1375352 we had countless meetings with broadcasters and i am convinced that we now have achieved the best deal available to cricket from those companies who expressed an interest in the rights
1375353 our citizenry would rather leave it to us but were going to have to ask them to pay higher taxes and extra fines and cunning charges thats the only way the budgets will balance
1375354 kebijakan globalisasi ekonomi sebagaimana dijalankan oleh bank dunia imf dan wto sesungguhnya jauh lebih banyak menciptakan kemiskinan ketimbang memberikan jalan keluar the international forum on globalization 2004 8 pada dasarnya globalisasi yang dimotori as merupakan proses menjadikan sistem ekonomi kapitalis ala amerika serikat sebagai sistem dominan di dunia dengan mengintegrasikan perekonomian lokal ke dalam tatanan perekonomian global melalui privatisasi pasar bebas dan mekanisme pasar pada semua perekomian negara negara di dunia ini berarti penghapusan semua batasan dan hambatan terhadap arus perpindahan barang modal dan jasa yang bersandar pada kekuatan pengaruh amerika serikat wto bank dunia dan imf tiada lain hanyalah alat untuk memaksakan kekuatan amerika serikat itu atas nama pasar bebas wto afta apec bank dunia imf negeri negeri muslim dipaksa membuka keran privatisasi yang luar biasa termasuk dengan menjual asset asset publik mereka kepada swasta asing baik dengan alasan untuk membayar utang maupun agar kompatibel dengan aturan aturan internasional di indonesia lembaga lembaga kreditor internasional tersebut melalui berbagai skema pinjaman luar negeri memainkan peran penting mendorong agenda privatisasi melalui keluarnya berbagai produk regulasi seperti uu sumber daya air uu migas uu penanaman modal hingga privatisasi bumn hasilnya saat ini investasi sektor minyak dan gas bumi misalnya sebanyak 85 4 persen dari 137 konsesi pengelolaan lapangan minyak dan gas bumi migas di indonesia dimiliki oleh perusahaan asing ini merupakan fakta bahwa penjajahan atau imperialisme merupakan metode baku peran politik internasional sebuah negara sangat dipengaruhi oleh kekuataan negara tersebut negara yang lemah pasti tidak memiliki peran yang penting dalam konstelasi internasional negara itu hanya menjadi pengekor atau bahkan ditindas oleh negara yang kuat faktor utama yang membuat sebuah negara kuat adalah ideologi mabda nya tanpa ideologi atau menjadi pengikut ideologi asing sebuah negara akan menjadi lemah faktanya semua negara adidaya atau yang pernah menjadi negara adidaya pasti merupakan negara yang dibangun di atas satu ideologi tertentu misalnya uni sovyet sebelum runtuh dengan ideologi sosialisme komunisnya as dengan ideologi kapitalisme sekularnya dan khilafah islamiyah pada masa lalu dengan ideologi islamnya ideologi adalah faktor utama yang membuat sebuah negara menjadi kuat sehingga mampu berperan secara dominan dalam percaturan politik internasional sementara negara negara muslim saat ini justru meninggalkan islam sebagai ideologi sehingga secara ekonomi dan politik mereka di bawah hegemoni baca jajahan as dan sekutunya karena itu untuk kembali berperan dalam konstelasi internasional serta membebaskan diri dari penjajahan militer politik dan ekonomi maka umat islam harus kembali menegakkan khilafah islamiyah yang menjadikan islam sebagai ideologi sekaligus dasar negaranya negara semacam inilah yang akan menerapkan hukum islam mengemban ideologi islam ke seluruh dunia dan bahkan menjadi satu satunya negara adidaya di dunia tidak hanya ideologi islam umat islam juga memiliki sumber sumber kekuataan yang bisa mendukung terwujudnya khilafah islamiyah sebagai negara adidaya dunia jika seluruh wilayah kaum muslim di dunia bersatu di bawah naungan khilafah islamiyah mereka akan memiliki posisi geografis yang sangat menguntungkan sebagai negara adidaya kaum muslim secara geografis menempati posisi yang strategis pada jalur laut dunia mereka mengendalikan selat gibraltar di mediterania barat terusan suez di mediterania timur selat balb al mandab yang memiliki teluk teluk kecil di laut merah selat dardanelles dan bosphorus yang menghubungkan jalur laut hitam ke mediterania serta selat hormus di teluk selat malaka merupakan lokasi strategis di timur jauh dengan menempati posisi yang strategis ini kebutuhan masyarakat internasional akan wilayah kaum muslim pastilah tinggi mengingat mereka harus melewati jalur laut strategis tersebut di samping itu mereka akan sulit menaklukkan negeri negeri islam karena pintu pintu strategis laut dikuasai oleh kaum muslim faktor sumberdaya alam negeri negeri islam dianugerahi oleh allah swt sebagai negeri negeri yang kaya raya dengan sumberdaya alamnya contohnya adalah kekayaan sumber pangan negara yang memiliki sumber pangan yang besar jelas akan memperkuat posisi negara tersebut karena akan terhindar dari ketergantungan pada negara lain negeri negeri islam dikenal sebagai wilayah yang subur untuk bercocok tanam pangan sumberdaya alam lainnya yang penting adalah bahan mentah saat ini dunia islam mengendalikan cadangan minyak dunia 60 boron 40 fosfat 50 perlite 60 strontium 27 dan tin 22 dengan potensi ideologis dan faktor faktor penunjang tersebut khilafah islam jelas akan menjadi sebuah negara adidaya yang sangat kuat di sinilah letak pentingnya kaum muslim menegakkan khilafah islam tersebut di tengah tengah mereka ketidakadaan khilafah islam yang berdasarkan ideologi islam membuat kaum muslim mundur dalam peran internasionalnya bahkan tidak mampu menghadapi penjajahan barat bagaimanapun barat dengan kekuatan negaranya yang dibangun atas dasar ideologi kapitalisme yang mengglobal juga harus dilawan dengan kekuatan negara yang dibangun di atas ideologi yang juga mengglobal negara tersebut adalah khilafah islam yang akan menghimpun potensi kaum muslim dan menyatukan dunia islam secara ril karenanya hanya melalui khilafah islam inilah umat islam akan mampu memayungi dunia dengan segala kebaikannya melalui penerapan yang membawa rahmat bagi seluruh umat manusia sekaligus mengakhiri imperialisme as dan sekutunya yang membawa bencana dan kesengsaraan umat manusia melalui penerapan kapitalisme sekulernya maha benar allah yang telah berfirman tiadalah kami mengutus kamu muhammad melainkan untuk menjadi rahmat bagi semesta alam
1375355 doordat er heel wat reactie kwam op het vervroegen van de traditionele datum zal u in augustus twee weekends de kans krijgen om uw klanten te bekoren
1375356 de meningen van u als handelaar over de data waren verdeeld sommigen vinden een vroege braderie beter omdat dan sneller kan uitgepakt worden met de herfstartikelen anderen kiezen echter voor de gebruikelijke datum omdat dit de verkoop nog een weekend extra stimuleert met bovenvermelde oplossing hopen we iedereen dit jaar te kunnen plezieren in de toekomst zal na overleg waarschijnlijk wel weer voor een vaste datum gekozen worden dit zal mede beslist worden aan de hand van het succes aldus nog voorzitter ann vervarcke

1375359 the size of the infarct is one of the most important predictors of long term left ventricular function in patients with an acute myocardial infarction
1375360 imaging of myocardial infarct size is difficult in the emergency setting as the current gold standard methods of delayed enhanced mri and nuclear medicine techniques are difficult to perform in unstable patients ct is very easy and quick to perform even at the acute phase so we wanted to find out if it can do the same job as mri and potentially provide further information
1375361 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1375362 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1375363 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1375364 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1375365 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1375366 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1375367 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1375368 our findings suggest that prevention of subclinical infarcts and white matter abnormalities may be one mechanism whereby fish or omega 3 fatty acid consumption may decrease the development of these debilitating conditions
1375369 our results support the need for randomized trials of fish or fish oil intake to reduce subclinical ischemic events which would be feasible and important given the high incidence of such events in older adults
1375370 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1375371 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
1375372 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
1375373 she got the job because she blitzed her screen test i mean i had no idea she was so good
1375374 she walked into our office in sydney and read the part she has done some italian movies but i didnt think she would be as good as she was
1375375 but once she read we all looked around at each other and said well theres no question
1375376 what we are doing now is using a project folder called mileage log and instead of recording time we record miles as a manager it is easier for me to generate reports per person and date range and attach those to the accounting department for reimbursement purposes
1375377 for me the cornerstone of project management isn t a gantt chart or a risk register but lists in basecamp i find the ability to create and maintain all the lists that i need to keep track of my barn conversion it also provides you with the ability to share files text and messages and track time amp tasks with other members of a project team the emphasis is on project collaboration and communication
1375378 our wedding was an informal affair at a beach side kiosk location in south australia to co ordinate people involved in the event friends and family mostly we used this backpack public page it worked wonderfully well and the day was a huge success

1375382 i like to think people have good intentions are are forewarning me of a speed trap but then i remember hearing about an involving gang initiation so i try not to flash anyone just to be on the safe side
1375383 the failure of the global fund for aids tuberculosis and malaria pepfar the u s presidents emergency plan for aids relief the world bank and the worlds other global health bodies to devote significant resources toward reducing hiv rates among msm is indefensible
1375384 these organizations have policies on women drug users migration but not one of them has a comprehensive policy on msm
1375385 we talk to them for at least an hour each time but that may not change their behavior these are clients who have undergone repeated tests and we find that they are still engaging in unsafe sexual behaviour
1375386 they would say they were approached unexpectedly and did not happen to have condoms with them
1375387 if you heat metal up the heat encourages the corrosion on the bullet
1375388 the same could be said for bombs wherever they may be from
1375389 we have been contacted by the us military as to its potential to find fingerprints on fragments of explosive devices
1375390 you could have a fingerprint put on metal of a bomb that goes off
1375391 the heat is generated that can enhance the corrosion of the metal
1375392 we have discussed using this technique on recovered fragments of bombs then finding prints of people who have handled the device before its manufactured
1375393 in our opinion the science could work just as well on fragments of a bomb as it does on bullets

1375425 were making really good progress with the government and the entire higher education sector in our strategy to confront the problem
1375426 ujs and jewish students had a fantastic year with key political victories across the country and we are confident that these will play a vital role in firmly tackling antisemitic incidents over the next year
1375427 at the national union of students conference this year we set the precedent of how we expect antisemitism to be dealt with when an organisation handing out antisemitic material was removed and banned the stance taken by the nus should be an example to the rest of the higher education sector
1375428 the most effective way of dealing with antisemitism is for jewish students to be empowered through strong and united local jewish societies and a strong national union we can continue the good work already taking place in dealing with antisemitism
1375429 every antisemitic attack is a blight on society the 2008 interim report figures show that reporting is better
1375430 the work that cst and ujs have done together is excellent by knowing the scale of the problem we can deploy strategies to combat antisemitism on our streets and our campuses

1375482 people in the west have acquired considerable skill in using interpreting and manipulating law even though laws tend to be too complicated for an average person to understand without the help of an expert it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defence against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organised legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil

1375504 you have a lot of weapons and a lot of support
1375505 my job is just to manage everything ive got great talent around me then the coaches tell me how to do it and i just have to do it i just have to manage the rest of the team get the ball to the right people and let them do what they do best
1375506 like i have a lot i need to work on im just out here trying to do my best i feel like its a privilege just to be on the team i want to do whatever i can just to help out

1375531 im a band widow my dh is involved in two bands both practice once to twice per week we have been married for almost a year and have a two month old baby as well as an eight year old from a previous relationship of mine dh and i have several arguments over who is the most tired he works a very physical job and handles a lot of the physical things around the house because i have a back injury i had hyperemesis through the pregnancy and midway through he decided we should also start our own business so a home business two bands work and being a caregiver as well as parent husband etc and i think dh is a little over loaded when we finally ever get time to ourselves were both usually exhausted and spend the time sleeping on the couch watching movies for me it went from hyperemesis to colic and dealing with a very sore back we went on vacation and i really wanted dh to have some fun down time so i arranged for that to happen just as he was about to leave the campsite to have some fun i felt super resentful and tired and worn out theres another blog topic camping with a seven week old baby at an outdoor music festival he didnt get angry but i know he was resentful that i had promised this fun time and ended up pulling him back into the tent to watch us sleep and keep me company i dont know if i should feel bad about being like this im glad dh has a life and interests and its why i fell in love with him over the past year ive lost my life almost entirely beyond making sure this baby is healthy and happy i know hes worked hard to support us though the problem is i wouldnt know what to do with myself if i did have time off my energy is still zapped from pregnancy and after breast feeding and soothing a colicky baby for 1 3 of the day i dont think a night on the town would last much more than an hour this too shall pass is my mantra but im pretty sure that beyond the colic and the back injury and the rest of it ill still be a band extra curricular widow
1375532 the path is clear you need to figure out how to get connected again its my guess that the couples who maintain connection assuming they had it in the first place are able to share the misery instead of compete with it which means that theyre a admitting to themselves that its hard and theyre stressed and they cant really do things like say camping at this point in their lives although you will camp again b admitting to each other that theyre at the limit of their capacity c acknowledging whatever feelings the other one expresses as valid and earned and d giving each other the benefit of the doubt

1375542 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
1375543 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
1375544 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
1375545 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music
1375546 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
1375547 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names

1375561 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1375562 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1375563 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1375564 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1375565 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1375566 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1375567 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people

1375592 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1375593 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1375594 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1375595 there has definitely been an increase in the volume of harassment and now weve seen an increase in the stakes of the violence that theyre willing to spread in the name of this cause
1375596 but as far as who did it and whether theyre the same people thats something that only time and investigation will determine
1375597 we do have some viable leads that were working on
1375598 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing
1375599 this behavior is antithetical to the core principles of the humane movement
1375600 if animal abusers arent going to stop perpetrating these types of atrocities they ought to be stopped using whatever means necessary what were starting to see is the implementation of that type of strategy

1375668 we have lost an important figure in our dance community and a wonderfully beautiful and charming lady
1375669 i was tall and was considered far too ungainly to be a dancer but valrene was very talented right from the start
1375670 at 15 she was certainly considered very young to be travelling
1375671 she never wanted to pry into peoples private lives she just accepted them and loved them for who they were
1375672 to have that vision and commitment to advance australian dance with no funding is just incredible
1375673 awaking on friday morning june 20 1913 the south african native found himself not actually a slave but a pariah in the land of his birth
1375674 it left me thinking i would be hard pressed to come up with a list of 10 books that carry a sense of south african ness there are whispers of it in jm coetzees early work and in patricia skyline fred khumalos bitches brew and phaswane mpes welcome to my hillbow but a few titles do not a canon make
1375675 south african writing is flourishing with more novels being published than ever before and yet having followed its rise i cant help feeling disappointed in its
1375676 came after that and no other country has had the same pattern as us think of magic realisms roots with latin america and soon there will be a title that unites us making people who like titles happy so that we can all be disseminated and taught back to each other in the future

1375702 i feel so angry iraqis are also human beings why do we have such different lives
1375703 the sentence is clearly not robust enough for the crime and the failure to provide a package of care completely inappropriate
1375704 you were found guilty of the culpable homicide of your wife who you were together with for many years
1375705 in normal circumstances this would attract a prison sentence in double figures
1375706 i have read and considered a number of reports from experts it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition
1375707 sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty
1375708 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives
1375709 not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1375710 this is clearly a very difficult case in which there has been a mental illness involved
1375711 however the real issue here is that the sentence has not been robust enough to protect the public from him doing anything similar again
1375712 there has been no effort to provide any kind of appropriate care package to deal with this mans mental health condition
1375713 a restriction of liberty order is clearly inappropriate in a case as serious as this
1375714 its a quite shocking sentence for a crime like this
1375715 there are obviously a lot of people with dementia who are being treated in prison although we dont know how serious his condition is
1375716 the whole issue of the provision of care for dementia sufferers needs to be looked at in the light of this case as there would clearly be issues if he was to be treated in a care home
1375717 im not entirely sure what the best sentence for this individual would be but its certainly not appropriate for him to receive a restriction of liberty order
1375718 the report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline
1375719 there is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in it is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 hour care
1375720 i am deeply conscious there has been a death here but this man is very unwell
1375721 he was always willing to plead guilty to culpable homicide but this was flatly rejected by the crown and that is why a trial was necessary

1375823 our indoor and outdoor adaptive wireless lans have drawn considerable interest from prospective domestic and international users with high security requirements for whom fips 140 2 validation by itself is insufficient
1375824 these users require a combination of common criteria certification fips 140 2 validation and directive 8100 2 compliance with these in hand we can bring the same mobility and efficiency benefits to high security users as we do to general enterprise customers
1375825 we are unique in that we provide firewall incapability directly in the mobility control software so that every user and the application software that they use is self contained in its own logical partition on the wireless network and on the network itself
1375826 thats unlike traditional access points or traditional wireless networks were all traffic is co mingled and theres no differentiation from one user to another
1375827 all his work toward us is love and mercy kindheartedness if we do not experience this love and mercy it is because we draw back we refuse it or our own distortions of god distort our experience of his love it is because whether from fear or hurt we hold back distrustful misreading his heart and his motives the pain of our encounter with god is not from the outflowing of his love but due to the sin and fear and distrust we still wish to hold on to all things that god does for us are love and mercy and kindness

1375829 exxon mobil today broke its own record for the highest ever profit by a u s company with net income this quarter rising to 11 68 billion while exxon officials regularly tout the companys investment in alternative energy
1375830 like george bush and dick cheney before him obama said of the arizonan he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long
1375831 how out of touch is barack obama hes so out of touch that he suggested that if all americans inflated their tires properly and took their cars for regular tune ups they could save as much oil as new offshore drilling would produce gleeful republicans have made this their daily talking point rush limbaugh is having a field day and the republican national committee is sending tire gauges labeled barack obamas energy plan to washington reporters

1375873 now is the time and the time is now lets talk about windows service pack 1 sp1
1375874 much has been made of what will or will not be included in sp1 and when it will be released some accurate some otherwise
1375875 im here to set the story straight were in the process of developing and deploying a beta version of sp1
1375876 it would have been nice if it could have been available for the 11 30 enterprise availability anniversary
1375877 regardless of whether this is justified or not experience tells desktop managers to not deploy a new windows operating system until sp1
1375878 a few major software vendors have been somewhat sluggish to get their enterprise class applications certified for vista
1375879 so what good is a new os if for example the vpn connection doesnt work for remote access or the antivirus software cant run
1375880 sp1 is technically important because it will add support for emerging technologies devices and standards and will address some early end user feedback but its also symbolically significant for enterprises that have temporarily held off evaluating or deploying vista
1375881 after sp1 starts shipping by the major oems in q1 i expect full scale enterprise adoption to really kick off in mid 2008 in line with the natural pc refresh cycle of enterprises
1375882 wu makes service packs less important because many important updates will be available long before the sp
1375883 but sps are still important because they mark when the clock starts ticking for the end of support of the previous sp
1375884 most organizations will still need a few months to test the sp and integrate it into the process

1375904 ive always wanted to sail to the south seas but i cant afford it what these people cant afford is not to go they are enmeshed in the demands of security and in the worship of security we fling our lives beneath the wheels of routine and before we know it our lives are gone
1375905 what does a person need really need a few pounds of food each day heat and shelter six feet to lie down in and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment
1375906 the years thunder by the dreams of youth grow dim while they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience before we sense it the tomb is sealed
1375907 i like to take shapes that alone dont carry any emotional feeling but by their intersecting of each other start to talk to us emotionally
1375908 for me its really analogous to music the composer doesnt invent notes theyre all there on the piano its the repetition of the notes and their relationship with each other that makes the difference between something thats noise and banal and something thats profound and moving i want you to see these penetrations because there are wonderful secondary shapes that happen i think of them like chords in music
1375909 before the last 10 years we would have never seen so many animals coming up in the gulf stream
1375910 we think its correlated with the generally warmer temperatures we are experiencing

1375942 the antikythera mechanism is a unique greek geared device constructed around the end of the second century bc
1375943 its specific functions have remained controversial because its gears and the inscriptions upon its faces are only fragmentary here we report surface imaging and high resolution x ray tomography of the surviving fragments enabling us to reconstruct the gear function and double the number of deciphered inscriptions the mechanism predicted lunar and solar eclipses on the basis of babylonian arithmetic progression cycles the inscriptions support suggestions of mechanical display of planetary positions now lost in the second century bc hipparchos developed a theory to explain the irregularities of the moons motion across the sky caused by its elliptic orbit we find a mechanical realization of this theory in the gearing of the mechanism revealing an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period
1375944 dr freeth who is also associated with images first ltd in london explained in an e mail message that the metonic calendar was designed to reconcile the lengths of the lunar month with the solar year twelve lunar months are about 11 days short of a year but 235 lunar months fit well into 19 years

1375957 during these two years at chelsea i had two operations and a serious back injury

1375959 i have trained with the team only a week the process of recovery is taking place normally and the injury doesnt bother me
1375960 it is gratifying that the coach gave me an opportunity to get back to the rhythm of playing
1375961 we had a good conversation im only now getting into shape and recovering from injury so prefence is given to those players who are in better form
1375962 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme i very much respect scolari as a man and a great coach
1375963 i think the challenge for the coach now is to find the optimum team and help the players achieve their best form

1376047 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1376048 the governments decision to inject extra capital into northern rock means that uk taxpayers will become shareholders in a troubled mortgage lender during what looks set to be the severest downturn in the housing market for decades
1376049 the government might ultimately need to inject much more capital into northern rock putting further pressure on the public finances and further increasing the exposure of uk taxpayers

1376064 in addition the web based casual game industry has shown tremendous growth as an early mover in this segment we believe that ultizen will become a dominant player and moreover have great potential to expand from a developer into an influential publishing and operating company in this segment

1376091 tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed
1376092 in a significant proportion of cases they have not needed to be fired drawing or aiming the taser has been enough of a deterrent
1376093 while the deployment of tasers is and should be an operational matter for the police these figures highlight the increasingly violent situations our police are facing every day
1376094 it also reinforces the need to properly monitor the use of this relatively new technology as it is more widely used

1376156 the government should not be trying to bribe people into buying homes in a falling market
1376157 with the economy grinding to a halt we are likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make the situation worse
1376158 the falls we are seeing in the housing market are painful if necessary if homes are to become affordable for those not on the property ladder
1376159 if it helps to kick start some activity in our moribund housing market
1376160 the government needs to think more strategically about reforming stamp duty so that it better supports people moving and encourages institutions to invest in housing supply
1376161 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1376162 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1376163 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems

1376353 the process of israeli american contacts on the matter did not cease and more specific information was provided
1376354 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1376355 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1376356 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1376357 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1376358 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1376359 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1376360 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1376361 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1376362 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1376363 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1376364 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1376365 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1376366 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1376367 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1376368 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1376369 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1376370 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1376371 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1376372 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1376373 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1376374 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1376375 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1376376 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1376377 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1376378 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1376379 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1376380 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
1376381 the anthrax attack was a classic false flag operation targeting arabs
1376382 to hell with it forget why we are there we just need to win

1376386 dear friends do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though something strange were happening to you but rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed
1376387 i plead with euodia and i plead with syntyche to agree with each other in the lord yes and i ask you loyal yokefellow help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel along with clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life

1376391 let your gentleness be evident to all the lord is near
1376392 gentle toleration for others in spite of having justification for intolerance
1376393 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
1376394 but its not easy and you dont know what i am going through
1376395 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god
1376396 that the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
1376397 i have come that you might have life and life more abundantly
1376398 the only way to achieve real freedom from the effects of a dishonoring parent is to honor that person

1376400 i have given them your word and the world has hated them for any more than i am of the world
1376401 we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time not only so but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies
1376402 now we are children of god and what we will be has not yet been made known but we know that when he appears for we shall see him as he is everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure
1376403 but you dont really know anything about willa mrs renling
1376404 my dear boy you talk like a nitwit go on with her if you want im not your mother but youll see
1376405 when she has you roped dyou think all she wants out of life is to wait on tables and work to feed herself just to keep in shape for you so youll have nothing to do but enjoy her you know nothing about girls girls want to marry and its not in the modest old times when they sat on it till somebody would have mercy

1376407 the exact technique used by the humans to obtain these reptiles is uncertain based on the data available
1376408 but it does appear they used systematic patterns to process them including cooking them fracturing the shell and defleshing them for consumption
1376409 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1376410 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1376411 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1376412 it was an incredible moment when we realised the figures we were getting in
1376413 they had not been previously recorded because these are very remote areas that are quite inaccessible and logistically tough to survey
1376414 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1376415 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

1376420 it is important to encourage the kids to carry on learning and to explore their own marine environment and the experience lasts a lifetime
1376421 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding
1376422 a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood
1376423 this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1376424 this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk
1376425 around 45 000 norwich union customers were affected by the floods in 2007

1376427 it was a nice idea to try and make out that everybody wasnt just a muddied oaf
1376428 in the opening ceremonies you have a lot of prescribed music the olympic hymn has to be sung and the national anthem of the host country
1376429 the opening ceremonies are more of ritual and the closing ceremonies are more of a going away party for the athletes you will see more popular music that the athletes can relate to
1376430 we have more than a billion people so i think we can say it will be the biggest olympic cultural festival ever

1376436 as a stockholder i was curious which of my proxy letters actually was counted i received four one was from icahn the other three were from yahoo the last of which arrived today august 4th does this strike anyone as odd

1376454 as you made clear in your letter events around the world make a code of conduct not just ideal but essential as companies and others work to ensure the protection of basic human rights for citizens for citizens across the globe
1376455 committed to seeing this effort through to a successful conclusion as swiftly as possible
1376456 google has established a strong track record of filtering less and providing more transparency than any other search engine in china
1376457 where appropriate we direct foreign governments seeking access to such data to follow international agreements that require established government to government procedures
1376458 microsoft also applies internal risk assessment procedures aimed at protecting user privacy
1376459 this code of conduct would be one important step toward our shared goals of promoting freedom of expression and protecting the privacy of internet users around the world
1376460 always aim high work hard and care deeply about what you believe in when you stumble keep faith when youre knocked down get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you cant or shouldnt go on
1376461 a fost ridicol absolut ridicol ceea ce s a intamplat atunci
1376462 fata noastra era in romania si ne intrebam ce se va intampla cu ea puteam sa ne intoarcem si sa infruntam consecintele ceea ce insemna sa fim bagati la inchisoare sau sa ne luam viata in propriile maini stiind ca avem un viitor sumbru
1376463 in ziua aia a fost impuscat presedintele reagan si liniile telefonice fie erau ocupate fie ascultate iar securitatea stia ca nu ne am intors
1376464 aveam nopti cand ne intrebam cum o sa scapam din acest cosmar
1376465 cand am fugit din romania am fost acuzati ca am atentat la siguranta sistemului comunist
1376466 in noaptea aceea cand am ajuns in romania nu am putut deloc sa dorm

1376474 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1376475 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1376476 despite the mccain campaigns effectiveness however the best campaign against barack obama is not being run by his opponent but by barack obama this is the trap barack obama has made for himself the one he cannot escape the one hillary clinton foresaw the one that may doom him the obama campaign knows it too in fear the dream is being lost drop by drop they are going negative on john mccain

1376480 but we thought we had a good shot the one advantage we had was that we had done work on the salt lake city games plus we had an office in beijing but if i recall correctly there were more than 100 law firms that wanted to do this work on the international side our competitors were from the united states the united kingdom china and hong kong
1376481 im probably going to be at the games but im not sure
1376482 if im required to be there ill be there but my work is realted to the preparation of the games

1376493 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1376494 but that may not be the end of our approach to competition policy in the sector if we think that its not competitive enough
1376495 economic growth is slowing but on the other hand we still have in parts of the country labour shortages and skills shortages as well
1376496 wayne swan and kevin rudd have spent every day since the election talking up inflation and talking down the economy this is the slowdown kevin rudd and wayne swan wanted us to have
1376497 we wont get a one off retracing of what the banks have done

1376505 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1376506 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1376507 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1376508 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1376509 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1376510 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1376511 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab
1376512 for me whats paramount is writing from a truthful place
1376513 now im finding this extreme sense of urgency to cut to the core to get to the truth it strikes me that theres a real lack of protest songwriters out there what a real opportunity this is to write about what all of us are feeling collectively to serve the role artists have served historically
1376514 a wholly inspired creative environment for me a very prolific time
1376515 not to sound too harsh but with this record im not concerned who im going to lose or pick up
1376516 because everything felt more urgent the environment a war based on deception and in general across the board people in america have become comatose or dulled out by the immense amount of information thats out there i had to take a leap of faith that a lot of people are feeling the way im feeling
1376517 it feels bigger and grander and goes to a more dramatic place
1376518 im really enjoying playing the new stuff its a collection of very intense songs and it actually even intensifies the old stuff
1376519 while we inherited the gmh portfolio with leasing status approximately 5 percent behind last years pace we believe that given our track record for integration and execution we can dramatically impact value with the commencement of leasing activities for the 2009 2010 academic year beginning q4 of this year
1376520 this is looking like a really fine series from the fantastic source of material

1376522 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1376523 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a bit
1376524 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job
1376525 numbers are lower than in athens partly because we have fewer tickets to sell
1376526 in 2004 we could sell 45 000 tickets and because it was in the european union we also had access to all the tickets that were being sold to the greek public we will have enough fans in the crowd and we have a huge contingent of supporters within the team if athletes have the time to support their team mates we will certainly facilitate that
1376527 prices are too high and hotels are costing between six and 10 times more than normal
1376528 but we think that interest after the games will explode
1376529 it could be that britons know they will have a chance to see the olympics on their own doorstep in just four years and they may not have been prepared to travel a long way for these games
1376530 it may be the same with the soccer world cup with people who were happy to travel to germany for the 2006 championships not so keen to go to south africa for the 2010 event
1376531 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
1376532 donate 2 percent of their profits for the last four quarters to a fund that would help struggling americans pay their heating bills
1376533 probably adequate to help with most of the problem that we face this fall
1376534 oreilly rejects right wing defense of big oils massive profits go tell that to some old lady in minnesota
1376535 big oil should donate 2 percent of their profits for the last four quarters to a fund that would help struggling americans pay their heating bills
1376536 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1376537 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1376538 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
1376539 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
1376540 i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organisation will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity
1376541 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment

1376551 a couple of children almost got smacked by a car that wasnt going to stop
1376552 its just disturbing because if you get aggressive drivers coming both ways
1376553 we kind of hope theyll actually stop and ask us what in the world does that mean
1376554 anyone who lives within viewing distance of a stop sign will tell you that they can sit in their yard and watch cars go through stop signs

1376592 surrender is not an option defending america at the united nations
1376593 we are the light of the world we are the leaders of the free world but when we depend on foreign energy we cannot be as strong of a leader as we should and can be
1376594 you need to let your congressman know that he or she works for you not the speaker of the house
1376595 heres a letter from the gardner family in texas they cant afford to both go on vacation and send their son to boy scout camp they cant afford it if the gardners cant then neither should pelosi and the congress
1376596 common sense is not very common in washington d c why arent we using all the resources that we americans can bring to the table we need to use our american ingenuity to solve these problems we will get it done if theres a vote on this floor
1376597 the only way were ever going to bring her to heel and allow a vote is for us to continue to put pressure on her and so its 25 members we had in congress today led by tom price and mike pence its members all over the country doing their townhall meetings doing their rotary clubs theyre all talking about it and were going to keep talking about it until we get our vote
1376598 heres the truth right now progressives are losing this argument
1376599 doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
1376600 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1376601 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1376602 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1376606 despite questions about their origin the lost ogle serves up the wittiest most inventive and cutting edge commentary about the sooner state available today
1376607 i get a little nervous every time i go to it
1376608 the lost ogle is a wonderful place to spend time while in the midst of a 3 hour conference call second only to perhaps the okfuskee county jail

1376613 many many firms are na ve when they enter into the chinese market and dont even think about the fact that wages are increasing there
1376614 someone who just wants to produce t shirts is more likely to go to vietnam or africa
1376615 thats why were advising a lot of our customers to consider production in germany
1376616 by then you might have already lost them to an automobile factory next door that pays more
1376617 where was the idf all these years whenever we complained of rock throwings
1376618 it appears that the idf provides selective protection now it thinks that the arabs are in danger so suddenly it begins beefing up its patrols we have been complaining for years about the dangers to jews and incidents of rock throwings and shootings against jews are many many times more numerous than the other way around yet the army often fails to help us out
1376619 whenever there is a violent incident between jews and arabs the first thing the army does when it arrives is to arrest the jews for instance in the gilad farm a few days ago arabs threw rocks the jews called the police and the next thing we knew jews were arrested
1376620 saying that the police apparently have become confused as to their mission the law says he has 35 days to respond
1376621 we have apparently returned to the days of the british mandate
1376622 when the jews had to contend with a hostile government the government has placed great restrictions on our growth and construction for instance has restricted new connections to the electricity grid frozen zoning plans and has barely done anything to stop the arabs from stealing metal and various infrastructure elements
1376623 i think olmert will try to hammer us as hard as he can its like his last gasp death throes i also think he will try to remove and destroy migron a jewish neighborhood north of jerusalem with 43 families unless the police and army tell him that this is unfeasible
1376624 despite all however am yisrael chai the nation of israel lives
1376625 we are continuing to grow and develop for instance did you know that this coming year we have an increase of 220 children in our nursery schools for a total of almost 1 900 and our population growth is the largest in the country from 23 000 to nearly 25 000 like in pharoahs time the more they try to oppress us the more we thrive
1376626 a meeting to finalise all outstanding issues will take place on august 13
1376627 an inordinate number of kanos churches have either been destroyed during religious violence or demolished by state authorities to make way for construction projects
1376628 none have received adequate compensation alternative sites or certificates of ownership even when these have been promised
1376629 it could contribute significantly towards the search for justice reconciliation and religious harmony in kano state
1376630 they were returning to their village after having participated in a peaceful protest for the release of their two christian sisters and one christian brother who were arrested earlier on april 9 in 2008 at the commune of ia ken
1376631 the security police broke both of their legs both their hands and cracked their skulls after murdering them they returned the bodies to the mens family village and admitted murdering y song nie and y huang nie
1376632 ordered families to bury the corpses in one grave and provided them with one coffin
1376633 it seems the vietnamese government is actually granted permission to murder our people
1376634 in the coming days techdude will provide a final report that fully discloses his discovery and provides all the fancy technical data images formulae etc
1376635 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1376636 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1376637 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1376638 the new plan is really just a lot of words warmed over
1376639 its easy to try to hide behind the words but the reality is barack obama is not leading on this issue
1376640 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

1376647 the child was purple with swelled eyes and swelled black lips
1376648 i was hysterical and someone came up to me and said look at her shes up
1376649 i couldnt believe it most of the time this kind of stuff doesnt happen its a miracle
1376650 i want these people to be there i want to meet them and thank them

1376655 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1376656 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1376657 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1376658 president bush he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he said cheney go take care of this

1376667 the side effects bible the dietary solution to unwanted side effects of common medications
1376668 this could be a big reason why we have what we call the walking wounded and why so many people on drug therapy are having so many problems
1376669 its very simple most doctors consider vitamins and nutrients a waste of time
1376670 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
1376671 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
1376672 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
1376673 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
1376674 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1376675 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1376676 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1376677 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1376678 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1376679 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
1376680 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
1376681 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1376682 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1376683 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1376684 finding an alternative catalyst that will allow us to do oxygen evolution breaking the bonds of water or h2o and forming oxygen in concert with hydrogen
1376685 supposed to be thinking big thoughts all day as part of a fellowship program that recruits phd level scientists into public service with the federal government
1376686 but at a fundamental level studying complex behavioral and genetic networks in animals is not so different from understanding human social networks
1376687 so to some extent when it comes to explaining social software to military policymakers im the perfect guy for the job
1376688 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1376689 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1376690 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1376691 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1376692 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1376693 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1376694 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1376695 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single day thats why they called them the fighting as and they won the world championship
1376696 its not a major deal its what happens it makes teams better

1376700 the personnel entered a second floor meeting room unaware that siddiqui was being held there unsecured behind a curtain
1376701 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1376702 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once
1376703 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and and took her
1376704 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1376705 for a long time my family and i have kept our silence because we knew she was innocent and also based on threats of severe consequences if we spoke
1376706 many of you put your ideas and your requests on hold and now the hold is off
1376707 it should be seen as a sign that the family is healing
1376708 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1376709 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1376710 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1376711 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1376712 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1376713 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1376714 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1376715 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1376716 she has to pay for everything shes put herself through and her daughter through
1376717 i realize that and i think she realizes that too
1376718 she said dad i want to be home for her birthday
1376719 that was catholics doing all of that dont blame that on christians
1376720 dogs do not have chickens chickens dont lay eggs with puppies in them this is apparently evidence against evolution
1376721 you cant have a creation w o a creator evolutionists say that nothing created something
1376722 so is it actually creationist dogma that catholics are not christians
1376723 are you aware of the 1987 us supreme court decision that said
1376724 are you aware of the 2005 federal court decision that said intelligent design is religion and cant be taught in public schools
1376725 its a legal transaction god can now legally let you into heaven
1376726 science that begins with the premise that the bible is true
1376727 jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so
1376728 unless someone can establish the limitations of the universe as a whole it would be presumptuous to point to the cosmos and declare it incapable of existing without an external cause
1376729 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way

1376734 we built dsc on a philosophy of excellence in customer service so we must be in convenient locations to meet the financing needs of our customers
1376735 we are thrilled to open our newest bakery caf in such a growing and robust community
1376736 we chose traders point as one of our strategic locations because its a highly dynamic neighborhood comprised of families and business professionals who desire fresh and nutritional food choices paired with the convenient service that their busy schedules demand

1376745 they have the right to pass their own restrictions of the people who can and cannot live in the community
1376746 the way i look at it is they should have thought about that before they done the crime
1376747 so the way i look at it i dont feel sorry for them at all
1376748 economic conditions continued to result in difficult year over year comparisons
1376749 on a same store basis net revenues were flat while ebitda declined 5 5 percent when compared to last year in addition to the weakening economy increased promotional spending companywide and the impact from the colorado smoking ban contributed to lower margins
1376750 new amenities that came on line in the second quarter including additional hotel rooms at st charles and the earlier than anticipated opening of the parking garage and casino expansion at vicksburg helped to drive some market share growth at those
1376751 regrettably we have reduced our workforce as the economic downturn is more prolonged than many economists expected
1376752 in response to the weakness in the economy we first attempted to drive incremental profitable revenue through increased promotional activity in the first and second quarters which proved unsuccessful therefore in addition to the staffing adjustments we began curtailing promotional spending in the third quarter and we plan to make more significant reductions beginning in the fourth quarter compared to second quarter levels these operating and marketing initiatives will better align our costs with current consumer spending trends which we expect will ultimately improve our margins going forward we believe we can successfully manage our cost structure without compromising on the high quality guest experience for which ameristar has long been known
1376753 we expect current difficult business conditions to continue at least through the second half of 2008 reflecting the impact of the general economic slowdown and higher fuel prices on the gaming industry
1376754 ameristar remains focused on delivering the highest quality guest experience in our markets while diligently seeking to maximize profitability our efforts to adjust our workforce and promotional spending to obtain greater efficiencies combined with the capital investments we have made should position us well to capture additional growth again once the economy starts to rebound
1376755 i am pleased to report that nisource remains on track to achieve 2008 financial results which are in line with our business plan
1376756 in particular i have been encouraged by our teams ability to overcome challenges and remain focused on executing a broad array of important initiatives across each of our business units these accomplishments delivered during a pivotal year for our company are key elements of our path forward strategy for achieving long term sustainable earnings growth
1376757 the pennsylvania settlement is a prime example of nisources commitment to invest in system service and reliability combined with our broader regulatory philosophy of working collaboratively with stakeholders to achieve mutually beneficial results
1376758 this outcome also is in sync with columbia of pennsylvanias ongoing 20 year 1 4 billion infrastructure investment program
1376759 nipscos landmark electric rate case marks the first time in more than 20 years that the company has sought a comprehensive review of its electric services cost levels and rates
1376760 our team looks forward to exploring those changes in a collaborative fashion with all of nipscos stakeholders
1376761 despite obvious and unforeseen challenges our ngt amp s team continues to make significant progress in executing on a steady stream of growth projects to meet the increasing needs of customers and suppliers alike
1376762 in addition to the projects announced to date the team has developed an extensive inventory of additional opportunities which will play a key role in growing our ngt amp s business in the years to come
1376763 as the above discussion illustrates we are advancing on all fronts with a broad array of regulatory commercial and investment initiatives and we are making solid brick by brick progress in delivering on our plan
1376764 bob has boundless enthusiasm for political journalism an unmatched capacity for work and an enduring affection for the sun times
1376765 although he wrote three columns a week a newsletter and books and appeared regularly on television he always was ready to do more for sun times readers whenever big news broke bob was there volunteering to write an extra article for the paper whenever i asked him to do something special for us he had only one response when do you need it he always got it in before that deadline and it always reflected the superb reporting and analytical and interpretive talents he demonstrated in his columns across four and a half decades

1376767 you sense the change that is happening in the debate
1376768 you sense the change that the presumptive nominee of the democratic party senator obama is beginning to see the light on this and we welcome him to see the light on this
1376769 i think if we can continue to push continue to push continue to push then ultimately the american people are going to be winners

1376774 fatherhood is unbelievable it has taken over my life but something else surprised me how much you can love an adopted child the same as you can love a biological child i didnt anticipate that
1376775 research shows that nearly one million hoosiers require some form of skills remediation or further education to remain competitive in todays job market thats a sixth of our total population and nearly one third of our workforce
1376776 the states current resources only allow for 25 000 of the one million in need to get assistance annually thats woefully low and simply not good enough finding a way to bridge this massive gap should be the top priority of our next governor
1376777 there is no other single source that could generate the dollars that are available through the lottery we have to look at the big picture and be sensible our workers need training and we have a means to make that happen

1376786 kudos to canyon ferry road baptist church judge molloy should be inundated with calls e mails and letters educating him on the fact that gods word is not politics its law one he should adhere to and hes in violation of it
1376787 he that will save his life will lose it but he that will lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it recorded in gospels 6 times take up your cross and follw me said jesue truth to set and keep man free from sinful destruction has from the beginning and will always cost in lives over 3 000 in iraq and counting
1376788 the issue of churches and the right to speak out on issues was squelched by lbj in 1954
1376789 these judges are not there to make law but to over see that the law and our constitution is up held any group can meet at church or any where it likes to discuss any subject whether it be political or not the supreme court will rule against this judge
1376790 i believe that the issue of one man one woman marriage is a moral issue one that should be taught from every pulpit however churches must be ever so careful to abide by the laws that threaten our religious freedoms there are a lot of christaphobes and religiphobes out there that are lurking behind every tree just waiting for a chance to attack us best wishes and prayers to the cfrb church
1376791 more people who apparently need a lesson in the true meaning of separation of church and state it does not mean members of a particular faith should be excluded from the political process of voting in a candidate the only thing churches are prohibited from doing is endorsing a particular candidate for office this church was not endorsing any candiates it was exercising its right to freedom of speech and religion by showing its support of a proposition to keep traditional marriage and gathering the signatures of other people who feel the same way the church was not campaigning the church was exercising its right to free speech
1376792 since when has a church not had the right to speak out on issues that are clearly taught in the scriptures there was a time when the church took the lead in forming social issues today the church has become the whipping boy for the courts and the liberals but if you think what happened to this church is a travesty just wait until obama gets elected and appoints three or four radical left wing liberals to the supreme court we wont recover for 50 to 100 years think people
1376793 what the church did was absolutely legal they need to fight the horrible ruling churches do not have to be silent on political issues

1376837 the extra eyes and ears make it probably the safest airport in the country
1376838 this undeserved stigma is rooted in the programs past and is no longer accurate however the badges which have become a lightning rod for criticism and mistrust are its most visible legacy and serve to undermine your service and tarnish the reputation of the program

1376843 stronger consumer protections and clearer prohibitions against unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices are long overdue the credit card industry today is rife with unfair deceptive and predatory practices the proposed rule would put an end to some of these abusive practices unless expanded however the proposed rule would leave untouched some of the most blatantly unfair credit card practices in existence today
1376844 the udap unfair and deceptive acts or practices proposal is very broad directly impacts significant aspects of chases credit card business and if finalized as proposed is likely to have profound effects on chases operations and financial results we have substantial concern that these effects will ultimately work to the detriment of its consumers
1376845 aba believes that the board the ots and the ncua should proceed cautiously in establishing unfairness rules under their udap rule making authority udap situations are often characterized by case specific facts that defy industry wide generalization in exercising their ftca section 18 f 1 rule making authority the agencies must be mindful to apply standards that properly consider the unique attributes of the banking sector and take extra care in performing their analysis because it will have precedent setting application far beyond the particular practices at issue

1376857 it is fundamentally improper for the supreme court to base an important decision like this on its independent judgment about a perceived national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape
1376858 one thing is clear the five members of the court who issued the opinion do not share the same standards of decency as the people of louisiana

1376868 and i think the protectionism that eddies trying to give the club to save their image in fact is detrimental to the very thing you try to build and thats the culture
1376869 another issue i cant understand is why eddie and mick coach malthouse really had to discuss it
1376870 that happens with other clubs but any issue with collingwood gets blown up a lot more than it needs to
1376871 i cant think of any other president that wouldve had to address that issue on the day
1376872 you can understand the clubs frustration after everything thats happened
1376873 i know the shaw boys reasonably well and heath would have been protecting his teammate theres absolutely no doubt about that

1376895 tyson has every right to allow their workers a day off to observe religious obligations but they have no right to substitute for a recognized national holiday give them an extra day off without pay if it were up to me if they have to but not at the expense of american tradition

1376998 the crop that i planted was severely damaged after war veterans ordered my workers off the land as they campaigned for president robert mugabe in the june presidential elections and the little that survived is still facing many challenges which include persistent power cuts and shortages of fertiliser
1376999 power cuts are becoming frequent and as a result the load shedding schedule that the zimbabwe electricity supply authority zesa had availed is not being followed on most days we get electricity during the night and it is impossible to do any meaningful irrigation at that time
1377000 most of the wheat and maize i planted has died off and i will realise far less than what i was supposed to get if electricity was supplied continuously
1377001 close to half of the wheat i planted is damaged and the one field i am tending now is of poor quality due to the water shortage and i have cancelled any future plans of growing any winter crop
1377002 if i had not got any interruptions on the farm i would have put over 100 hectares under irrigation but the countrys politics is affecting current production
1377003 this is my first winter wheat crop but most of it has been destroyed because i have not been able to draw enough water to irrigate the crop and the power outages have been very frequent of late the harvest i will get will be far below my expectations
1377004 the crop was damaged at an early stage as we used to have power for about three days a week but now electricity supplies are being cut almost daily and this is disturbing irrigation cycles most of the wheat is now facing problems
1377005 the projected wheat winter crop is not good but we have learnt a lesson and already we are now preparing for the summer crop
1377006 we are making sure that seed companies are getting seed and fertiliser ready for the season and already we have imported 30 000 tonnes of seed for the 2008 09 season the country needs 50 000 tonnes of seed for planting two million hectares of maize and the rest will be supplied by local manufacturers
1377007 zimbabwe requires 400 000 tonnes of wheat per annum but this year we will hardly get 80 000 tonnes and the reasons are several power shortages and a serious shortage of compound d fertiliser which was nowhere to be seen in the country and as a result many farmers reduced the amount of land they planted
1377008 we will get the smallest crop of wheat that has been produced in this country this year and the only solution to the current farming crisis is to have a political settlement that will address the current problems anything else is just a stopgap measure
1377009 the ministry with the support of the un food and agriculture organization fao has managed to obtain 2 6 million vaccines yet we require 15 million to vaccinate the entire sheep and goat population in the affected areas
1377010 we require technical personnel to be involved in the exercise that is expected to cover the entire northern kanya region it is expansive and expensive
1377011 we know that more goats are dying but the ministry is making all efforts to contain the situation
1377012 we have already approached some donors and i am optimistic they will help i am also hoping to get additional funding from the national disaster programme
1377013 so far the number of sheep and goats that have died since the viral disease was detected in turkana district in june 2006 stands at 2 7 million
1377014 our local traders and producers from the affected areas have been locked out of the market in kenya and abroad market prices have also fallen drastically as a result
1377015 we had an order for more than a half a million goats and sheep to be exported to the arab world before the end of the year but we cannot make it because of the poor health standards
1377016 i almost cried when i saw the goats dying in less than two days the only veterinary officer at the division was away and when he came back he told me that the goats died as a result of the disease
1377017 at the moment i have more than 80 goats but we are spending a lot of money to buy veterinary drugs
1377018 the build buzz blog offers some suggestions of how to use and not use linkedin when pitching such as building relationships with people before pitching them and using tiny url to shorten long links
1377019 est graduates represent the state of transformation in the world the space of having the world work for everyone
1377020 true satisfaction comes from the transformation of self realized by maintaining the integrity of werner erhards abstractions and generating principles
1377021 the hunger project is not about solutions its not about fixing up the problem its not anybodys good idea the hunger project is about creating a context creating the end of hunger as an idea whose time has come as a function of the hunger project we will learn what we need to know to make an ideas time come then we will know how to make the world work
1377022 the hunger project has never denied that werner erhard was one of the founders of the hunger project mr erhard encouraged participants in his programs to support the hunger project
1377023 mr erhard left our board in 1990 and has had no subsequent participation with the hunger project
1377024 a new paradigm a paradigm consistent with the end of hunger the key elements of that new paradigm are self reliance and an enabling environment
1377025 the work of ending hunger is therefore not feeding people
1377026 conventional approaches are based on a framework of thinking that is inconsistent with what actually must be done to achieve the end of hunger on a sustainable basis
1377027 the hunger project believes that the strategies and actions required to end hunger must emanate from a new set of principles
1377028 what is happening in jammu since the last 35 days is a mass movement by the anguished people of the state in every sense of the word
1377029 the profound sense of grievance being felt by the people of jammu needs to be addressed with appropriate corrective measures
1377030 acknowledged on record that the separatist propaganda is behind the decision to revoke the transfer of land to the shrine board
1377031 this is a nationalist movement of and led by the common people against the meek and unjustified submission of both the government of india and the state government of jammu and kashmir towards patently subversive demands made by the separatist elements who have always questioned the very premise that jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india
1377032 demeaning the faith and trust of crores of indians by escalating the anti national mentality of handful of separatists
1377033 on one hand terrorism is uninterruptedly spreading its devilish hold on the entire country on the other hand the congress led central government is nurturing evil designs of the forces who represent and lead separatism
1377034 this government is not for the common man but to serve the interests of one man
1377035 i will meet the congress high command soon and offer to resign from this government which is not doing anything for the common man but working to further interests of industrialists
1377036 the armed forces have in principle accepted the proposal to have women as permanent officers in the tri services the chiefs of staff committee has to take a call on the proposals after which the government will have to clear it
1377037 yes it is theoretically possible for a batch in the national defence academy to have 100 per cent women recruits sometime in the future that is certainly a possibility
1377038 the permanent commissioning would be open for all and there will be no reservations specifically for women from among the seats in the military academies and hence it is quite possible to have all women batches if no men qualify to the academies
1377039 there certainly are differences between war and peace time duties yes permanent commission for women will be in non combat streams till we accept the fact that they will come in contact with the enemy if in combat streams
1377040 however if women officers are not to be in combat arms then it is certainly feasible to provide them permanent commission
1377041 it is not possible because permanent officers generally go through higher courses keeping in view their long tenure of service and the expectant promotions they may pick up during the course of their service ssc officers do not do those courses
1377042 we are hoping for i use the word clean exemption we hope the nsg will recognise and accept the moving pieces the 123 agreement change of us law and so on and gives approval to this
1377043 lord protect my family and me forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
1377044 the first job of any nation state is to protect its citizens and so i can assure you that if i dont even care if i was a politician if somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night im going to do everything in my power to stop that
1377045 and i would expect israelis to do the same thing

1377060 its terrific news that these three parks have reinforced their status as among the best in the uk and that rosehill quarry has again been recognised for its excellence in community involvement and engagement
1377061 our vast range of parks and green spaces wonderfully compliment our stunning coastline and contribute massively to the outstanding quality of life enjoyed in swansea
1377062 these awards are testament to the huge amount of tireless work that goes on behind the scenes to maintain the lofty standards of our parks
1377063 social and behavioral dimensions of national security conflict and cooperation
1377064 to secure the national defense was one of the original missions we were given when we were chartered in 1950
1377065 weve always believed that sociologists anthropologists psychologists and other social scientists through basic social and behavioral science research could benefit our national security
1377066 social and behavioral dimensions of national security conflict and cooperation
1377067 i knew full well that i would be going to iraq
1377068 he is always ready for any mission he just says roger and moves out he is also very handy with tools he chips in wherever he can
1377069 most of the people are not here to do anything bad to us
1377070 things seem to be going great right now but there is always room for improvement
1377071 we are being assisted by our air national guard in delaware mississippi and west virginia
1377072 we look forward to serving the citizens of texas and always have and always will when they need us we will be there
1377073 we would anticipate operating points of distribution shelter communications logistics transportation of food water and ice and medical care
1377074 the u s government and the iraqi ministry of health work in partnership to ensure that all health care facilities are built in areas where services are most needed and that the projects we are working fit the needs of the country
1377075 is a must for the country to continue to thrive
1377076 by focusing our efforts the gulf region division in partnership with ministry of health has made great strides in providing iraqis with the medical care they need and deserve
1377077 as of today we have completed 116 of the 132 new clinics and turned them over to the ministry of health
1377078 however we have found that some newly opened clinics are seeing 300 or more patients a day
1377079 clearly these facilities are filling a need in the neighborhoods that they are serving
1377080 has put together a program to facilitate the return of these doctors through giving them privileges and accommodations in addition to generous salaries that you cannot find anywhere in neighboring countries
1377081 is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
1377082 to be successful we agree with the minister of health that iraq needs a good number of both doctors and nurses
1377083 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1377084 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1377085 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1377086 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1377087 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1377088 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1377089 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1377090 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1377091 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1377092 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1377093 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1377094 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1377095 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1377096 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1377097 run along and go play while i chat with my friends
1377098 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1377099 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1377100 rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional chinese medicine and pets
1377101 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1377102 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1377103 we have industry statistics and case study data which indicates that rich media generates 6 13 more bookings
1377104 travel suppliers that take advantage of this and invest in a professionally produced video and global distribution will see an increase in revenue and be one step ahead of their competition through our partnership with go world productions we will offer hotels and destinations the chance to receive creative direction work with a professional production team and showcase their completed video to millions of travel consumers at a low cost
1377105 were very excited to partner with ice portal and offer a full service video marketing solution to our dmo and hotel clients
1377106 now the powerful video we create for our clients can reach travelers at the point of sale with ice portals comprehensive distribution capabilities the combination of effective video and strategic distribution will create a marketing powerhouse that can only serve to increase tourism sales
1377107 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1377108 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1377109 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1377110 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1377111 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1377112 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1377113 look at hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1377114 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1377115 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1377116 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1377117 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1377118 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world
1377119 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1377120 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1377121 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1377122 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1377123 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1377124 if we fail to act there are severe indications for national security our economy and our environment
1377125 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1377126 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1377127 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1377128 while i do not agree with every part of it i very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which it was constructed
1377129 i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term position
1377130 will youre so sweet to comment in both places ive never heard of
1377131 i watched the video amp commented at youtube those readings were excellent heres a question
1377132 i was waiting at the aspen booth at comic con getting a sketch done by current
1377133 combine that with the vague question that johns asked at one panel does anyone miss bart allen and there has to be something there
1377134 success in the previous years of this pilot program has allowed us to expand it to more states
1377135 ses is a lifeline for students who need more resources and parents who want more options research shows that students benefiting from ses are improving in both their reading and math skills
1377136 children have been the missing face of the aids pandemic and this must change
1377137 results will be measured in lives saved and lives improved
1377138 its in our national interest to help others realize the blessings of a free society so that when we look back at the initial chapters of the 21st century we will say weve done our duty we defended the united states of america and we laid the foundation for peace to come
1377139 their service in afghanistan and iraq and elsewhere is making this nation safer
1377140 and for the family members of those airmen god bless you and thank you for standing with your loved one
1377141 the other day i made it clear that our policy on rotations is now 12 months in 12 months out
1377142 i know the stryker brigade from fort wainwright was one of the first brigades to extend and i understand it puts stress on the families
1377143 because of the progress were making in iraq theres now certainty in the rotations
1377144 well if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime
1377145 i think its important and i know most of you here think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1377146 i know free societies yield the peace we all want
1377147 its in our national interest to keep the pressure on the terrorists to give them no safe haven no place to hide to keep them on the run
1377148 and you have the thanks of our entire nation we honor your service
1377149 there is no finer honor than being the commander in chief of a fine group of men and women and im proud to be in your midst
1377150 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1377151 since 2001 the tax division has obtained injunctions against more than 345 fraudulent tax return promoters and preparers
1377152 the injunction programs goal is straightforward and simple putting fraudulent tax return preparers out of business so they perpetrate no further harm on the nations tax system
1377153 intelligence information is essential to defeating the insurgent terrorist threat and establishing iraqi self reliance
1377154 in the past few months weve seen an unprecedented level of cooperation among the agencies to support the tactical commanders at the regional operations command centers providing strategic and operational intelligence as well as targeting information to those commands
1377155 the capability to produce and action targets has significantly and ill say exponentially improved in all the agencies over the last quarter
1377156 the iraqi security forces have removed a significant amount of terrorists and criminals over 1 200 from april through june as a result of this focused targeting
1377157 were also looking at adding small throw and go unmanned aerial vehicles and some increased analytical capabilities
1377158 ill just say that trust remains an issue both internally within the agencies and external ly among the agencies
1377159 personnel vetting and associated security procedures while improving are not yet sufficiently mature
1377160 establishing improving and sustaining a professionalized intelligence corps but the academy needs to expand its facility to add additional instructors and increase the output of graduates from 2 000 a year in 2009 to about 3 000 a year by 2010 or 2011
1377161 during the past five months weve seen the iraqi security forces take the lead in significant operations in basra sadr city baghdad mosul al amarah and now just this week in diyala
1377162 the successes by the isf in these operations are a result of investments made by the united states the citizens of iraq and the work of the coalition forces to improve the capacity capability and professionalism of the iraqi security forces
1377163 back in 2004 when this transaction happened the mmorpg market was to put it mildly also in a bubble

1377166 we hope these videos will support the healthy emotional development of military children and adolescents during potentially difficult times in their lives
1377167 we also hope these videos will decrease feelings of stigma and isolation in our military children while sensitizing the larger american community to military child and adolescent culture and support needs
1377168 our goal is to reduce the anxiety and fear surrounding a military deployment and let children know they are not alone in the struggles their families are facing
1377169 within just a couple of weeks of my departure my normally well behaved 4 year old son started having some acting out behavior and a little bit of regression kind of moving backward in his development
1377170 he was expressing that he wasnt comfortable with my absence
1377171 when i got back from my deployment a lot of other soldiers were deploying and i began to notice a lot of children who were presenting with complaints of headaches and stomachaches that i couldnt explain
1377172 as pediatricians we are not trained to look that closely at how emotional concerns and stress affect the physical health of our young patients
1377173 however we are hoping to address that lack of training through the videos weve developed and many other opportunities developing through the military child and adolescent center of excellence that is being established at madigan army medical center
1377174 as we start to frame the discussion more in terms of military family readiness and support it is becoming more popular
1377175 as we provide more support for our military families to prepare them for the potential stresses of deployment and separation then our warriors are going to be more able to focus on their mission
1377176 being a military child or adolescent is actually a very unique experience
1377177 we think belonging to a military family really is a special thing military children serve and sacrifice for their nation in a way that is very important and is different from the way we as military servicemembers serve and sacrifice
1377178 they advocate for educational issues for children making sure that military children are treated fairly when they transfer into new school districts and that their credits transfer and they dont have to retake the basic history course every time they move to a new place because they are military kids
1377179 we know children experience stress differently based on their developmental age
1377180 younger children may have significant attachment concerns when their parents deploy they need to attach to their parents feel comfortable and connected in order to grow up emotionally healthy

1377229 normally hed get right back up but he wasnt able to
1377230 hes working on moving it around right now so weve got the full gamut of the medical services working with him
1377231 my heart broke for him because i know what its like to have worked for years and years and have one minute put it all in jeopardy
1377232 i told him to relax and stay positive until we found out what was really wrong its tough on everyone but this is the olympics and you have to move ahead you cant let something like this shake you
1377233 as far as his ability to compete we wont make any decisions until the last possible moment
1377234 no one is panicking right now were pretty optimistic about whats going to happen and brandons ability to compete

1377249 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1377250 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1377251 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well

1377253 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1377254 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1377255 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1377256 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1377257 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1377258 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1377259 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1377260 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1377261 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1377262 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1377263 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1377264 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1377265 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1377266 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1377267 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1377268 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single day thats why they called them the fighting as and they won the world championship

1377271 at a time when nationalist sentiment in india was gaining pace the olympics were the only international arena where indian ness could be projected on the sporting field

1377294 china has become the biggest game development and art outsourcing market in recent years and we believe the market will continue to grow exponentially in the near future with the advanced technology and more than 350 talented developers ultizen has the potential to become the market leader in the industry
1377295 in addition the web based casual game industry has shown tremendous growth as an early mover in this segment we believe that ultizen will become a dominant player and moreover have great potential to expand from a developer into an influential publishing and operating company in this segment

1377306 it is nearly certain the fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the august 5 meeting the market expects a higher federal funds rate at the end of the year we do not the details of the gdp report point to significant weakness in the economy against this backdrop and financial market fragility the fed would only exacerbate the economic situation by raising the federal funds rate in haste fighting inflation will have to remain on the back burner until financial and economic conditions improve by that time inflation is likely to be moderating as it is a lagging economic process
1377307 if it walks like a recession and talks like a recession it must be a recession is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely

1377331 its not good for our country in terms of its image and role in the world to deny this brainpower to be presented at an international conference
1377332 the u s is one of the places where epidemiology and behavioral science albeit incomplete is most advanced and that knowledge is not being diffused
1377333 clinicians who use sensitive screening tests for rare diseases such as hiv should be prepared to haul in many false positive results to find each true positive case
1377334 taken together in the absence of hiv rna data these patients screening and confirmatory results might mistakenly suggest early hiv infection
1377335 unlikely to place a substantially increased financial burden on a testing program because few samples require confirmation
1377336 even at the likelihood ratios and posterior probabilities reported in this study
1377337 rapid hiv screening functions better than many other screening tests commonly used in u s clinical practice

1377339 but this is not all alma says after discussing all the things we should pray over and all the places we should pray from ye must pour out your souls in your closets and your secret places and in your wilderness

1377341 yeah i do that not a problem dont you remember that time a few weeks ago when i was driving home late at night and i was crying and i said out loud come on heavenly father throw me a bone if thats not my whole soul what is

1377364 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1377365 part of what makes fallout great is the juxtaposition of this very happy optimistic 1950s esque view of life pre war and then seeing it after things went horribly wrong
1377366 its seeing those two things against one another that adds a lot to it that everything is blown up but you still see this happy optimism and idealistic view of the world beforehand
1377367 but from a certain standpoint it limits what the game is really about to define it by saying youre just this genre sort of says you cant ever be more than that its a big sandbox and you get to be whoever you want and do whatever you want
1377368 to be perfectly honest the casual guy will probably try hacking once or twice but if hes not into it hes not ever going to do it again and he doesnt have to you can make a choice in the game and you can run around and play it like a story driven shooter if you want its based entirely on the type of character you want to play and what you want to do
1377369 you find these schematics and they list parts and you go find a workbench and you build this weapon and the ammo you use is whatever random junk youre carrying ash trays teddy bears you shove it into this thing and the damage it does depends on the weight of the ammo you can kill enemies with teddy bears it fits what fallout is all about you know humorous but deadly violent
1377370 se a responsabilidade tiver alguma influ ncia no resultado certamente ser negativa pois h sempre carga e stresse na prova s posso pensar tiro a tiro pois caso contr rio falho na concentra o s por pensar em outra coisa

1377374 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1377375 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1377376 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1377377 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1377378 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1377379 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1377380 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1377381 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1377382 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1377383 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1377384 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1377385 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1377386 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world
1377387 comparing the dpj to the nazis is a verbal abuse that completely lacks common sense
1377388 i only tried to raise a question about the absence of proper discussion in the upper house
1377389 i was trying to explain that there have been many such cases in the past after parliamentary discussions were boycotted
1377390 there were similar cases before and thats what i used as an example
1377391 in the past germany invited tragedy by letting the nazis take power
1377392 our ultimatum has ended now they have made a strike and it is our turn to strike whether it will be tomorrow the day after tomorrow or whenever

1377394 it sends a positive message to the voters that the countrys next elections are going to be free fair and peaceful
1377395 best local election held in the country since it became independent in 1971
1377396 it inspires confidence in the electoral roadmap to restore democracy in the country
1377397 everything went smoothly and there were no problems from an organisational point of view to me it was a success
1377398 peoples enthusiasm for voting amid the state of emergency has proved that they want a democratic government through a fair transparent and acceptable election

1377622 all our athletes are in fighting form it will be tough but these 15 athletes have trained hard and prepared for this olympics
1377623 we have high hopes in boxing and taekwondo with a little bit of luck and talent i think they would deliver
1377624 this is the most expensive olympic preparation in philippine history
1377625 i hope that the olympic training program continues including the allotment of the budget we saw it in the athletes how a good overseas training could help
1377626 if our athletes have the adequate foreign training and exposure then we have bigger chances of winning medals so i hope the p30 million budget is made available every year
1377627 this way we dont have to prepare our athletes in the year before or the months leading to the olympics

1377631 the most successful being an anti clockwise orbit of the screen
1377632 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1377633 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1377634 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1377635 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1377636 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1377637 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1377638 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1377639 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1377640 i think the owner of any major sports franchise has two jobs first its to work hard to win a championship year after year and second to be the caretaker of the franchise in the community
1377641 expensive and you may not have a shot at her
1377642 if theres a hooker you want it all comes down to price right and i think thats a better analogy

1377645 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1377646 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1377647 his departure from australia to play rugby union has caused a lot of ink to flow sold a lot of papers and allowed a lot of australian supporters to release their pent up frustrations by mail but the facts are there sonny bill williams is well and truly a toulon player for the 2008 09 season with an option of one year

1377651 there will always be a protocol issue when two ranks are involved we have completed a survey among women officers and we need to look into the issue
1377652 we understand that a sergeant cannot come to the officers mess as per protocol if he resigns or is retired the person can come as the spouse of the officer
1377653 the survey has been completed but i cannot comment on the responses
1377654 even god will not be able to save this country
1377655 they dont have the guts to differ with the opinion of the clerks even god will not be able to save this country in india even if god comes down he cannot change our country our countrys character has gone we are helpless
1377656 you complain about judicial activism when you are in power when you are not in power you come to us for remedy
1377657 we hesitate to agree with the observation passed by the division bench of this court on account of the fact that although there may be different definitions of the word child regarding the age of the minor in different enactments but the purpose of each enactment has to be seen

1377674 theres been lots of talk about a whole raft of proposed changes but nothing is set in concrete
1377675 i believe it is very premature to say that new zealand will field up to nine teams in any new expanded southern hemisphere series
1377676 my unions stated ambition is to play at the highest level but to say taranaki has been in talks in the planning of a new competition is simply not true

1377725 pero esto no deja de ser pan para hoy y hambre para ma ana ya que est n creando tal saturaci n que el consumidor no sabe ad nde acudir

1377733 ik hou niet van praten over invloeden en achterliggende gedachten je moet niet teveel praten over wat er achter kunst zit dat neemt de magie weg een schilder wordt nooit gevraagd waarom heb je die kleur daar gebruikt en welke schilder maakte dat jij ook wilde schilderen nee hij maakt schilderijen en die spreken voor zich zo zou het met muziek ook moeten zijn
1377734 mensen die niet van dansen houden moeten samen naar een eiland verbannen worden dansen gaat om vrij zijn mezelf zijn en in contact staan met mijn innerlijke zelf ik voel me levend als ik dans het is niet zo dat als ik niet dans ik depressief ben hoor als ik niet dans heb ik genoeg te doen al is het gewone leven soms knap deprimerend
1377735 desondanks is het nooit een optie geweest om dance te maken dat lijkt me nou geen flikker aan ik wil muziek maken waar je een beetje bij kan huilen en als ik uitga luister ik naar hiphop of dance ik luister ook nooit naar mijn eigen muziek als ik vrij ben moet er niet aan denken
1377736 ik heb de plaat uitgebracht op mijn eigen label omdat ik totale controle wil over mijn muziek en mijn carri re het was geen optie om het op een ander label te doen want dan had ik sowieso te maken gekregen met gasten die graag beslissingen willen nemen over wat voor mij het beste is daar doe ik niet aan mee dat duurt me ook veel te lang
1377737 natuurlijk er is zo veel te doen man ik heb zoveel inspiratie en zo veel dromen en ik wil ze allemaal waar maken ik wil een bekende hollywood actrice worden ik wil een jaar door zuid amerika trekken ik wil overal liefdes hebben ik wil afrika zien ik wil moeder worden van 10 kinderen voor mijn dertigste nou dan moet ik mijn tijd goed benutten

1377783 the really interesting result were seeing across multiple studies is that these thin models make women feel bad but they like it

1377811 it is indispensable to know at the outset that there are truths inherent in the human spirit that are as if buried in the depths of the heart which means that they are contained as potentialities or virtualities in the pure intellect these are the principial or archetypal truths those which prefigure and determine all others the intelligence of animals is partial that of man is total and this totality is explained only by a transcendent reality to which the intelligence is proportioned thus the decisive error of materialism and of agnosticism is to be blind to the fact that material things and the common experiences of our life are immensely beneath the scope of our intelligence without the absolute the capacity of our conceiving it would have no cause

1377872 the question obviously is whether that erosion will continue as voters continue to learn more about obama and see him less as a media phenomenon and more as a conventional but
1377873 we may ask what is relevant but anything beyond that is dangerous he is a liar the demon is a liar he will lie to confuse us but he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us the attack is psychological

1377903 alexander isayevich gave his whole life to serv ing the fatherland he served it as a genuine citizen and patriot and his heart literally ached over the fate of the russian people and a fair organization of the country a departure of this great man and one of the most influential thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century means an irreparable loss for russia and the whole world
1377904 best known for his three volume work the gulag archipelago solzhenitsyn fought in world war ii endured eight years in labor camps and survived cancer in the absence of almost any medication he first came to acclaim in the former soviet union and the world during soviet leader nikita khrushchevs political thaw when his one day in the life of ivan denisovich an account of gulag life was published in 1962 in the soviet literary journal novy mir
1377905 a labor camp inmate who almost forgets his name remembering only his prisoner number he gets so used to prison horrors and perpetual humiliation that he regards them as normal life the book caused a sensation in the soviet union and abroad and made solzhenitsyn famous overnight
1377906 contained no direct criticism of the soviet system it was a simple but detailed description of one day in a camp prisoners life one almost happy day
1377907 more of solzhenitsyns work was published he felt his time had come and he tried to write as much as possible perhaps fearing that any thaw would be temporary however you look at it solzhenitsyn was of great use to krushchev in his efforts to de stalinize the soviet union
1377908 solzhenitsyn had been sent to a camp three months before the end of the second world war for having referred to stalin and lenin disrespectfully in a letter to an old school friend who was serving on the front line solzhenitsyn spent eleven years in camps special prisons secret kgb institutions and internal exile during that time he twice overcame cancer
1377909 solzhenitsyn again fell out of favor with the authorities under the new soviet leader leonid brezhnev his works were seized and the distribution of home printed copies or samizdat of his stories became a criminal offense in 1970 he was awarded the nobel prize for literature further outraging the soviet authorities solzhenitsyn was stripped of his soviet citizenship and exiled to west germany in 1974 he soon moved to the united states where he spent the next 20 years working on his historical cycle of the russian 1917 revolution while also publishing several shorter works he returned to russia in 1994 three years after the collapse of the u s s r
1377910 not only meticulously chronicled the soviet unions brutality he helped to destroy it and ensure it could not be revived for that he was lauded in the western world rewarded with the nobel prize and reviled by many in his native russia as a traitor yet solzhenitsyn was quite as critical of the materialism and moral turpitude of the west as he was of the cruelty and corruption of his own native land indeed in a famous address to harvard university in 1978 at the height of the cold war he criticized the destructive and irresponsible freedom of western life including the excessive burdening flow of information from the media condemned the u s peace agreement in vietnam and rejected any idea of imposing a western model instead of communism in the soviet union
1377911 has moved back toward the world solzhenitsyn believed in he was a nationalist a fierce defender of the russian orthodox church and he was convinced of the unique cultural role of russia in the world in 2007 putin awarded him a state prize for his humanitarian work it was a belated recognition but as a constant critic solzhenitsyn would probably have disapproved
1377912 was stunned that the soviet forces collapsed so quickly with the great leader stalin seemingly helpless to stop the invaders as the soviet red army surged through eastern germany he was shocked by the neat prosperous towns and homes in contrast to poor neglected russia having written slightly critical comments in a letter the brave red army soldier found himself arrested and sentenced to a labor camp stalin cynically had millions of his own soldiers gulaged for having had a glimpse of the west now the iron entered solzhenitsyns soul he would take on this corrupt state in subhuman conditions he wrote his most famous work one day in the life of ivan denisovich memorizing it since he feared it would never be published
1377913 for allowing russias economy to collapse and its borders to shrink he hated the rise in the post soviet era of the billionaires he believed the country was liberalizing too quickly he thought russia needed a strong center and for that reason came to have a friendlier relationship with putin who was ironically a former kgb head

1377962 hes always putting updates on his blog about his personal life just recently he joked on it that hed been arrested but really he was talking about playing grand theft auto

1378076 the industry uses teasers to draw in students however these can often detract from the core features in a lot of cases the overdraft element will prove to be far more relevant for students in general overdraft limits are increased year by year although the latest halifax bank of scotland account can offer up to 3 000 from day one
1378077 students need to remember the golden rule though that overdrafts will need to be paid back at some stage
1378078 the likelihood is we will see many more products launching before the new term starts but students should make sure they dont get seduced by headline rates and flashy giveaways

1378090 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1378091 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
1378092 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
1378093 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
1378094 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
1378095 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

1378107 but some officials and bureaucrats think this sort of thing is dangerous they believe its shameful for people to demonstrate they think it will cause the government to lose face

1378155 precisamos ter um controle das a es policiais discutamos a cria o de varas e corregedorias de pol cia no mbito federal por que n o precisamos estar abertos a essa discuss o exatamente para evitar os abusos podemos discutir isso no conselho nacional de justi a cnj fundamental que n s discutamos isso uma nova lei de abuso de autoridade eventualmente varas especializadas para corregedoria da pol cia e para contestar os abusos
1378156 combate criminalidade sim mas com respeito aos direitos fundamentais quem eventualmente defende a observ ncia dos direitos fundamentais n o est assumindo a defesa da corrup o todos queremos a efici ncia no combate criminalidade ningu m quer celebrar um pacto quanto impunidade mas n o nos dado fazer escolhas em rela o aos princ pios b sicos do estado de direito
1378157 os meios tecnol gicos dispon veis para investiga es da pol cia federal evolu ram profundamente nos ltimos 10 15 anos isso implicou uma transforma o da metodologia da investiga o que s vezes proporciona determinados excessos n s j remetemos ao congresso um projeto de lei que pro be por exemplo a grava o de conversa entre cliente e advogado quando esses meios tecnol gicos ainda n o eram dispon veis o inqu rito policial ordinariamente come ava com o interrogat rio do suspeito que se dava s vezes por meios n o ortodoxos n o constitucionais as pessoas sofriam viol ncia s vezes viol ncia f sica e aquele depoimento orientava o inqu rito que s vezes chegava cheio de v cios ao judici rio com as transforma es tecnol gicas que ocorreram foram oferecidos meios mais cient ficos de investiga o temos de ver a fase pela qual estamos passando como virtuosa uma coisa a persecu o criminal buscar a verdade quando se investiga um delito outra utilizar esses meios tecnol gicos para uma gest o manipulat ria do estado ou para a produ o de persecu es pol ticas
1378158 diante dos avan os tecnol gicos j n o se pode nem cumprir a lei estabelecida porque n o se consegue transcrever a quantidade de horas gravadas
1378159 existem in meras investiga es em curso em todo o brasil a maioria delas sem nenhuma utiliza o desses procedimentos de escuta telef nica mas n o v m ao conhecimento p blico o minist rio p blico tem trabalhado firmemente para impedir esses desvios em opera es da pol cia federal que devem ser punidos e essa puni o s vir com absoluta certeza a operacionaliza o do trabalho do minist rio p blico s ser definitiva quando tivermos mecanismos mais efetivos de controle dos atos que s o feitos
1378160 a quest o do vazamento em dropes parcelado de informa es muito grave s vezes com intuito de prejudicar a imagem das pessoas de forma indel vel n o poss vel que o estado valendo se de um poder excepcional fa a isto n o razo vel fundamental que se co ba esse tipo de pr tica e a m dia aqui tem responsabilidade fundamental que discutamos isso com toda a abertura o vazamento hoje n o mais a exce o a regra
1378161 neste momento h tamb m um interesse da m dia em divulgar o minist rio p blico tem feito um esfor o muito grande mas reconhece ainda dificuldades principalmente nessa quest o de vazamentos de identificar a autoria eu acho que devemos trabalhar o crit rio de se dar mais seguran a nesses procedimentos para garantir exatamente o conhecimento das pessoas que manusearam informa o a partir de que momento e de onde ela partiu
1378162 temos de verificar regrar algum tipo de precau o contra a divulga o de informa es infamantes e caluniosas sem ferir a liberdade de imprensa isso tem de passar inclusive por um pacto com a pr pria imprensa porque s vezes o que se v al m do vazamento que j uma ilegalidade o uso calunioso do vazamento
1378163 n o podemos aceitar a l gica de que a defesa atrapalha de que se a defesa atrapalha devemos acabar com o direito de defesa no brasil esse um debate atual porque temos um projeto disposi o do presidente lula que trata exclusivamente de reconhecer que no conflito estado cidad o o cidad o n o pode ser a v tima do estado a forma pela qual o cidad o fala para o estado atrav s do seu advogado da sua defesa alguns acusadores passaram a imagem de que iam transformar os escrit rios em dep sitos do crime colocariam se cad veres em escrit rios de advocacia ou n o compreenderam o que a democracia o estado democr tico de direito ou n o leram o projeto atividade criminosa n o inerente advocacia o crime n o tem liga o com a advocacia n o tem nunca teve e nunca ter o apoio da ordem a primeira mentira que foi contada e repetida repete se e as pessoas acreditam nela de que esse projeto blinda a advocacia o que o projeto quis estabelecer e o fez muito bem foi separar o joio do trigo um erro n o pode justificar o outro se algum advogado errou compactuou com o crime ele deixa de ser advogado e passa a ser criminoso comum como qualquer outro e tem a pol cia federal o direito de entrar no escrit rio de advocacia e processar a ele e a seu cliente o que n o pode n o deve sen o n o estar amos no estado democr tico de direito interferir na defesa escutar a defesa bisbilhotar a defesa espionar a defesa
1378164 quando se discutem quest es sobre a liberdade do juiz de primeira inst ncia devemos levar em conta este fen meno o controle ideol gico e muitas vezes psicol gico que se exerce contra essas pessoas n o h na hist ria do mundo na hist ria universal qualquer exemplo de pa s que tenha preservado a democracia tendo transformado a pol cia em poder onde a pol cia se transformou em poder a democracia feneceu h casos de den ncia que beiram a aventura o processo anaconda sobre venda de senten as judiciais denunciou juiz por ter conta no afeganist o
1378165 o que estamos propondo revogarmos no brasil esse estado de medo que atinge todos e n o atinge s a advocacia atinge a todos n s ningu m quer decidir mais nada ningu m quer fazer mais nada com medo da responsabiliza o com medo de ser apontado no outro dia como criminoso em potencial ficamos raciocinando pela l gica do medo e o medo raciocinado sempre fazendo com que o estado seja a raz o de todas as coisas e o cidad o um criminoso em potencial em todas as coisas o estado tudo pode pode controlar o cidad o n o tenho d vida ministro gilmar mendes de que n o estamos em um estado policial o tema desta confer ncia uma reflex o para que evitemos enquanto tempo e cheguemos a essa discuss o
1378166 a pol cia federal n o uma institui o soberana se assim o fosse se colocaria acima dos demais poderes de estado e ter amos aqui no brasil um estado policial isso n o existe perdoe britto perdoe gilmar mendes mas n o verdade que estejamos num estado de medo isso n o verdade at porque se n s corrigirmos essas a es da pf a es determinadas pelo poder judici rio corrigirmos erros do judici rio da primeira inst ncia segunda inst ncia corrigirmos erros do minist rio p blico n o vamos acabar com as escutas telef nicas
1378167 quando n s discutimos a quest o do uso das algemas num cidad o que foi preso pela pol cia federal eu me propus a seguinte quest o todas as pessoas t m de ser tratadas de maneira igual a lei permite que o agente verifique a oportunidade ou n o de custodiar aquela pessoa mediante algemas enquanto a lei n o for modificada isso est delegado ao agente agora o que n o podemos expor qualquer pessoa seja de que n vel social ela for h um apenamento antecipado pela sua exposi o p blica na m dia isso uma atitude arbitr ria do estado que tem de ser vencida
1378168 em rela o s algemas e aqui tamb m eu ressalto a comunh o de pensamento com o ministro tarso que n o se trata de privilegiar pobres ou ricos n s queremos direitos fundamentais para todos e n o enfatizarmos um modelo de classes queremos direitos fundamentais para todos a pris o em muitos casos s se justifica para fazer a imagem e a imagem com algema prender algemar e expor no jornal nacional n s vamos discutir essa quest o na quinta feira j existe em rela o a todos indigna o sobre uso de algema sejam pobres ou ricos em mat ria de habeas corpus o tribunal extremamente aberto est vamos discutindo uma quest o relevant ssima da progress o de regime a partir da provoca o de um r u ele pr prio impetrou habeas corpus de uma carta feita em pres dio temos uma sociedade marcadamente desigual logo o acesso justi a tamb m comprometido muitas vezes as pessoas n o chegam ao supremo tribunal federal porque n o t m advogado
1378169 dif cil porque s o dois valores um o direito informa o e a busca da not cia um dos aspectos mais relevantes da sociedade democr tica de outra parte a preserva o da integridade moral do indiv duo problem tico tamb m porque hoje a pol tica se transformou em um grande espet culo com a cria o de muitos fatos midi ticos e pouco conte do e isso n o uma decad ncia da democracia uma nova etapa sobre a qual n s devemos nos debru ar para localiz la isso s poderia ser resolvido por uma normatiza o forte da lei de abuso de autoridade e concomitante um grande pacto pol tico uma concerta o pol tica do estado com a imprensa que exerce uma fun o p blica relevante a imprensa hoje n o mais como a segunda guerra mundial que tentava interferir no comportamento
1378170 o minist rio p blico defende a ampla defesa dos acusados mas tamb m defende a sua possibilidade e pelos mesmos recursos que a lei garante de fazer prova tem de haver um equil brio tamb m n o se pode a pretexto de garantir os direitos fundamentais impedir que regularmente pelo mesmo processo criminal o minist rio p blico possa fazer prova e comprovar a legitimidade das a es estamos tratando de algo que pede o equil brio de todos
1378171 o minist rio p blico embora seja organicamente estatal est funcionalmente mais vinculado sociedade essa conforma o reflexo da inter rela o entre esfera p blica e privada a institui o se move exclusivamente pelo princ pio da legalidade n o da legalidade burocr tica mas daquela que possui o atributo da constitucionalidade n o se trata de invadir compet ncias alheias nem de construir seu conceito pr prio de legalidade o minist rio p blico n o pol tico
1378172 em rela o ao caso espec fico da opera o satiagraha vazaram informa es e declara es do delegado encarregado prot genes queiroz que deixou o caso alegando falta de pessoal e press o dos superiores que s o contradit rias com essa falta de pessoal ele dizia que n o informava aos seus superiores sobre as condi es da opera o porque n o tinha confian a que eles iriam dar for a para a investiga o que ele estava fazendo como os superiores iriam saber se estava faltando pessoal insan vel essa contradi o tanto verdade que no momento em que o delegado saiu rapidamente se montou uma equipe de policiais que vieram de bras lia e de outros lugares foi repassado o inqu rito e ele est em andamento sem nenhuma espetacularidade se esse inqu rito eventualmente n o alcan ar as suas finalidades eu quero dizer que n o por falta de pessoal porque quem sabe teve ou poder ter algum v cio de origem mas quero dizer o seguinte as investiga es que est o sendo feitas j proporcionaram den ncia por suborno de delegado o trabalho est sendo feito muito bem feito com t cnica neutralidade e com foco isso que est sendo feito nesse caso da satiagraha
1378173 j conversei com o ministro da justi a fundamental que fa amos um pacto de combate corrup o e ao crime organizado necessariamente esse pacto envolver todos os agentes respons veis e que querem um brasil melhor
1378174 o minist rio p blico tamb m atende a essa sugest o quero lembrar minha fala inicial o compromisso do minist rio p blico com a dignidade humana n o apenas no foco da investiga o criminal o minist rio p blico atua firmemente respeitando seguramente os direitos da pessoa na atividade de investiga o criminal e desenvolve um trabalho extremamente produtivo e profundo em favor dos direitos de todas as ordens em favor dos cidad os todos t m conhecimento da atua o firme na defesa do meio ambiente da probidade administrativa dos ndios esse trabalho intenso e firme o trabalho tem de ser de conviv ncia de respeito

1378211 haiti and the dominican republic together account for three quarters of hiv infections in the caribbean although it is one of the poorest countries in the world haiti is making steady progress in providing antiretro viral therapy to people with aids transmission of hiv happens mainly through unprotected sex and while condom use is becoming more accepted in cities poor women in rural areas remain at high risk of being infected
1378212 in mali hiv is transmitted mainly through sexual contact and about 1 7 percent of malis population of more than 12 million is infected the stigma surrounding aids is still strong but a tradition of polygamous marriage adds to the challenge of preventing transmission yet efforts to prevent and treat aids have expanded rapidly and health centers are now able to provide free testing and treatment throughout the country

1378246 lloyds tsb have been harassing me by telephone and by mail putting pressure on me to pay this money back i feel that it is morally irresponsible that the bank can charge people such ridiculous amounts of money especially when some of the charges amount to more than my income each week
1378247 they relate to an unplanned overdraft of varying amounts dating back to september 2007
1378248 in situations where there are extenuating circumstances such as illness that may affect a customers ability to manage their finances we can consider waiving part or all of the charges that they have incurred we will be contacting ms gibson again to discuss her personal circumstances
1378249 a kick in the teeth to the millions trying to reclaim
1378250 the original hold was installed as a test case was announced because of apparent
1378251 yet now a year on the test case decision is out and theres a legally binding precedent setting court decision so why not allow people the chance to ask for their money back
1378252 consumers shouldnt have to wait any longer to claim their money when they have the law on their side
1378253 the test case was intended to help clarify the lawful status of local courts were receiving thousands of claims for bank charges but there was much uncertainty and inconsistency regarding who was in the right
1378254 the result of the test case was that high court judge mr justice andrew smith said that the bank charges are liable for testing under unfair terms and conditions rules many feel that for the fsa to delay the claiming process even further is prejudicial to the consumer
1378255 in appealing the test case banks are having their cake and eating it while customers wait around for the appeal to be heard and a further decision to be made the banks continue to rake in as much as 40 each time a customer exceeds their agreed overdraft or slips into the red without an overdraft in place making as much as 3billion a year
1378256 if consumers have to wait another six months to reclaim bank charges then i see no reason why the situation should not be reciprocal
1378257 the banks should also be subjected to this hiatus and not allowed to implement any further bank charges until consumers can claim their money back
1378258 in the current economic climate this research paints an extremely alarming picture for those consumers without any protection products in place
1378259 one of a range of incentives to encourage people to break free from their poor value current bank and switch to a better deal
1378260 eight in ten people havent switched current accounts in the last five years and over half have never switched we would urge all those who havent switched to have a good look at the account they currently have and see whether they are getting good value
1378261 researching the market to check how competitive your bank is should be routine for everyone especially given how people need to make their money stretch further and work harder for them these days
1378262 many people have a fear of change or the unknown and this equally applies when switching current accounts some people think switching will be time consuming for them fraught with difficulties and probably more hassle than it is worth

1378267 the fsa continues to work closely with the oft and banks in reaching a resolution on the fairness of unauthorised overdraft charges
1378268 our objectives continue to be certainty over this complex issue and a fair and consistent resolution of consumer complaints about unauthorized overdraft charges
1378269 the fsa has reviewed the prevailing circumstances and has decided to offer firms a new waiver the waiver will be for six months when we expect to have a decision from the court of appeal
1378270 is it any wonder that peoples faith in the uk banking system is at a low ebb when no one seems to be able to make a decision
1378271 we are seeing delays on overdraft fees delays on the financial services compensation scheme and all the while nothing being done
1378272 there is an unhealthy addiction to committees and consultations at the moment all at great expense and the consumer loses with every piece of procrastination
1378273 amongst the negative stories that have come out in recent months there is one aspect of personal finance which continues to flourish
1378274 savers are seeing rates as much as 1 30 per cent higher than they were in december 2006 which was the last time base rate was at the same level
1378275 rates on standard no notice accounts the most popular type of account have not been over 6 since april 2001 and then base rate was 5 50
1378276 people with existing savings or those starting to save including first time buyers saving their deposit find themselves in a strong position as the banks and building societies continue to fight to tempt savers through their doors
1378277 since 1 may moneyfacts has received 94 changes for increased rates on savings products even though the previous base rate decision was a 0 25 per cent cut this is an unprecedented amount of increases following a base rate cut and is not something we have seen before
1378278 institutions are adding a wider variety of accounts to their range in order to ensure they have an account to suit every savers needs rather than having the saver go to its competitor
1378279 although not everyone is in a position to save as financial pressures across the board increase those that can need to shop around for the best deal and not let their savings get eroded by inflation in an account paying a low rate
1378280 significant potential for slight errors in financial management to result in hundreds of pounds of charges
1378281 those consumers who incurred a charge were more likely to incur at least six charges than just one
1378282 there is much the banks could do to improve how the market works and we hope this report will encourage them to take steps to do so in the near future
1378283 the retail banking market is open and competitive banks actively seek new customers
1378284 switching is easy and accounts are fee free if you stay in credit
1378285 banks are keen to ensure customers can continue to use their current accounts for day to day transactions without paying fees
1378286 lo preocupante del tema es que los tipos para abaratar costos traen coca na base que despu s van traspasando la cambian con el fin de producir una venta mucho mayor y mucho m s elevado su costo
1378287 christ just get on with it and lets get to the end of this thing
1378288 in an equilibrium that does not work well for many consumers
1378289 personal current accounts are a vital gateway to effective participation in the economy
1378290 weve been getting used to unpleasant surprises on inflation over recent months but junes further rise in the headline rate was nonetheless pretty nasty the headline rate is set to rise further in response to rising gas and electricity bills and could get close to 5 per cent in the autumn
1378291 we saw what happened in the past when inflation got out of control and people found that every penny they got in a wage increase was swallowed up by food and fuel prices going up
1378292 whether you are sitting in the boardroom or working on the shop floor we cannot allow inflationary wage increases because that would mean everyone especially people on lower incomes would suffer
1378293 the global credit crunch and sharp rises in world oil prices have pushed up prices at the pump todays decision will help motorists and businesses get through what is a difficult time for everyone
1378294 postponing the planned increase in fuel duty is also consistent with the governments commitment to support the bank of england in maintaining low inflation
1378295 while city types may be breathing a sigh of relief at the creation of a new powerhouse in uk banking the proposed deal may not be such good news for consumers
1378296 abbey and alliance amp leicester have similar structures making a merger desirable but they have both been key players in driving competition a amp l in particular has long been regarded as the terrier of the financial services industry
1378297 the decision by the bank of england to keep interest rates unchanged will add to the doom and gloom felt by 31 million people fuel bills climbing food prices and household budgets that are getting increasingly stretched additionally lenders have refused to pass on the central banks three rate cuts since december
1378298 by holding rates the bank of england has made the best it can of a very difficult decision
1378299 it is likely that inflation will remain above three per cent until well into next year the monetary policy committee can have little impact on the path of inflation in the short term
1378300 it has not attempted to prevent inflation moving away from the target following the sharp rises in commodity prices
1378301 to do so would have required a large increase in interest rates with such a severe impact on output and employment that it would have risked inflation falling well below target further out
1378302 the board has taken the decision to recommend the acquisition by santander after careful consideration a amp l is a strong and attractive business and its resilient performance is proof of the quality of its franchise
1378303 however the board is acutely aware of the significant external risks presented by the deterioration in economic conditions and the continuing turbulence in the financial markets
1378304 given how bumpy and turbulent things feel now as we approach the runway a hard landing feels much more likely

1378307 the voice of the people radio will be back on the air
1378308 sawt al shaab was closed because of the role it has played in spreading lies and rumors and for causing sedition in gaza after it had forgotten its national and professional responsibilities and its subjectivity in using freedom of opinion and expression as specified by the law
1378309 the closure of the radio station is part of hamas policy of muzzling people critical of their recent actions it is also a means of creating one voice on the airwaves
1378310 our station management made numerous calls to the government and opened many back channels to pressure government officials into getting our radio back on the air we are here to serve the palestinian people
1378311 even if the station crossed the lines and spread erroneous news as the ministry claims the government should have issued a warning first i think its closure is against the values hamas says it is protecting and this hurts everyone
1378312 our association has asked the government to re open sawt al shaab and all the closed media institutions including all three banned newspapers because they are a platform for freedom of opinion and the unity of the palestinians
1378313 sawt al shaab will make every effort to face the occupation and will not be led into internal clashes instead we will concentrate on the popular democratic struggle
1378314 they are abusing basic freedoms and were asking hamas to stop its misguided policies and return to dialogue and national unity
1378315 sawt al shaab is actually one of the national voices of palestine and is has always defended its people by broadcasting balanced news
1378316 international laws which hamas has said it respects like the right to free opinion and speech are being violated the hamas leadership should try not to let their political struggles affect the media and it should return to the negotiating table

1378354 as those audiences mobilised by parties age and dwindle new ones appear on the internet the termites of indifference and contempt corruption and manipulation special interests and private cynicism eat away at parties the able and ambitious can scarcely be expected to decay with them where the prime ministers massive speeches and ethical seriousness recall william gladstone and spring from a tradition of public meetings fabian pamphlets and party organisation david miliband his boldest challenger uniquely among his cabinet members blogs
1378355 the troubling paradox is that voters despise politicians but are not yet ready to wean themselves off the post war state the big task for the cameroons is to persuade the public that this is possible that wiki politics where each of us has true control over our local destinies could be a reality
1378356 well still vote labour because we think they will stick up for us better than the others but were open to offers

1378358 getting involved in politics is more than ever before a way of being made to feel stupid an ineffectual and if you read the newspapers tune in to tv and radio debates or the blogosphere you are also in a unique position in that all of the evidence that you are being urged to take seriously is entirely misleading and for the most part irrelevant things are more unpredictable than ever before
1378359 political parties and politicians in general havent really fought back at all in the same way that a large slice of new labour is losing patience with gordon brown for not coming up with a narrative personally im losing patience with politicians and their unwillingness to stand up for parliament to acknowledge that they have undeserving and malignant rivals that want their powers
1378360 i am just stupefied here the left has officially stamped it now oil is a villain now please ask yourselves when did this start
1378361 i dont know whether to admit it or not you think i should tell them snerdley okay folks some good friends of mine who live here in palm beach bought a smart car and theres a picture of me in it
1378362 we have the most liberal the most leftist candidate who has ever run for president in my lifetime hes a sitting duck this guys policies are aimed at destroying the age of american greatness
1378363 the fact that were spending 700 billion a year on oil is actually a good thing it means we have the prosperity to do it it means that oils being used and oil is the fuel for the engine of freedom

1378370 for savers the only way is up in the credit crunch unless youre a parent with a cash ctf
1378371 the fact that average rates on cash ctfs has fallen in the past year is really disappointing as these accounts are genuinely long term with children unable to access the cash until they are 18 firms could afford to offer better deals
1378372 that said the biggest shock is the gap between the best and worst any parent who is receiving a lower rate than the average should switch or start thinking up a really good excuse to explain where it all went wrong when their children are 18
1378373 every cloud has a silver lining and the credit crunch clouds have at least helped deliver better deals for savers or at least those who can afford to save
1378374 it is striking that average rates on regular savings accounts are around one per cent better than they were 18 months ago when the bank of england base rate was actually higher than it is today

1378381 among others we express our strong concern about elevated commodity prices especially of oil and food since they pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide have serious implications for the most vulnerable and increase global inflationary pressure
1378382 most kids let their parents set up a bank account for them anyway so this is a way of rewarding family loyalty its one of the highest rates in the market for kids and we have a great switcher account for adults too which also pays 8 per cent on balances up to 2 500 gbp
1378383 kids say they like high interest rates and 8 per cent is one of the highest rates out there its encouraging that so many young people seem to be so financially savvy
1378384 many families are feeling the pinch as a result of high fuel and food prices and the impact of the credit crunch on lending but when people are facing money worries they often dont know where to turn we need to make it much easier for people to get access to information help and advice

1378387 i alluded a while ago to a recent trance you read a witchs blog you take the flaky with the profound my friends where instead of finding the forest i usually do healthy and green and crawling with life i found a charred and blasted clearcut the landscape so dry that even the riverbed was cracked and fissured for the non witches in the audience aka most of you water is the element of emotions and it was as if a fire had raged through and evaporated even every drop of groundwater it was frightening considering what i thought was going on it was also extreme when i found a river i followed it to a waterfall with a cave behind it the cave was like a geode inside all amethyst crystals so sharp they cut my feet to ribbons i have not figured out why my feet were bare there was a scrying pool in the middle and i smoothed out a patch of stone beside it using a file and a hasp as i did the rocks bled the rocks bled and soon my hands and feet were slick with it
1378388 i shall allow no man to belittle my soul by making me hate him

1378398 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from former iraqi intelligence director tahir jalil habbush to saddam is just absurd
1378399 if the report is withdrawn then the public needs to know that all the items of the report as presented july 21 have been withdrawn and that we have financial statements without an audit report
1378400 i do not agree that items should have been omitted in the presentation of the audit report
1378401 finally i believe a copy of the report should be forwarded to the rcmp
1378402 to that end i move that a copy of the audit report provided to council 21 july 2008 be forwarded to the rcmp for their consideration

1378429 type 1 diabetes previously known as insulin dependent diabetes typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and requires multiple daily injections of insulin for survival
1378430 according to us data the reduction in life expectancy seen in people with type 1 diabetes is dependent on the age at diagnosis at a minimum life expectancy is shortened by 15 years one study using life insurance records showed a reduction in life expectancy of 27 years in those diagnosed before age 15 a study of patients at the joslin clinic a us clinic specializing in diabetes found only a 16 to 17 year reduction in life expectancy for those diagnosed at ages 10 or 15 however people who are treated at the joslin clinic would tend to be from wealthier families and would likely receive better medical care
1378431 most type 1 diabetics i know have a passive aggressive relationship with hope you never look at it directly it sits there in your peripheral vision the potential for a cure
1378432 if the writer is a socially privileged person particularly a white or a male or both his imagination may have to make an intense and conscious effort to realize that people who dont share his privileged status may read his work and will not share with him many attitudes and opinions that he has been allowed to believe or pretend are shared by everybody since the belief in a privileged view of reality is no longer tenable outside privileged circles and often not even within them fiction written from such an assumption will make sense only to a decreasing and increasingly reactionary audience many women writing today however still choose the male viewpoint finding it easier to do so than to write from the knowledge that feminine experience of reality is flatly denied by many potential readers including the majority of critics and professors of literature and may rouse defensive hostility and contempt the choice then would seem to be between collusion and subversion but theres no use pretending that you can get away without making a choice not to choose these days is a choice made all fiction has ethical political and social weight and sometimes the works that weigh the heaviest are those apparently fluffy or escapist fictions whose authors declare themselves above politics just entertainers and so on

1378442 marketing and selling are not identical then he went on to really wake me up selling and marketing are neither synonymous nor complementary he said one could consider them adversarial in some cases there is no doubt that if marketing were done perfectly selling in the actual sense of the word would be unnecessary drucker went on to explain that marketing was more than just an important business function in fact he said it wasnt a business function at all but rather it was a mistake to consider marketing on an equal basis with other functionary areas such as manufacturing because marketing permeated every aspect of the business here are some of the key aspects of druckers theory on the relationship between marketing and selling a poor marketing strategy cannot be overcome by good implementation or marketing tactics marketing strategy is the governing aspect marketing and selling are neither synonymous nor necessarily complementary the objective of marketing and therefore marketing strategy is to make selling superfluous selling and marketing can be adversarial drucker did not intend to negate the importance of selling advertising distribution and face to face selling are all critical functions drucker wanted us to understand that marketing was the governing factor of any business and was so central to all business that its goal was to make selling unnecessary even if this objective could never be attained in the real world

1378477 as cuesta fights for his life this attack is a chilling reminder of the culture of impunity for those who would attack the philippines media with four journalists already losing their lives for their profession in 2008
1378478 the philippines authorities must fulfill their responsibility to protect each and every person from such violence the fact that journalists continue to be targeted is a clear indication that the authorities actions or lack of actions are not delivering the message of zero tolerance
1378479 yesterday we learnt that inflation in may rose to 3 3 inflation is set to increase further over the next few months
1378480 oil prices have doubled since the beginning of last year and in real terms are now as high as they were in the 1970s
1378481 we believe that a slowdown in the economy this year will be necessary to dampen price and wage pressures and ensure that we fulfil our remit by returning inflation to the target
1378482 there should be no doubt that the mpc is prepared to take whatever action is needed to return inflation to the 2 target and to keep expectations of inflation in the medium term anchored to the target
1378483 we face the most difficult economic challenge for two decades but i am confident that we can meet it inflation will fall back and growth will recover
1378484 we must recognise the need to reward efforts of people who work hard but to return now to inflationary pay settlements would undermine rather than raise peoples living standards with a damaging circle of wage increases eroded by steadily rising prices
1378485 the twin global shocks of rising commodity prices and the credit crunch have led to growth forecasts for advanced economies being halved in the last year i expect the uk economy to continue growing but for growth to slow this year
1378486 rising fuel gas electricity and food prices mean that average real take home pay will stagnate this year
1378487 current account providers have been working hard to tempt consumers to change by offering ever enticing in credit interest rates and new packaged options however our research shows that most people tend to stick with their current provider despite derisory in credit rates and extortionate fees
1378488 to be blunt banks will continue to try and get away with as much as they can until there is a real threat consumers will change providers if they dont get a better deal
1378489 the current account market is very competitive at the moment and there are some good deals available as providers seek to attract new customers and retain existing ones
1378490 it has been apparent for some time that there is an eagerness on the part of the banks to market their paid for added value save 2 500 by london olympics with a high interest savings account building societies experience record 6 months for savings accounts
1378491 while you might be forgiven for thinking that the internets biggest draw is social networking sites nowadays its actually online banking
1378492 indeed the credit crunch is making britons far more conscious about keeping in control of their finances
1378493 current account providers have been working hard to tempt consumers to change by offering ever enticing in credit interest rates and new packaged options however our research shows that most people tend to stick with their current provider despite derisory in credit rates and extortionate fees
1378494 to be blunt banks will continue to try and get away with as much as they can until there is a real threat consumers will change providers if they dont get a better deal
1378495 whilst a rate for life will appeal to some savers who arent inclined to shop around regularly for the best rates it really does depend on what that rate is

1378500 janganlah salah seorang kamu mendahului ramadhan dengan berpuasa sehari atau dua hari kecuali seseorang yang berpuasa dengan satu puasa adat kebiasaannya maka berpuasalah pada hari itu
1378501 hadis ini dinilai sahih oleh tirmizi ibn hibban hakim tahawi dan ibn abdil bar dan ia dipertikaikan oleh ulama yang lebih hebat daripada mereka

1378503 told of the companys budget pitch by a reporter some whole foods customers said they had not noticed cheaper prices a few laughed
1378504 rates on savings accounts move frequently so its important to keep an eye on them and ensure that you are receiving a fair and competitive return savers should be aware that an account that features in todays best buys will not necessarily be such a great deal tomorrow
1378505 as we approach summer we are urging people to take an active interest in sorting out their finances with the cost of living increasing this is no time to relax it is important that people take stock and ensure they know exactly what they owe and when
1378506 struggling financially can feel like being the passenger in a speeding car with things moving very quickly and seemingly totally out of control
1378507 even when people want to sort their financial situation out they may not know where to go for information and advice
1378508 inflation is likely to rise significantly further above the 2 target in the next six months or so
1378509 as things stand inflation is likely to rise sharply in the second half of the year to above 4
1378510 faced with the recent sustained commodity price shocks in oil and food the rise in inflation has been extremely moderate compared with the behaviour of the economy in the 1970s and 1980s
1378511 in the view of the chancellor what we are seeing is a temporary spike in the inflation rate but this should decline in due course and of encouragement is the view that wage settlements are relatively subdued
1378512 the governor seems to have stated the view that a crunch of the domestic economy to drive down inflation expectations is both unnecessary and undesirable this view will only hold so long as wages remain muted if these do become unhinged then the market expectations which we can currently observe for several rate hikes will come to fruition
1378513 it is disappointing that there is no acknowledgement of the role of excessive monetary growth in accommodating the impact of these pressures on domestic prices
1378514 unsurprisingly the letter implies current official rates are appropriate balancing upside and downside risks
1378515 as food and fuel prices continue to rise and people feel gloomier about the economy more consumers think it is a bad time to save
1378516 this is a shame given many savings providers are offering highly competitive and attractive rates at the moment and illustrates the current squeeze on consumers ability to save
1378517 the products available mean its a good time for savers
1378518 the usual assumption that a slowdown is bad news for companies is true but some companies are resilient in their ability to make money even during a slowdown
1378519 the defensive sectors should do relatively well during a downturn but there will also be opportunities for other companies to benefit in a slowdown through perhaps buying cheaper assets winning new customers or advising those who are experiencing difficulties
1378520 the likelihood of tenant default is expected to increase as economic growth slows so it is important to minimise the risk of tenant default on any portfolio or asset the result of falling values is that yields rise and for investors looking for a high income return the period following a fall in values offers a strong opportunity to find good value
1378521 getting a good deal for consumers is what which exists for so its a pleasure to celebrate the businesses and individuals that are delivering that ideal todays award winners truly represent the best of the best in uk products and services
1378522 while many of our competitors are cutting the interest they pay to customers on their current accounts were bucking the trend offering one of the best deals on the market
1378523 by upping the interest we pay on our plus accounts everyone will be able to make the most of their current account balance
1378524 lloyds tsbs 6 per cent interest on its plus account reignites the current account price war and represents excellent value for bank customers who keep 2 500 balances in their accounts
1378525 competition in the current account market has been muted recently as banks have held fire so its good to see new signs of life and importantly the offer is open to new and existing customers so its not just a way of winning new business
1378526 across the market as a whole the average credit interest paid is just 1 94 per cent although if you ignore those paying a miserly one per cent or less then the average is 3 52 per cent that should be the new benchmark for current account customers
1378527 this move follows the trend of increased competition in the credit interest market which is of course of benefit to consumers although it follows the pattern of only offering these interest rates to those who can meet the regular funding requirement
1378528 it appears that those who have the funds can benefit from better interest and better overdrafts but are those that would benefit the most from these deals being excluded from the market
1378529 producer output prices accelerated further in may but the aggregate ppi producer price index is not generally a good short term guide to cpi movements however the ppi food component correlates closely with consumer prices of processed food and showed a further large rise last month if reflected in the cpi this would add an estimated 0 12 percentage points to the annual increase sufficient to reach 3 1 percent assuming no other changes
1378530 with rates on fixed rate bonds continuing to increase for the first time in many years we have seen all of the top six moneyfacts co uk best buy places being taken up by rates of over 7
1378531 fixed rate investments are not suitable for everyone but for anyone who doesnt need access to their money for a period of between six months and five years then rates as high as 7 10 per cent can be found
1378532 with the banks and building societies struggling to raise money on the money markets tempting savers has become increasingly important
1378533 passing through the most prolonged period of financial turmoil that most of us can remember
1378534 would not be right for the bank to take back banking supervision from the fsa
1378535 it is often said that the role of a central bank is to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting going
1378536 that approach has served us well in monetary policy but all those efforts will come to naught if the opposite applies to the financial sector if banks feel they must keep on dancing while the music is playing and that at the end of the party the central bank will make sure everyone gets home safely then over time the parties will become wilder and wilder
1378537 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1378538 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1378539 american intelligence agencies are convinced that iran which sits on more energy resources than its civilian economy will ever need is pursuing reactor and other nuclear technologies from russia and china to develop atomic weapons
1378540 the fact that more than half of britons are affected by bank charges should urge the banks to act in their customers best interests but they are more concerned about the 3 5 billion a year they are raking in from them
1378541 with the cost of living on the rise consumers are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet banks have a responsibility to their customers to provide fair bank charges currently people are being charged up to as much as 40 for exceeding their overdraft
1378542 some people are offended that we are taught to address god as father the greater offense may be the little word
1378543 the first thing it says is that pregnant women have to leave the room until completion
1378544 we are looking forward to finalising the terms of the transaction with the catholic and to welcoming the catholics members into the chelsea family in due course
1378545 we are delighted to have chosen chelsea as our merger partner the catholic and chelsea have much in common and share common values around mutuality and people
1378546 the costs and time taken to comply with all the various regulations are particularly onerous for smaller institutions
1378547 with a small building society there will be a limited number of staff and they have to devote a disproportionate amount of time to dealing with regulations which inhibits them from devoting time to other matters
1378548 the mpc minutes which are published later this month june 18 should give some more information on how the mpc members judged the risks in what is a highly uncertain economic situation
1378549 if the slowing in economic activity is viewed as supporting lower inflation in the medium term a further rate cut could still be on the cards later this year although much will depend on how inflation develops in the coming months
1378550 the mpc finds itself in the middle of a difficult balancing act involving rising inflation on one side and slowing economic growth on the other
1378551 there is no doubt that uk economic growth is moderating the credit crunch has reduced the availability of credit the housing market is slowing down and the high street is showing signs of softening
1378552 however as you look into 2009 slowing economic growth should reduce capacity pressures and thus inflation and therefore there is still the possibility the mpc could cut interest rates later on in the year
1378553 the worry is that worsening inflation figures in the months ahead could push inflation expectations up even further making a rise in actual inflation a self fulfilling prophecy
1378554 cutting base rates in this environment is not a realistic option so the mpc was right not to move
1378555 tackling companies who are engaging in unfair business practices by targeting vulnerable consumers with misleading advice and information particularly if it leads to consumers becoming more over indebted is a key priority for the oft we expect any advice and or information given to debtors to be in their best interests and it should include a full explanation of the implications of offers or advice
1378556 the british bankers association is pleased to see the office of fair trading putting a high priority on the advertising of
1378557 we hope this initiative will extend to address some of our other concerns in relation to debt management such as the increase in cold calling lack of advice on appropriate solutions for those in debt and the lack of proper information on the long term effects of some of the solutions
1378558 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1378559 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1378560 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1378561 the near term outlook for inflation has deteriorated markedly over the past three months
1378562 almost certainly push inflation up further possibly significantly in coming months
1378563 as those price increases feed through to household bills they will lead to a squeeze on real take home pay which will slow consumer spending and output growth perhaps sharply
1378564 the fsa has said that on the date it announced the waiver 27 july 07 it stopped the clock so the time out issue wont arise yet it does not have power over the courts so for safety its best to assume the clocks still ticking
1378565 its time savers started to take care of their savings by choosing a home for them wisely especially in the current economic downturn there are hundreds of poor paying accounts so people need to avoid them
1378566 if you dont know what interest you are currently earning contact your provider
1378567 this research shows how current market conditions are playing on the minds of britons despite a marked increase in living costs people are becoming more cautious and managing to save more and spend less with their financial future in mind
1378568 these findings are a stark illustration of how the credit crunch is already affecting consumers its clear that the rising cost of everyday living is having an immediate impact on our ability to save many of the uks workforce are at what could be described as a financial tipping point where just one unexpected unfortunate incident could have dire financial consequences
1378569 high interest accounts are a great addition to the market particularly for those with modest balances looking to make their cash work harder
1378570 increasing numbers of consumers are struggling to keep their finances in check and are finding their bank accounts being put under extra pressure as they try to cope with soaring fuel and food costs
1378571 it is vital that people keep a keen eye on their current account balance as the financial consequences of going into an unauthorised overdraft making purchases without the funds to cover them or having items returned by their bank or building society will only inflame the already difficult situation
1378572 the stakes for both sides are extremely high so this has all the hallmarks of being a very lengthy judicial process next step is the court of appeal and after that the house of lords and maybe even europe
1378573 if the original judgement is ultimately upheld and a substantive hearing rules that the charges are unfairly high the most likely outcome is that a cap will be placed on the charges but crucially the banks will still be entitled to make an element of profit in the fees charged
1378574 the bba has confirmed that banks will appeal against the high court ruling on unfair charges
1378575 with the consumer prices index cpi at three per cent and the inflation report guiding to little short term relief from rates
1378576 my question is which is it is it half of wage growth or twice wage growth the answer to the question is important particularly as we go into the autumn wage negotiations it looks unlikely that we will see an interest rate cut in june
1378577 the april judgment decided that the banks current terms and conditions that relate to these fees are not penalty charges that these terms are in
1378578 the court also considered the terms could be assessed for fairness under the utccr regulations but that did not mean that the charges were unfair the banks are to appeal this part of the judgment as they consider these types of fees are fair and the regulations do not apply to them however it is also in the public interest to have full clarity and it is only the court which can make the final decision on whether the charges are fair
1378579 customers who have never paid a fee for an unauthorised overdraft understandably take a different view from those who have
1378580 people whove paid charges are also understandably keen to get their money back and are convinced the banks have been unfair
1378581 the worry however is that the banks have a lot to lose if the case goes against them and if they lose they will look to get their money back well get rid of one set of charges only to be stung with a whole other set of charges
1378582 i am delighted to appoint adair turner as chairman of the fsa
1378583 i would also like to take this opportunity to thank sir callum mccarthy for his dedication and contribution over the past five years sir callum has provided the fsa with leadership during this period particularly during the severe pressures in financial markets since last august continuing the transformation of an organisation and the development of a regulatory system which is recognised internationally as world leading
1378584 i am delighted to be taking over from callum mccarthy at the fsa and look forward to leading the authority as it meets the challenges ahead
1378585 lord turners appointment is an outstanding one for the fsa and will be well received across the industry
1378586 i worked with him on the low pay commission some years ago and his stewardship of the cbi confederation of british industry shows that he understands the costs of regulation to business
1378587 we have listened to our customers and acted on this feedback by completely revamping our unauthorised overdraft service replacing it with the new personal reserve
1378588 our customers wanted a simple clear way of managing payments when they go beyond agreed limits
1378589 the overall package of changes we are making for new and existing customers provides a simple clear choice and improved value marking a step change in current account banking in the uk
1378590 with still very much on the agenda as the oft court case rumbles on barclays has announced some radical changes to its current account range
1378591 developments in financial markets the international economy money credit demand and output and costs and prices
1378592 although economic activity was likely to slow the committee had judged that some slowing in the growth rate of output was likely to be necessary for inflation to settle close to the target around two years ahead
1378593 the factors pushing inflation up oil and other commodity prices were beyond the mpcs control
1378594 with global inflation so high the burden of an economic slowdown is likely to be felt most severely in countries with the weakest financial positions a decade ago that was asia today it is the us and the uk
1378595 while the bank of england anticipates below trend growth in 2008 and a recovery in 2009 our recession predictor is suggesting concern
1378596 i made it quite clear to christ church that despite all its best efforts noble intentions and hard work its money needed to be managed in a much improved fashion

1378610 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

1378619 waiting unduly before easing further would pose unacceptable threats to growth
1378620 the longer the mpc waits the bigger the danger that the situation will deteriorate and the policy choices will become more difficult and more unpleasant later in the year
1378621 it is possible that stagflation might reappear as we are going through a slower phase of growth although i do think the word can give the wrong impression
1378622 attitudes towards paying a monthly account fee have hardened over the past 12 months
1378623 the volume of reclaimers is staggering this truly is an armchair consumer revolution its hoped the banks wont delay the process further by appealing this decision
1378624 its time the regulator the fsa lifted its hold on reclaiming and gave people a chance to get their money back
1378625 decided by an independent expert using the common approach taken to such cases and past practice
1378626 but the government seems to have determined that it wishes to pay nothing and has set totally artificial terms of reference
1378627 many smaller shareholders do not seem to have realised that the government is intent on paying them nothing
1378628 in addition they are under the false impression that the shares will be returned to them after the period of temporary public ownership trumpeted by the government which is clearly not the case
1378629 i have had shareholders in tears to me on the telephone after i have explained to them the true situation and that their investment in the company is effectively lost they simply do not understand why the government would take away their shares which were backed by substantial assets and not pay fair compensation
1378630 while its great to hear that manchesters big spenders are enjoying their money and lifestyle today its also important to think about how managing your money better today can mean more savings for tomorrow

1378632 inflation figures raise serious doubts about the specification of the inflation targeting regime as well future economic prospects
1378633 with cpi consumer price index inflation now at three per cent and hefty transport energy and food price increases yet to come it is now inevitable that the cpi will move and stay well above the target range this summer requiring the governor of the bank of england to write a letter of explanation probably several to the chancellor
1378634 there is little that the mpc can do about that at this stage however it seems clear that interest rates will be on hold over the next few months leaving the economy prone to the after effects of the credit crunch
1378635 public perceptions of inflation are increasing and with inflation moving still higher there is an increasing risk that wage and other second round effects will break out
1378636 however monetary and certainly credit conditions remain tight and this should ensure that over the mpcs monetary policy committees two year horizon the upward pressure from world food and energy prices is offset by weakness in core inflation against this background upward pressure on prices will continue to mean reductions in disposable income particularly at the lower end of the income scale
1378637 this leaves the government with an important decision to make over the future of the inflation target
1378638 alternatively the government could make an active choice about the inflation growth trade off and raise its inflation target for the next couple of years
1378639 when most refer to the race card what theyre saying is that someone has claimed that they are the victim of racism when in fact they arent in an attempt to soil the image of their opponent
1378640 it is always fun to give both barrels to the left
1378641 does this mean that every time a racial angle can be found in any direct political attack that said angle will become the main issue
1378642 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
1378643 sorry for anything that may have sounded racist we didnt mean it like that lets all just move on
1378644 if mccain and the right werent racist at all they wouldnt be attacking obama for saying that
1378645 the new guarantee gives people the peace of mind that with the saga online top 5 tracker account they are receiving a consistently competitive rate on their savings not just a high headline rate that could be arbitrarily cut at anytime
1378646 unlike many providers we arent just offering this rate to new customers all of our existing online savings account customers will also automatically receive this enhanced rate
1378647 most analysts expect the bank of england to hold interest rates steady on thursday but cut them for a fourth time since december next month
1378648 this weeks mpc rate decision is a particularly difficult call
1378649 activity indicators are at levels historically consistent with a quarter or even half point bank rate cut
1378650 the near term inflation outlook remains troubling however with the may inflation report likely to show a larger and more prolonged overshoot than projected in february
1378651 consumers are increasingly looking at ways to save money in the current environment but forgetting to look at ways to make money it is astonishing a quarter of people have only ever had one current account when providers are continually introducing new rates to compete with each other
1378652 its a shame consumers seem hesitant to change as most providers make the process as easy as possible if you could buy the same tv for 210 less somewhere else you wouldnt think twice however when it comes to current accounts it seems consumers are happy to miss out
1378653 at its heart the financial crisis has been triggered by the mix of surging private debts booming asset prices strong private spending and plunging private savings
1378654 the bank of england liquidity scheme is not going to reduce the risk associated with mortgages and people who expect it to have a substantial impact on rates are likely to be disappointed
1378655 rising us sub prime defaults were the trigger for a broad based repricing of risk and deleveraging in credit markets
1378656 those who think that lying on application forms will give them any advantage need to realise that their efforts are counter productive
1378657 fraud data sharing means that such lies are easy to detect and far from enhancing an applicants chances will be detrimental to their application telling the truth even if it is slightly less palatable remains the best policy
1378658 our research suggests there is a growing trend emerging between partners and how they manage their finances with people having separate bank accounts so they can keep control of their own finances
1378659 household and business spending has been subdued and labour markets have softened further
1378660 financial markets remain under considerable stress and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1378661 with many people thinking that the base rate is likely to fall further this year some of the fixed rate products available now look outstanding value
1378662 the actions we have announced today achieve a step change in our capital strength and our target ratios this allows us to consolidate our competitive position in our core markets
1378663 we are planning for a more challenging environment ahead and the proceeds of the rights issue should ensure that we benefit from strong ratios even if the macroeconomic environment deteriorates further
1378664 the group will be well positioned to benefit over time from a number of selective growth opportunities across our business where there will be scope to earn good returns
1378665 we recognise that although there are many reasons why customers may have impaired or limited credit records this does not mean that a new business venture cannot be successful frequently they have learned valuable lessons from the experience as the leading bank for small business we work to encourage business ambition and support budding enterprises and as such natwest and rbs will open accounts for customers with a limited or poor credit history on a credit only basis
1378666 bcc welcomes this move by natwest and rbs which will further encourage the spirit of enterprise in this country and may also turn around the fortunes of those enterprises previously thwarted in their attempts to obtain support for their business
1378667 in 2007 the disciplined execution of our strategy has resulted in good earnings growth for our shareholders despite difficult market conditions with our multi brand distribution strength strong balance sheet and low cost operating platforms we are well placed to take opportunities presented by these difficult markets and deliver good growth in shareholder value over the next few years
1378668 we are planning for a more challenging environment ahead and the proceeds of the rights issue should ensure that we benefit from strong ratios even if the macroeconomic environment deteriorates further
1378669 rising us sub prime defaults were the trigger for a broad based repricing of risk and deleveraging in credit markets
1378670 prices in some credit markets are likely to overstate the losses that will ultimately be felt by the financial system and the economy as a whole as they appear to include large discounts for illiquidity and uncertainty
1378671 conditions should improve as market participants recognise that some assets look cheap relative to credit fundamentals with sentiment still weak the bank has announced a special scheme to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and to increase confidence in financial markets
1378672 these findings are a stark sign of the times but they are also exacerbated by the hype surrounding the credit crunch
1378673 with some attractive savings products available you might think people are barmy to stash their cash at home unfortunately some savers now have an exaggerated view that investing their money with a building society or bank can be a risky business which is not the case
1378674 people should speak to their savings provider if they are looking to invest or if they are concerned about existing investments in the vast majority of cases people will be reassured
1378675 its obvious that parents have felt the pinch as a result of being sapped for thousands of pounds from their adult children and are now turning the tables on them and sapping back
1378676 as over a third of parents 36 per cent planned to use the money they handed out to their children for their own retirement they are finding that they are missing the money in their later years
1378677 i do expect the trend of parents having to go back to their children for money to increase in the future
1378678 it seems that although people could well be tightening the purse strings at a time when the credit crunch could affect finances families have to resort to helping each other out
1378679 the amount of money given or loaned by parents and the number of children sapping savings have both increased in the last year to the extent that the overall sap fund of children from their parents savings is well in excess of 60 billion
1378680 as the figures show handouts are increasingly being used to provide an emergency loan or to pay off debt
1378681 it would be in all consumers best interests for both sides to come to an agreement instead of letting the case drag on through the courts
1378682 until the case is resolved complaints remain on hold and charges continue to be applied to accounts unless a customer is considered to be in financial hardship
1378683 taking expensive charges from customers who had exceeded their credit limits and were already in trouble only perpetuates the problem of debt
1378684 these people needed help and guidance from banks not draconian punishment and these excessive fees meant they would have less money each month to cover their living costs putting further strain on already overstretched budgets
1378685 in the light of the outlook for demand and hence inflation in the medium term it was appropriate to look through the near term increase in inflation which was likely to be short lived
1378686 a 25 basis point reduction now would be consistent with market expectations of a gradual easing of bank rate
1378687 the banks welcome the judgment that the court has issued today on the first stage of the test case relating to unarranged overdraft charges
1378688 the test case process was initiated by the banks with the oft to bring clarity to an issue which is of concern to a large number of bank customers
1378689 the court has emphasised in the judgment that the question of whether the banks charges satisfy the fairness requirement of the utccrs has not been determined by the court
1378690 that is a question that can only ultimately be decided by the court and not for example by the oft
1378691 after many months of uncertainty the office of fair trading is now free to intervene on overdraft charges setting what it feels is a fair rate
1378692 however this will be a complicated and lengthy process and consumers should not expect to know their fate for a long while yet it is also likely that the banks will appeal further delaying the saga
1378693 we know one thing for sure banks will not take this lying down and will find other ways to maintain profits regardless
1378694 the decision paves the way for a further hearing in which the court will decide whether the charges are unfair and if so what a fair charge should be
1378695 however lets not get too excited as this is the very first stage in what could be an extremely long process in reality this will take years not months to conclude
1378696 for two years fool co uk has deemed unauthorised overdraft charges to be excessive and unnecessarily punitive
1378697 we urge banks to cooperate with the oft and we also hope they will not challenge todays verdict
1378698 appealing todays judgment will prolong the pain unnecessarily for disadvantaged customers it is cruel to make customers wait another nine months or more to recoup what is rightfully theirs
1378699 this is an important early milestone for the oft and our investigation into this area of high consumer interest
1378700 this does not necessarily mean they the charges are unfair
1378701 we are now analysing the implications of the judgment for our overall investigation into the fairness of the terms
1378702 based on the facts currently available to it and a number of assumptions hsbc bank plc estimates that the financial impact could be approximately 600 million approximately 302 million
1378703 hsbc bank plc considers the charges to be and to have been valid and enforceable and intends strongly to defend its position
1378704 the proceedings remain at a very early stage and may if appeals on the preliminary issues or subsequently on substantive issues are pursued take a number of years to conclude
1378705 to make an estimate of the potential financial impact at this stage with any precision is extremely difficult owing to among other things the complexity of the issues the number of permutations of possible outcomes and the early stage of the proceedings
1378706 it is good news for individuals that income tax is dropping but there will be millions and millions less for charities to claim back
1378707 every pound counts particularly as we fear that this will be a hard year for charities anyway due to the economy slowing
1378708 if you are a uk taxpayer and are planning to make a one off donation it would be best for your charity if you give before april 6
1378709 this is money we will have to find from somewhere else if we are to continue all our work to fight for a better deal for the most vulnerable older people in the country one off donations before the end of the financial year to help us make up the shortfall would be extremely welcome
1378710 although men are generally the main income earners in a family it is fascinating to see that most financial decisions are actually made jointly by both the mother and the father
1378711 indeed this puts the myth of the father as the financial head of the family to rest in addition while men rarely appear to have the final say so in matters of finance women often step up to make the day to day decisions with regards to spending on their homes and children
1378712 although banking habits are not always at the forefront of peoples minds when fair trade is mentioned some banks and building societies are looking to make a difference
1378713 sustainable and successful businesses that serve a social purpose this includes community finance initiatives through which funds are placed into a central pot to be used by various social enterprises
1378714 ethical accounts dont always promise to pay the highest rates of interest
1378715 and you may not get the lowest rates with a green mortgage but they can allow people to have a direct impact on peoples lives or on the environment
1378716 many people see further rate cuts as a necessary means of easing pressure on household budgets
1378717 the fed has slashed rates dramatically in the us and some people believe this should be replicated in the uk particularly for those struggling with high payments
1378718 the monetary policy committees decision is not as straightforward as people might think when it comes to setting the base rate inflation must be taken into consideration as must the countrys general economic condition
1378719 therefore it is likely that rates will be cut with an air of caution if there are to be further reductions this year
1378720 if the rate is increased this will be good news for those with however homeowners are likely to feel the pinch
1378721 opportunity to introduce changes that can make a real difference to peoples wealth
1378722 more can be done to encourage consumers to use their isa allowance and embrace the tax efficient benefits they bring
1378723 if small businesses are to remain the lifeblood of a growing economy then its up to the government to deliver some good news and provide a boost to britains small business owners
1378724 what is really interesting about this months results is that it is clear that the reported economic downturn is not having a uniform impact
1378725 although it is good to see people are exercising caution with their spending they are not changing their behaviour dramatically it will be really interesting to see next months results which will be taken after the recent stock market volatility and see if this has filtered down to peoples spending behaviour
1378726 it is possible that the older generations have a clearer memory of previous recessions and are acting cautiously as a result of this as people become more cautious with their spending habits now is the time to really think about building a savings plan which could prove invaluable if the recession really takes hold even saving just a few pounds a month could make all the difference if times get tough
1378727 the small business current account market has become very competitive in the last few years and therefore alliance amp leicesters dominance of this award is testament to the easily understood good value range of current account products offered by the bank
1378728 the bank has performed consistently well in our surveys and best buy tables and the judges are delighted to recognise the banks excellence by awarding it best business current account provider for an unprecedented sixth successive year
1378729 we are delighted to have been named the best business current account provider for a record sixth year and it highlights our position as a credible alternative to the traditional business banks
1378730 in 2007 nearly 34 000 businesses chose to open a business current account with alliance amp leicester commercial bank and many of these switched and have benefited from substantially lower banking costs
1378731 our research shows that small businesses are losing out on 500 million a year by remaining in uncompetitive business banking deals so it is encouraging that more and more businesses are waking up to the fact that not all business current accounts are the same
1378732 on rate alone barclays is the clear leader with its 6 5 per cent tax haven isa but as ever savers need to look at the whole package for savers with previous sums to transfer they will be better off with the direct isas from alliance amp leicester or abbey at 6 25 per cent the barclays isa doesnt allow transfers in and many savers get caught out by this type of thing if they ignore the terms and conditions
1378733 with alliance amp leicester only savers that open its premier current account can access the isa
1378734 the high savings deposits in january represent another excellent month for building societies
1378735 the uncertainty in the markets underlines why building societies are so important
1378736 sustainable successful business model produced a 10 increase in pre tax profits a 13 rise in assets
1378737 strong balance sheet was underpinned by record levels of savings inflows
1378738 our latest saving britain report shows a slight increase in the number of people saving which is encouraging however we would urge savers to keep an eye on how much they are dipping into their accounts and remain vigilant about their overall savings balance
1378739 we recommend that savers have the equivalent of at least three months salary in their savings accounts it is important to top those savings back up and make sure theyre in an account which gives the right balance of access and interest rate
1378740 a blatant mismatch between the contractual obligations and the actual management of the portfolio by ubs
1378741 reprice its whole mortgage range to an uncompetitive position compared with the rest of the market
1378742 an attempt to stave off taking on any new mortgage business
1378743 it is worryingly clear from the research that the vast majority of uk adults are deeply concerned about their finances with rising levels of debt and inadequate saving provisions responsible for countless sleepless nights nationwide
1378744 money cant buy you love but it can help to ease the burden as pay day gets further away and the bills start rolling in were not suggesting that money will ever replace the warm glow we feel from our loved ones but if you cant be with the one you love then learn to love your wallet
1378745 average rates on savings have rocketed as finance firms try to raise cash after the money markets seized up
1378746 if you have a that pays less than the base rate you should take your business elsewhere and fast
1378747 a cut would have been a welcome boost for homeowners especially first time buyers and would have helped offset the rises in tracker rates which have been occurring regularly over the past few weeks as lenders fight to increase their margins
1378748 however the bank is also concerned by inflation and had already warned in februarys inflation report that there may not be room for many more cuts in order to keep this in check with this in mind and the prospect of further rate rises among lenders fixed rate products could prove attractive at present
1378749 global and domestic economic circumstances have deteriorated since the february meeting and we believe that there is a clear need for a further cut in rates to five per cent
1378750 inflation remains a danger and the bank of england must of course act with caution however the threats to growth are more urgent at present and preventing a downturn must be the top priority in the near future
1378751 the benefits packages on these accounts vary from bank to bank and also by how much you pay each month
1378752 these benefits can be quite attractive but only if you take full advantage of them so make sure you register for them and make sure they fully meet your needs how beneficial is car breakdown cover if it only covers you on a limited distance from your home alternatively how often do you lose your mobile phone
1378753 by transferring to one of the best buy current accounts you could not only save up to 300 through not paying the fee
1378754 will more than likely pay the cost of buying some of these benefits independently
1378755 it is crucial that we do not have a taxpayer funded institution competing for retail deposits with institutions that have not failed or needed government support
1378756 the governments retrograde decision to nationalise northern rock is inconsistent with eu subsidy regulations
1378757 it also begs a couple of other questions why should anyone have deposits with any other bank other than northern rock as it is guaranteed by hm treasury and thus why save with national savings and investments
1378758 temporary period of public ownership better meets the governments objective of protecting taxpayers
1378759 i dont really believe in online dating but i figured ill try it anyway
1378760 if you can organize your thoughts enough to explain something to someone and then write that down in simple step by step terms you too can be a how to author
1378761 the rights issue we have announced today will strengthen our financial standing reinforcing our position as one of the better capitalised banks in the uk the improved financial strength will ensure we are even better placed to pursue our strategy of providing high quality savings and mortgage products in a competitive market
1378762 although the offer is fully underwritten we are still concerned about their exposure to the buy to let mortgage market
1378763 we are asking investors to consider how much of a long term premium there is to be had from the rights issue considering the company is not looking to raise a huge amount of money here and given that we are still awaiting further news on a hinted 82million write down
1378764 we parent like tarzan on a rope wildly swinging from never being there enough to being there far too much
1378765 it is a predicament for these professional middle class parents who have gone after what they have wanted career money happiness sometimes at the expense of their childrens well being and yet who also act as if the sky is the limit for their children
1378766 worrying about our children not liking us if we discipline them can prevent some parents from establishing firm structures for behaviour that our children need we must stop abdicating the throne and accept our position as an adult
1378767 children do not do well with deposed kings and queens for parents to be good parents we definitely must give generously of ourselves but never give ourselves over to our children
1378768 those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
1378769 the details show few redeeming features eight of the 11 main categories contributed to the increase in the annual headline rate
1378770 the only significant negative contributions were from clothing footwear and transport the latter mainly reflecting an erratic fall in air fares
1378771 this was at the top end of economists expectations but now looks plausible if retail energy prices are hiked by a further 20 per cent later this year as widely expected
1378772 the pound in our pockets is shrinking twice as quickly at 8 per cent a year
1378773 the erosion of the amount of money we save each year strongly suggests the true rate of inflation is gradually crippling household budgets
1378774 the gap between what we earn and what we spend means we have less money to put away but as the hole turns into a chasm we are required to patch up the deficit with money previously salted away however a point is reached when the gulf cant be bridged
1378775 while the games not over were now on the penalty spot ready to shoot a goal
1378776 this is a real vindication of everything the bank charge reclaimers have been saying
1378777 we have fees free banking while in credit ask most people with overdrafts if their bank is free and theyll think youre having a laugh
1378778 a fraction of their write offs due to the credit crunch
1378779 the second half of 2007 was as hard a six month period as i can remember and conditions in some markets in 2008 have remained difficult
1378780 but we must maintain a sense of perspective interest rates are moving lower employment is high world economic growth this year will be between three and four per cent again governments and central banks around the world are showing their determination to help the financial system recover
1378781 im disappointed that our stock price performance has been poor over the last twelve months we cant control the price at which the stock trades but that doesnt prevent me empathising with shareholders
1378782 we must create the conditions in which the stock price can move ahead again and concentrate on what we can control which is the profit performance of the group
1378783 todays ruling which found in favour of the office of fair trading is a great result for the consumer
1378784 there is still some way to go before the issue is put to rest and customers are free to reclaim the millions of pounds which they have paid in bank charges over the last six years as the banks involved in the test case may appeal against the decision but we are confident that sooner or later the consumer will come out on top
1378785 those who have been campaigning for change to the bank charge system will feel vindicated by the courts decision today as a victory for consumer rights
1378786 with the current volatility of the stock market people are understandably wary about risking their hard earned savings in direct investments but they still want their money to be working as hard as it can for them
1378787 our five year savings bond provides savers with the security they need now but still gives them the opportunity to make good returns in the future post office fiveyear saver is a secure investment which gives customers a guaranteed return while still offering the growth potential of the ftse 100 index
1378788 premier regular saver is a fantastic incentive for people to kick start a savings habit and at the end of the 12 month period they will have saved up a nice little nest egg
1378789 from recent research we know businesses are missing out on more than 500 million each year in extra credit interest which highlights the importance of businesses researching the market to ensure they are receiving a competitive return
1378790 whilst the future seems as difficult as ever to predict it is clear that we enter 2008 with real momentum behind our organic growth and with our product range distribution capabilities and customer franchises materially enhanced
1378791 coupled with our greater presence in the worlds largest and fastest growing economies there is much to be done but a confidence that it will be to the benefit of our shareholders our customers and our employees
1378792 the first quarter of 2008 has seen excellent growth in our retail deposit base
1378793 this is a difficult time for the financial services industry and it has presented us with specific challenges central to these has been the question of our capital ratios which have been the focus of much attention both internal and external over recent months
1378794 in discussions with shareholders it was clear that many of them had reached a similar conclusion hence todays announcement that we are launching a rights issue to re position capital ratios and strengthen our capital base
1378795 naturally shareholders wish to understand what we have assumed in relation to the prospects for further write downs and disposals of non core assets and todays announcement seeks to clarify the basis of our capital planning
1378796 i have no doubt that it coming probably in six to 12 months time
1378797 the results from our research show how popular the internet is for research people are using it as a reliable tool in their decision making about important and complicated issues such as financial products and services
1378798 it is not surprising that people are going online for financial information sites like fairinvestment co uk give free impartial information on things like insurance through the most recent and up to date news comparison tools and reviews
1378799 the internet provides a quick and convenient way for people to become self informed in areas such as personal finance where there is access to up to date rates news and content
1378800 we were shocked to see that such a high proportion of savers dont have an isa account
1378801 anyone with any amount of savings should grab an isa as soon as possible to make sure they get the most benefit of the tax free allowance
1378802 more decisive action is needed to tackle liquidity in the wholesale markets
1378803 pressure has been building and building on the bank of england to reduce interest rates as the economic picture deteriorates and property prices fall
1378804 despite our best intentions its often difficult to estimate food consumption but doing so helps prevent waste both in terms of food and money saving an extra few pounds on the weekly shop can go a long way especially when people are already feeling stretched
1378805 while current elevated inflation pressures mean that the bank of england has to tread very carefully we believe that the monetary policy committee will decide that increased downside risks to the growth outlook warrant further preventative action and will cut interest rates down from 5 25 per cent to 5 00 per cent
1378806 inflation risks also mean that if the mpc do act the interest rate cut will be no more than 25 base points from 5 25 per cent to 5 per cent in contrast to the aggressive cutting of interest rates that recently has been carried out by the federal reserve in the united states
1378807 we believe that the increased downside risks to growth stemming from tighter credit conditions coupled with signs that the economic downturn could be deepening will lead the mpc to cut interest rates from 5
1378808 this decision must have been one of the toughest the monetary policy committee has faced for a while
1378809 if the mpc had kept rates on hold it would have left the economy exposed to a slowdown
1378810 but by cutting rates it has left inflation free to rise even further beyond its target
1378811 slowing economic growth particularly shown by survey indicators of output and a weaker housing market will have played a part in the decision the reduction should help to bolster consumer confidence at a time of continued uncertainty
1378812 despite todays cut the impact on borrowers will be minimal current credit conditions have resulted in more tiered pricing for mortgages which means that anyone with less than a 25 per cent deposit is facing a higher rate than they would have done over the past six months
1378813 whilst lenders actively make it more difficult and more expensive to take out a mortgage the ripple effect on fixed rates resulting from a change in the base rate is limited in fact fixed rates are more in line with libor the inter bank lending rate which remains three quarters of a percent above base rate
1378814 while the turmoil had its epicentre in the united states sub prime housing market it is seen as the abrupt end of a more general boom in credit expansion
1378815 the bank is continuing to work with the relevant parties to develop approaches that will help to ease the strains and act as a bridge to a more normal outcome
1378816 at root the problem is one of a lack of trust in a context of incomplete information about the scale and distribution of the likely losses associated with mortgages other loans and derivative products
1378817 the reduction in the availability of funds seems likely to keep activity subdued and put further downward pressure on house prices relative to earnings though it is difficult to say just how far adjustment will go and how fast it will be
1378818 we now expect global growth will slow to 3 7 per cent in 2008 that is half a percentage point lower than our january quarterly update forecast and well below the 4 9 per cent growth seen in 2007
1378819 quickly spread from the u s sub prime sector to core parts of the financial system
1378820 the imf has downrated every countrys growth forecast in the light of whats been happening in the world economy however they have lowered their expectations in relation to us by less than other countries
1378821 our central projection is for inflation to fall back towards the 2 target
1378822 the time lag between changes in interest rates and their impact on inflation means that the mpc can have little effect on the short term path of inflation
1378823 a further bank rate cut would not normally be expected in an environment of improved growth expectations combined with inflation climbing to 1 over target
1378824 however cash strapped homeowners will be relieved to know that some relief to their purse strings may still be due as mortgage lenders own cost of borrowing is high and a further bank rate cut may be used to relieve this
1378825 having enjoyed two years of strong growth we are now living in uncertain times we are facing a financial shock on a scale not experienced in recent times which is coming on top of already slower growth
1378826 the uk economy is being buffeted by some strong headwinds with the prolonged troubles in the financial markets making for a bumpier ride both this year and next
1378827 high commodity prices are adding to inflationary pressures and significantly squeezing household incomes and some households are feeling a chill from the credit freeze with lending conditions becoming tighter
1378828 when the going gets tough the tough get going and its reassuring to see that most of us are going to great lengths to cut non essential spending from our budgets
1378829 the 2007 results reflect the impact of deteriorating market conditions and the liquidity and funding constraints experienced in the second half of the year by the company
1378830 the boards and managements of regulated firms carry the primary responsibility for ensuring their institutions financial soundness
1378831 the financial crisis has moved into a new and different phase
1378832 our central projection in february was for economic activity to slow quite sharply this year as the world economy turns down and credit becomes less widely available
1378833 unsurprisingly the personal loan market has not escaped the effects of the credit crunch in 2008 alone we have seen 27 changes to personal loan products
1378834 over the last year we have seen lenders reassessing how they offer personal loans too with more and more lenders adopting personal pricing or a credit rating assessment
1378835 this amendment is yet another sign that we are all too dependant on borrowing and are willing to accept a higher rate to ensure we get the funds
1378836 the heart of the problem is not in the real economy it is in the financial sector itself
1378837 gives strong commitments that banks will lend responsibly and will help customers who may be heading towards financial difficulties the long consultation process now complete has shown clearly what customers want and expect from their banks that has been the driver for these changes
1378838 reviewing the longer term interaction between itself and the banking codes
1378839 will work closely with the oft fsa and the treasury on these reviews including bringing about an over arching application of appropriate fairness principles to all aspects of retail as soon as possible
1378840 providers will still not immediately inform customers when they introduce new savings products the same as those currently held by their customers but with higher rates
1378841 our research shows that millions of people are missing out on their savings and have to live without the security of having a savings safety net if ever they found themselves in financial trouble
1378842 in times of economic uncertainty it is more important than ever to try and put money away our advice is try and keep saving regularly even if it is just a small amount and consider saving less frequently such as every other month
1378843 in times like now people need to be confident that their savings are in a safe place with a provider they can trust anyone who feels jittery about saving and wants peace of mind should look for a provider that offers them convenient and instant access to their money
1378844 certain life stages such as having a baby mean that we occasionally need a cash injection financially a new baby can cause havoc because of the combined burden of extra costs and reduced income this is where a little bit of financial planning can go a long way ensuring new mums can enjoy being new mums without having to worry about money matters
1378845 parents with children aged between five and 13 could still have enough time to stop a potential financial train crash heading towards them for example by saving on a regular basis over the long term
1378846 they have been given the catalyst to help them save and by engaging now and saving a little often they could help to avoid the financial conundrums being faced by the parents of todays young adults
1378847 what one thing do you like most about mambino organics products
1378848 the lord be exalted who delights in the well being of his servant
1378849 with more and more people seeking a fresh start abroad ensuring your finances are best placed to make the most of your new life should be a key factor when it comes to planning your move whether youre relocating for work retiring or looking to create a new life for you and your family
1378850 as well as offering very competitive rates speedy transfers and 24 hour access to your finances wherever you are the offshore banking and savings market now offers many of the online facilities available from onshore counterparts which means that you and your finances can reap the benefits of making a fresh start together
1378851 this is good news for the quarter of uk borrowers on tracker rates who will see an imminent reduction in rates
1378852 however borrowers should not expect that a base rate reduction will automatically result in a cut in standard variable rates or discounted rates across the market
1378853 lenders rate setting policies are more complex than simply the level of the base rate
1378854 they are determined by a range of factors including the cost of retail funding and the cost and availability of wholesale funding
1378855 the bad news for the uks mortgage borrowers is that bank rate cuts have increasingly less of an influence on their pockets at least in the short term fixed rate mortgage lenders performing a double whammy in choosing not to pass on the bank rate cut in full on their standard variable rate and also increasing the margin over bank rate on their new tracker mortgages this cut will have limited impact
1378856 despite the latest cut in base rate the second in the last three months fierce competition within the market and particularly the battle for best buy recognition means that savers have the opportunity to grab some great deals at the moment
1378857 even if you take into account that some of these institutions have not yet announced their rate decisions post base rate a drop of 0 25 per cent will still leave them well in excess of those on offer last february
1378858 if you dont need to have access to your savings for a while fixed rate savings bonds also offer good value at present and once youve signed up you will not be impacted by the further anticipated downward fluctuations in base rate
1378859 from rushing down our meals to squeezing love making into the shortest possible time frame we seem to now be racing through life at a crazy pace
1378860 the question we have to ask ourselves is where is this going to end
1378861 in the united kingdom credit conditions for households and businesses are tightening
1378862 the mpcs decision will come as a relief to many
1378863 a lot of people are facing higher living costs and business expenses so the rate cut is an important step towards easing financial strain
1378864 there is no point slashing rates if lenders decide to stick to existing rates
1378865 many companies are currently actively encouraging people to transact with them online but they need to ensure that this is what their customers really want
1378866 it is important for companies to embrace the breadth of communication channels available and offer their customers a choice companies that scrap paper communications without asking their customers first will lose a significant number of them to rivals
1378867 largely due to powers that the bank of england has taken as part of its secured lending facility arrangements through covenants in the loan agreements
1378868 the exact impact of northern rock plcs inclusion in public sector net debt cannot be stated at this time because it was not possible to collect the relevant data from northern rock plc in advance of this announcement and it would have involved disclosing commercially sensitive information
1378869 we have made a proposal that seeks to stabilise the company and rebuild it as a trusted and thriving institution under the virgin brand with a long term future the proposal is a sound public private solution for northern rock that will see taxpayers interests protected and give existing shareholders the opportunity to invest alongside and at the same subscription price as the virgin consortium
1378870 while many people in britain may be finding life a little tougher this january compared to last it is even more important that those with savings are on the lookout for savings accounts that make their money work the hardest for them
1378871 2007 was dubbed the year of the saver as the competition in the savings market really hotted up however we predict that 2008 will also lend itself well to savers we advise savvy savers to keep an eye on such accounts to make sure they are getting the best rate available
1378872 we recommend that savers should have the equivalent of three months salary in their in order to account for any financial emergencies that could arise
1378873 the highest loan to value areas are likely to be those most vulnerable to house price falls as they will see negative equity emerge more rapidly
1378874 we believe we will create a very strong bank in the future and we hope to make sure the taxpayers will get all their money paid back
1378875 despite working intensively we have been unable to formulate a value creation proposal which meets our investment criteria whilst also respecting hm governments proposed financing terms and the interests of other stakeholders in the company
1378876 many companies are currently actively encouraging people to transact with them online but they need to ensure that this is what their customers really want
1378877 it is important for companies to embrace the breadth of communication channels available and offer their customers a choice companies that scrap paper communications without asking their customers first will lose a significant number of them to rivals
1378878 a quarter point rate cut on thursday looks pretty much a done deal in the face of tightening credit conditions further rate cuts are on the cards but not until more concrete evidence of a slowdown emerges
1378879 it should not be assumed that such a rate cut will automatically be forthcoming lenders rate setting decisions will depend on their funding costs and not simply the level of the bank base rate
1378880 the reality is that contractually lenders retain the right to widen or narrow their margins and are free to do so at different times in the economic cycle unless a borrower has a loan that tracks a particular rate
1378881 market commentators had considered the decision to be a difficult one
1378882 there have recently been further signs of slowing output growth and one monetary policy committee mpc member voted for a larger reduction in rates than the 0 25 per cent cut last month
1378883 against this inflation is currently at 2 5 per cent and is expected to rise further in the coming months while measures of inflationary expectations have been rising
1378884 in light of huge increases in pipeline inflation and reports of rising prices in many sectors the mpc have chosen to maintain a gradual approach to monetary easing avoiding back to back cuts for fear of de anchoring inflation expectations nevertheless with risks to economy still focused on the downside the market is still pricing in further cuts in the months ahead
1378885 its just a matter of time before the next quarter point cut and the summer of discontent for borrowers continues lenders are still being very cautious and favouring direct lending whilst brokers continue to tear their hair out
1378886 the market pendulum had swung too far one way with cheap and easy credit and then the crunch came along and made it swing too far the other way the last time the base rate was 5 per cent a typical two year fixed rate was 25 basis points lower now it is more like a 100 basis points higher we look forward to a happy equilibrium but that is unlikely to be this year
1378887 in recent months its actually the rate of libor that banks have been most concerned about so movements in the base rate arent as important as they used to be
1378888 recent economic figures confirm the uk economy is slowing down
1378889 boni dia 17 de mar o vai completar um ano da morte do meu pai d pra globo mandar fazer uma missa colocar no jornal nacional s pra n o passar em branco o primeiro ano da morte dele n o claro que n o seu pai era um homem alegre a gente tem que se lembrar dele com alegria dia 17 que dia quarta feira quarta feira dia do chico city voc s s o t o amigos pede pro chico ceder um bloco do programa dele e voc faz a pra a nesse espa o
1378890 for the majority of members despite some differences in their assessments of the risks the balance of risks had not changed sufficiently to merit a change in bank rate this month
1378891 the committee would continue to review the balance of risks to inflation and its implications for the appropriate level of bank rate as it received new information each month about the economic outlook and the uncertainties around it
1378892 increased the downside risk to uk growth in the short term and to inflation further out
1378893 sentiment in international credit and money markets appeared to have deteriorated over the month
1378894 even by the age of seven children are aware of the impact of money in their lives learning how to respect and manage money in their early years will give them the confidence to make responsible financial decisions as adults
1378895 giving young children a basic framework for making financial decisions and realising what those decisions will mean is the first step towards digging the foundations of long term prosperity
1378896 the earlier young people learn about managing money the easier it is for them when they become adults
1378897 also along with personalising their ringtones facebook pages and clothes now they can show their individuality by putting a favourite image on their bankcard making having a current account more fun
1378898 the most severe challenge to uk financial system for several decades
1378899 recent investors are relying on continued house price appreciation to earn positive returns
1378900 buy to let investors have often invested in new build flats in the united kingdom which have experienced much lower rates of price appreciation than houses
1378901 will consider carefully the design of its lending facilities in times of stress to maximise the chances of these being effective
1378902 exceptionally buoyant housing market had a number of side effects
1378903 the speed and ferocity with which that adjustment disrupted core markets and institutions internationally had not been anticipated by firms or authorities
1378904 a larger write down of these assets than initially anticipated
1378905 we expect market conditions for subprime mortgage related assets to continue to be uncertain and we are working to resolve the remaining impact
1378906 tighter and more expensive availability of credit following recent market turmoil will add further pressure in the absence of an interest rate cut
1378907 in light of recent guidance published by the fsa knight vinke asset management wishes to inform the market that it intends to engage in a constructive dialogue with the board and other institutional shareholders of hsbc holdings plc over the future direction and governance of the group
1378908 undertake a fundamental review of the groups strategy in consultation with shareholders
1378909 the september net receipts figure represents the highest monthly inflow that building societies have ever experienced this is more than double the amount deposited in august nearly three times the amount deposited in september last year and nearly 1billion higher than the previous record it is likely that a significant proportion of the inflow is due to withdrawals from northern rock bank being redeposited in building societies

1378914 equipped with such skills the number of people who find themselves facing unmanageable debt problems will reduce considerably
1378915 although the banks quarterly inflation report issued next week will give us the clearest idea of where rates are headed my message to borrowers in the meantime is be on your guard
1378916 ten years ago supermarkets started with store cards and quickly expanded into credit cards personal loans and savings accounts
1378917 today supermarkets are as clever at marketing travel insurance policies as they are at selling travel sweets
1378918 additionally with their low running costs supermarkets can easily undercut other providers they are already pinching customers from banks and in time could steal even more
1378919 it is reckoned that over 40 million adults in the uk have a current account
1378920 the uk base rate is now at its highest point since 2001 and our range of savings products reflects this
1378921 our gold and base rate tracker range of accounts are used by a wide range of customers around the world both as their main offshore banking facility and to supplement local transactional accounts
1378922 our internet banking service allows accounts such as gold and base rate tracker products to be operated 24 hours a day via the web both of these products offer an attractive mix of convenience and competitive interest rates
1378923 the interest rates for the gold account are tiered so the greater the balance the higher your gross interest rate will be
1378924 lenders do like that proven track record and it can be difficult to get going if youve just turned 18 or moved to the uk from overseas
1378925 some uncertainty about the level of funds which might be released by the scheme
1378926 we examine the governments proposals for disbursement including the local disbursement option for small building societies
1378927 disappointed at the lack of public consultation on the priorities for disbursement
1378928 our members are fully committed to working closely with the government to make the unclaimed assets scheme a success it will be for the government to ensure the money makes a positive difference in the community
1378929 our campaign has been very successful so far in reuniting customers with forgotten funds and we have only just started we expect to see much more success over the next year as the work of our search agents experian pays off
1378930 but its recommended that people have three months salary put aside in case of financial emergencies this equates to 5 899 for those on an average income
1378931 the insolvency figures released today again highlight the need to ensure people have sufficient financial skills to make informed financial decisions equipped with such skills the number of people who find themselves facing unmanageable debt problems will reduce considerably
1378932 as the 200 schools already offering a gcse equivalent in personal finance have shown students who take a standalone course in personal finance make positive changes to their financial behaviour and are able to manage their own finances effectively wed like to see every school offering their students the opportunity to gain these skills but achieving this requires government action
1378933 it is worrying that so many people are resorting to individual insolvencies be it an iva or bankruptcy to resolve their personal debt problems
1378934 we could well see the system prevalent in western europe north america and australia where there are a certain number of free transactions and then you pay for any additional ones
1378935 we have already seen some providers abandon the concept of free banking by steadily introducing a bevy of charges on their less profitable customers
1378936 hsbc and first direct both introduced a 10 monthly fee on certain accounts and hsbcs non premier account holders at its canford cliffs branch in dorset are paying a fee for counter services
1378937 the introduction of transaction charges would drastically affect consumer behaviour as it has done in other countries
1378938 with personal debt increasing by 1 million every four minutes in the uk and additional research showing that 4
1378939 we would advise consumers to be more realistic about what they can comfortably afford and ensure that if they do borrow money to fund a holiday they are fully aware of the repayment terms and are at ease with meeting these
1378940 people probably like to keep money in piggy banks and money boxes because they can visibly see how much money can be collected in a fairly short period of time and it gives them
1378941 but the clever thing to do is to convert loose pennies into pounds by transferring the money into a savings account which will pay you interest
1378942 worth about 8 billion in this years budget to keep public sector debt below the governments self imposed ceiling
1378943 financial markets remain under considerable stress and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households
1378944 the feds decision to slash rates doesnt change my view that a us recession is a probability this year nor will it prevent corporate profits from falling across the board i think central banks worldwide will continue to react to the severe slowdown by continuing to cut interest rates aggressively which is good news for government bonds and investment grade corporate bonds
1378945 the precipitous falls on world equity markets since the start of the year confirm what many of us have suspected for a while the credit crunch that began in the us sub prime mortgage market last summer is having a profound impact on the real global economy
1378946 so what should investors caught up in this maelstrom do my suggestion is that they do nothing history shows that this is usually the best course of action in such situations
1378947 all too often private investors are sucked into a market at its peak and then exit at the bottom tempting as it might be to withdraw money when markets drop sharply this merely crystallises an individuals losses
1378948 the case for easing has been greatly strengthened by the global disruption in global credit markets and in our own banking system which brings a risk of a deeper downturn
1378949 it is likely that a less buoyant housing market will go hand in hand with slower growth of consumer spending in the short run that will slow economic activity possibly quite sharply
1378950 the tripartite authorities reaffirmation that the existing guarantee arrangements for depositors remain in place
1378951 savers money remains safe and secure in northern rock the timescales indicated by the tripartite for the company to conclude the process remain consistent with the companys previous guidance for its strategic review process
1378952 the banks have always been firmly of the view that the fees they charge customers are fair and clear
1378953 if the banks lose the case it will almost certainly be the end to free banking in the uk because the banks will have to find alternative ways of earning money back from customers
1378954 if the banks lose this case we will go from a position of free current accounts to being charged for current accounts
1378955 weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth
1378956 the market has spoken to the fed and the fed has listened in the short term that may provide a fillip to equities and a relief to borrowers
1378957 however the move also smacks of panic it is an emergency cut as the meeting was not scheduled until the end of the month furthermore the cut suggests that the economy is already in dire straits and paradoxically confirms the markets worst fears
1378958 the us federal reserve has acted very aggressively in cutting interest rates by 0 75 per cent a week before the scheduled meeting this is the first time since 1984 that it has cut rates by 0 75 per cent in one go
1378959 pay close attention to their finances as far as banks are concerned the outcome of the court case may be one of heads i win tails you lose but vigilant customers can take proactive steps to ensure that banks never win regardless of which side the coin falls
1378960 needs to make it clear once and for all that consumers charges must be fair
1378961 we believe that its time that high street banks stop making easy money and take a responsible attitude to the impact of their actions on vulnerable consumers a charge of over 30 for an unpaid standing order is enough to trigger a spiral of debt that many people on low incomes may never fully recover from
1378962 there are many ways in which the consumer can do their bit against the threat of climate change
1378963 providers of green products such as car insurance and domestic energy sometimes charge more in order to cover the cost so it is up to the consumer to decide
1378964 but it is still possible to find competitive deals on green products without it costing the earth ethical investments for socially responsible investors who wish to avoid companies that have a negative impact on the environment or those who see the opportunity for growth in companies which practice ethical investment management or stand to benefit from developments in this area
1378965 the high court test case which is a key part of the investigation is seeking to establish the preliminary legal principle of whether the provisions of the ofts unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations that deal with unfairness apply
1378966 it is hoped that the case will start before the end of the week
1378967 we understand the conflict between slowing economic growth and rising inflationary pressures and the uncertainty over some of the data reflected in the split views of mpc members last month
1378968 however the mpc had an opportunity to act to anticipate the worsening economic environment today and it is disappointing that there has been no change
1378969 and housing market conditions will remain challenging for the rest of this year but the majority of existing borrowers are coping well anyone who is in financial difficulty or thinks they may have a problem in the future should contact their lender or a debt adviser
1378970 this decision must have been a tough call the threat of a steeper than expected slowdown could easily have swayed the mpc to cut but the very real prospect of accelerating inflation is likely to have been the deciding factor
1378971 the bank of england is now likely to hold out until the economic picture becomes clearer before deciding to cut rates again it will want more evidence that the economy is slowing more understanding of the effects of its recent efforts to revive credit markets and crucially a better view of whether rising commodity prices are pushing up consumer price inflation
1378972 rics is disappointed that the mpc chose to leave the base rate on hold today
1378973 housing transactions have collapsed consumer confidence has sunk to its lowest level since 1992 the service sector appears close to stagnation according to the latest cips survey and the retail sector is under immense pressure
1378974 rics believes that the bank should cut the base rate to 4 5 per cent in june if there is no improvement in the data over the next month
1378975 made a strong start to the year despite the turbulence in global financial markets
1378976 our performance so far in 2008 demonstrates that hsbcs business resilience in difficult financial markets our global distribution network diversified earnings streams and strong capital position are allowing us to support our customers in todays challenging market conditions
1378977 these factors enable us to invest for growth particularly in emerging markets and focus on long term value creation for our shareholders
1378978 i am encouraged by the way we have increased pre tax profits in every one of the major countries in which we operate in asia pacific the middle east and latin america also our global banking and markets business was more profitable than in the preceding two quarters on the back of strong emerging markets performance despite the write down of us 2 6 billion
1378979 commercial banking and private banking both had record quarters our consumer finance business in the us remains challenging but we are vigorously managing our costs and our risks and working hard to help our customers our strategy is clear and we are executing it ours is a business with excellent opportunities ahead
1378980 will set out the basis for the removal of government support through the creation of a smaller more focussed financially viable mortgage and savings bank which will be returned to the private sector
1378981 we have only northern rocks guarantee that they will not compete on an unfair basis this is not good enough and we will look for much more detail on this in the finalised business plan later this month
1378982 taxpayers deserve to see as much detail as possible about the plans of the bank that they own it is unacceptable for northern rock to build market share via a combination of artificially high interest rates and government guarantees to savers
1378983 hbos has a very strong business and rumours that it is on its last legs are ridiculous foolish rumours like these could cause panic among savers who should be reassured that hbos with its high interest savings and current accounts is a far better home for your money than under your mattress
1378984 there has been a series of completely unfounded rumours about uk financial institutions in the london market over the last few days sometimes accompanied by short selling
1378985 107 new technical tax proposals dont support the chancellors claims to be moving towards a simpler tax system
1378986 we welcome measures announced in the chancellors budget today to help new and growing businesses develop
1378987 changes to the small firms loan guarantee scheme as well as extensions to other business measures will make it simpler quicker and easier for firms to get credit and for banks to have a safety net when lending in that vital but volatile start up time
1378988 we are pleased the chancellor recognises the need for a competitive corporation tax regime to keep the uk at the forefront of global business and welcome any cuts to keep the uks tax burden low
1378989 up by 800 million as we head for a downturn its a crazy way to respond to a slowdown hitting the very people that create the wealth jobs and investment this country so badly needs
1378990 90 per cent will continue to pay capital gains tax at 10 per cent
1378991 it is frankly amazing that the chancellor has contrived to create a tax change that has caused howls of anguish from businesses and cries of derision from commentators but still allows hedge fund managers to pay lower rates of tax than their cleaners
1378992 its hugely disappointing that the chancellor has ignored the concerns and views of the industry and has instead chosen not to redress the imbalance of taxation of investments brought about by his changes to cgt
1378993 first time buyers may be more tempted to dip into their deposit savings this year because of the uncertainty in the market and prospect of falling house prices
1378994 however there are still very good reasons for people to get on the housing ladder as property continues to be a good investment for the longer term
1378995 while day to day living expenses prompted 53 per cent of people to dip into savings 50 per cent dipped into the deposit fund for a holiday and four per cent did so to pay for a wedding or other celebration
1378996 saving 23 000 or more for a deposit is no mean feat particularly if you let distractions get in your way but if youre single minded and set yourself a realistic savings target then you could find yourself making an offer on a house sooner than you think
1378997 we are pleased that the savings message is getting through and we are encouraged by the results that more people in the uk are today building up a nest egg
1378998 however we must urge savers to be careful about the amount of money they are taking out of their savings accounts the general rule of thumb is to have at least three months salary set aside in order to cope in the short term with any financial emergency that comes along
1378999 since the coordinated actions taken in december 2007 the g 10 central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures in funding markets
1379000 pressures in some of these markets have recently increased again we all continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address those liquidity pressures
1379001 as with the other liquidity measures introduced the new facility will not alleviate the current credit crunch or economic recession
1379002 along with other central banks the bank of england is closely monitoring market conditions
1379003 here is the proof that while the rest of the world is successfully educing the burden on families alistair darling and gordon brown are doing the exact opposite
1379004 as darling announces his first budget and consumers digest what emerges from the red brief case it is essential that they take into account the slump in disposable incomes and increasing levels of debt when considering future spending
1379005 the latest figures from philip hammond shadow treasury chief secretary reveal that the disposable income of the average working family has dropped from 26 200 in 2006 to 25 900 today whilst uk personal debt is growing and stood at 1 412bn at the end of january
1379006 in the current financial climate consumers may feel like they are being squeezed from all sides with growing mortgage repayments and increased taxes on alcohol and motoring
1379007 britain is better placed than other economies to withstand the slowdown in the global economy
1379008 there was little of immediate concrete substance for the housing or mortgage markets in this budget
1379009 while there may prove to be benefits in the long term the chancellor ducked the pressing nature of some of the issues that are facing the markets right here and now
1379010 the stamp duty thresholds have not kept pace with the increase in house prices for many years now stamp duty is hitting more homebuyers where it hurts in their pockets it is also becoming an issue again for first time buyers
1379011 the chancellor promised to put sustainability at the heart of todays announcement but he has merely tinkered in the margins
1379012 mr darling should have used this budget to tackle climate change the biggest challenge the world faces by making it cheaper and easier for people to go green including tax breaks for greening the home and grants for renewable energy
1379013 another freeze in fuel duty will further undermine the governments already weak green credentials
1379014 the cost of motoring has fallen over the past 10 years and carbon emissions from road transport have risen raising fuel duty would encourage people to choose greener transport options and the money raised could have been used to cut taxes on people and jobs and helped to fund a range of green initiatives including better sustainable transport options
1379015 help people cut their carbon emissions and their fuel bills
1379016 help us support peoples aspiration to own their own homes and ensure communities are built in a way that will protect the environment for future generations
1379017 we also need to look at what we should be doing to tackle carbon emissions from the rest of our buildings our offices shops and pubs
1379018 shows how the government continues to put weight behind targeted environmental issues through selected fiscal measures
1379019 the focus on voluntary action still remains actual measures were less aggressive than we had been led to expect from the build up
1379020 the decision to release equity from your home is a big one and we would recommend anybody considering it to take specialist financial advice
1379021 a quick determination of this point of principle will assist in securing a clear and orderly resolution of the fairness of these charges
1379022 the oft will continue to work closely with the financial ombudsman service and the financial services authority in addition to consulting with banks and consumer groups
1379023 the banks have always been firmly of the view that the fees they charge customers are fair and clear the court case will clarify these points and provide certainty for customers and banks alike
1379024 this is great news for members of both nationwide and portman
1379025 i have heard that some banks are refusing to deal with credit card refunds it seems to me that the banks are determined to muddy the waters as much as possible in all these areas as it discourages consumers from taking action but we have been settling a number of these claims proving that customers who have been subjected to unfair credit card charges can get their money back
1379026 this partnership will draw upon capitas expertise across both the life and pensions and unit trust administration markets through both capita life amp pensions and capita financial group an integrated operating infrastructure will deliver cost and quality benefits alongside enhanced customer service and provide a flexible platform for ciss current and new business
1379027 i am confident that this partnership with capita will provide our staff with increased opportunity for future development within a number of different sectors over the last three years the change programme undertaken within cis has delivered significant customer and business benefits ahead of schedule
1379028 if people dont feel they are in control of it that affects first of all their general wellbeing and happiness and over time it can get worse than that it can lead to stress and economic costs for the company
1379029 the upcoming strike will hit small firms the hardest as many of them rely on royal mail to do business and lose significant sums every time the post is held up
1379030 at fairinvestment co uk we have seen a significant increase in visitors to our online banking pages since the postal strikes
1379031 online banking has become increasingly popular as more and more people realise the advantages particularly in the light of the national strikes
1379032 not only is it reliable but security has been significantly improved in recent years it also makes complete sense you can check all your accounts pay your bills and transfer funds without leaving the house
1379033 entitled to claim against the company and will receive a dividend when one is paid
1379034 these are extremely encouraging figures as young people are key contributors towards uk businesses and the economy
1379035 young people can bring sky high levels of ambition and out of the box creative thinking characteristics we have found to be perceived as critical to entrepreneurial success
1379036 we welcome changes where charges are reduced and easier to understand but we suspect some banks may be trying to muddy the waters ahead of their date in the high court with the office of fair trading
1379037 for most of us worries about money go out of the window with the joy of having a baby its hard enough coping with the sleepless nights and new responsibilities without thinking about budgets
1379038 but financially a new baby can cause havoc because of the combined burden of extra costs and reduced income
1379039 if money is already tight its no wonder that so many families have had to turn to borrowing to make ends meet there are obviously increased costs so debt is often a sensible way to tide you over
1379040 however the most important thing under those circumstances is that you choose the most appropriate form of borrowing for you
1379041 to choose between their own financial security and bailing their children out
1379042 could be misguided and lead to serious problems for families in years to come
1379043 this is something that many young people just dont think about but they need to start taking action now and avoid any further delay
1379044 twenty somethings are at the ideal age to start saving
1379045 while uk firms are clearly concerned about the possible wider implications of the credit market turmoil such bullish results suggest there is no evidence of any impact on their day to day business activities
1379046 to maintain trust in the financial system consumers want to be sure that they will be able to get their money back in a timely fashion if a bank were to run into problems
1379047 they also want to know that they will continue to have access to day to day banking services with strong safeguards in place at least until they can transfer services in an orderly way
1379048 it is in all our interests that the framework for depositor protection delivers an orderly and transparent process with a better protection scheme as its foundation
1379049 in 2007 we are seeing the emergence of a generation of women who are better educated more ambitious and more financially confident than any before them this generation is already more likely to handle day to day financial matters than their male partners and demands to have at least an equal say in the big decisions
1379050 the delaying tactic is incredibly sneaky by holding off the rate change providers are avoiding paying out a whopping 6 million per day in interest
1379051 the good news from these results is that many britons actually find saving as part of their day to day lives relatively easy
1379052 happiness certainly doesnt come cheap with the average brit spending almost half of their annual wage on pursuits that make them happy we place a high value on our leisure time
1379053 it has been 12 months since the bank of england started to put rates up after a year long run of maintaining them at 4 50 with rates now more than one per cent higher than this time last year this pause will come as a welcome break for homeowners and borrowers
1379054 even though we have now seen five base rate rises in the last year many savers are unaware they arent receiving the full benefit of these increases a further base rate increase is expected this year so savers must make sure they are with a provider that will pass on any increases
1379055 the majority of people are not planning for their christmas expenditure even though they have a good idea of how much it is likely to cost
1379056 parents are understandably nervous about picking up the bill for their childrens fortnightly holiday excesses one way to help with budgeting is not to send them away with too much cash which is a temptation
1379057 although the over 50s have been one of the most successful generations many people need to save more to achieve a good retirement
1379058 we are very elated there is some justice in the world
1379059 its not the money its the sense of achievement getting something back that was taken from you im so happy
1379060 customers who have been stung by unfair bank charges should ignore the fsas decision to grant waiver to firms on complaint handling in fact they should proceed with reclaiming penal bank fees without delay
1379061 the fsas decision plays directly into the hands of banks which stand to benefit from any hold up because we can reclaim unfair fees as far back as six years only
1379062 in order to stop the clock customers must issue their claims even if the small claims courts refuse to deal with them immediately
1379063 the account has to offer a form of management that you are both comfortable and experienced with
1379064 as you close down one avenue for the fraudsters we know that theyre not going to pack up shop and get legitimate jobs theyre going to look for other areas to exploit
1379065 these results are worrying young people may feel they cant afford to save but they cant afford not to
1379066 the collapse of farepak was dreadful for the thousands of people who lost money
1379067 the government is working hard to prevent other families suffering similar problems in the future
1379068 we initiated a comprehensive investigation to establish the facts we are now getting legal advice on whether there are grounds for further action
1379069 there is an obvious inequality between the protection given to people who save with high street banks and those who put their money into schemes such as farepak
1379070 we are pleased that a decision from the initial stage of the test case has been reached as it takes us closer to getting clarity for our customers
1379071 for the time being at least the nice decade is behind us
1379072 the real stability upon which economic prosperity is founded requires that inflation remain low and stable for a long period of time
1379073 inflation will return to the target and growth will eventually recover to a sustainable rate
1379074 coulter is certainly one impressive looking dude with arms that were busting out of his jersey
1379075 will not address whether terms and conditions or specific charges of individual banks are unfair
1379076 analyse information supplied by the banks and further information on the investigation into unfairness will be published after the judgment has been delivered and oft has had time to consider any implications
1379077 quel dito te lo infilo in un altro buco e te lo faccio uscire dal naso
1379078 eh si mica scema si fatta lorenzo crespi e ettore bassi cio nel senso
1379079 what do we do with the michigan and florida delegates
1379080 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
1379081 in terms of access to financial services no one should be disadvantaged by where they live
1379082 we are also calling on communities themselves to come forward with examples of successful locally developed solutions so these can be shared more widely
1379083 we really do urge you to try and commit them to memory rather than write them down otherwise its like signing a blank cheque for fraudsters
1379084 the banks are starting to pre empt the oft by softening their terms and conditions but the oft mustnt view this as an early victory
1379085 the only way customers can achieve a satisfactory long term conclusion is by the oft going to court an out of court agreement between the oft and the banks will only leave the waters muddy for the millions of customers reclaiming bank charges
1379086 the account will be available for a limited period only and i would urge savers to take up this opportunity without delay
1379087 i think on the contrary it sort of suggests that what the bank of england has done and the measures it has taken have been effective in ensuring that the banks dont need to take this emergency funding
1379088 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses that doesnt mean there isnt room for great licenses weve had a 20 year partnership with the nfl were incredibly proud of that a 15 ish year partnership with the nba nhl etc but also we partner with j k rowling and warner brothers in bringing over the harry potter games to market and a great partnership with hasbro a lot of new stuff this year for the more casual consumer theres room for both i think what youre noticing is that in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1379089 they widely seem to agree with the prevailing view in financial markets that at least one more hike is on the horizon
1379090 with some long term financial planning and if its at all possible saving for your children from an early age can give them a financial head start in life
1379091 we want to help re unite as many people as possible with savings they have forgotten they had invested with ns amp i or as we were formerly known national savings we have launched an advertising campaign to jog as many memories as possible and the service is completely free of charge
1379092 they should always accept that the shares can go up or down
1379093 this reorganisation underpins and supports the fsas determination to enhance its delivery
1379094 while secrecy between partners may not be particularly healthy it is a good idea to maintain some financial independence as you never know what will happen in the future
1379095 keep some savings aside for yourself and put a bit away for a rainy day and try not to depend too much financially on your partner or family if youre unclear what to do about joint accounts and private savings its best to seek professional financial advice to help work out the best way to save for you
1379096 well on course to becoming the richest former prime minister in history
1379097 given the uncertainty over the extent of the economic slowdown the mpc was right to resist cutting interest rates today
1379098 the bank of englands february inflation report will provide a good opportunity to explain their strategy in greater detail in particular their thoughts on the global economy and near term inflation pressures
1379099 tracker mortgages are by far the most attractive proposition in 2008
1379100 the decision to take out a tracker should only be made if borrowers are confident that they could withstand a further increase in rates which is not out of the question over the next two years
1379101 first time buyers looking for a mortgage deal should consider taking out a fixed rate mortgage which will give them the security of fixed monthly payments a tracker mortgage is a good option for homeowners who are financially flexible and looking to take advantage of any further interest rate cuts during the next 12 months
1379102 i believe interest rates will continue to fall globally to boost sluggish economic growth after two years of looking unattractive higher rated corporate bonds now look excellent value says m amp gs richard woolnough
1379103 however i am still avoiding poorer rated investment grade corporate bonds and particularly high yield bonds because spreads the excess yield over that of government bonds are still very tight on a historical basis
1379104 the northern rock factor has badly dented the uks reputation for being the worlds pre eminent financial centre
1379105 i have never known such a palaver about nothing the fact is we happily hand over cheques to all sorts of unsavoury people all day long without a moments thought we have nothing to fear
1379106 the uk retail banking market performs well in many dimensions especially relative to international norms however the issue of bank current account charges is a matter of real concern to the banks customers and raises wider questions about competition and transparency of pricing
1379107 the initial scoping work we have undertaken has demonstrated to us that this is not only an issue for those people who are being charged but also for customers who are not defaulting on their bank accounts
1379108 it is always a good idea to consider alternatives before taking out a loan if you have some savings then dipping into your nest egg is likely to cost less than borrowing money even if it is a low cost loan
1379109 additionally delaying your purchase and putting away some spare cash is bound to work out cheaper in the long run borrowing money may seem like a convenient way to plug a hole in your spending plans but a hole in your budget may be a sign of deeper problems that can often be solved not by increasing net borrowing but by cutting gross spending
1379110 some people like to pay their bills in the middle of the night and they certainly like the freedom that gives them
1379111 you can do it from an internet cafe when youre sitting in rome so people like that flexibility
1379112 its no surprise so many people are permanently in the red with interest rates having risen five times in the past year consumers are no doubt feeling the squeeze
1379113 your overdraft can be a murky place to reside especially if you are close to the edge of the authorised limit
1379114 it helps them manage their money a little better particularly when they are living busy lives and they havent got time to check up on their banking every ten minutes
1379115 the mobile phone is something which we carry around with us
1379116 a customer switching to a top rated account and keeping a steady balance of 2 500 deposited throughout the year will indeed earn a good rate of interest
1379117 on the whole youll get better advice from an independent financial adviser as youll have more choice but be clear about the advice you need contact at least three advisers and check their qualifications and charges up front
1379118 first directs decision to scrap interest on its current account might look like a bold move but millions of us currently earn next to nothing in interest so its not quite as revolutionary as it might seem
1379119 the choices in the current account market are becoming clearer with banks being forced to stake out definite positions and compete for business
1379120 it is important to learn how to budget and how to use credit responsibly
1379121 this might well be a temporary position but i think it shows the importance of rebuilding consumer confidence i dont think this is going to go away for a while though
1379122 it is clear that millions of people are worried about data security and want organisations large or small and public or private to take action
1379123 there are certainly cases where people pay back not just everything they owe but more than they owe through an iva because they have the money and the assets
1379124 under this scheme they want to do it like they do in the us and actually return money to savers after a few days
1379125 more people than ever are tracking down forgotten funds in dormant accounts even if youve forgotten the money its still yours
1379126 it doesnt matter how old the account is how little money is in it or even if the branch or bank has closed
1379127 this survey highlights what many bosses have probably suspected for a long time that for some employees their current job is the last thing on their mind when they are at work
1379128 however whilst they may be wasting their employers time they are not necessarily being idle as they are planning for their own future for budding entrepreneurs the routine of their day job can spark dreams of going onto bigger and better things
1379129 it is extremely encouraging to see that savvy consumers are taking advantage of the recent rate hikes with previously unseen record levels of savings now taking place
1379130 last quarter saw the savings brake ratio worryingly move back up above the 40 pence mark a consequence of paying off christmas debt so its with relief that we see it fall by a staggering 24 pence in q2 however we shouldnt take these figures for granted its important to note that personal debt in the uk continues to rise and as such uk consumers should continue to be savvy when it comes to saving and spending their money
1379131 we are always told that savings accounts are risk free but after northern rock many people are not too convinced about that
1379132 the northern rock crisis has been a massive shock to the system and has highlighted that the compensation scheme currently in place needs to be overhauled
1379133 customers definitely agree that the authorities need to act on increasing the level of guarantees in the event of a bank crash northern rock may have been a one off but people believe its better to be safe than sorry this poll shows many people are not convinced that the levels of protection currently in place are sufficient which explains why so many people dont trust the government to guarantee their savings at all
1379134 northern rock is solvent and with a sound long term loan book but has had short term liquidity difficulties
1379135 climate change has a significant potential impact on our business on the markets in which we operate and on the customers and clients we serve reducing our environmental impact is a business priority
1379136 our review found that the overall approach to carbon neutrality taken by barclays is sound and effective
1379137 the british bankers association is pleased the chancellor seems to have taken on board much of what the banking industry recommended we have been urging the government to bring a speedy resolution to the issues highlighted by northern rock
1379138 the payment myths report offers some interesting insights into payment behaviour amongst british consumers and looks to shed light on some common misconceptions
1379139 despite growing acceptance and familiarity with the variety of payment methods available to consumers today common stereotypes remain while new technology means we can now bank online 24 hours a day or have our groceries delivered with the click of a mouse traditional methods like cash and cheques continue to endure
1379140 signs of slowing growth in the industrial world were already apparent
1379141 had increased the downside risks to activity and inflation in the medium term
1379142 it is encouraging to see that recent market conditions have not dampened brits enthusiasm for saving
1379143 we have seen a lot of activity in the financial markets in the third quarter of 2007 which marked the beginning of the northern rock crisis
1379144 british business faces a tough time next year with the number of business failures set to reach levels not seen for five years
1379145 businesses in most sectors will need to prepare for a more challenging economic environment as the global credit crisis kicks in its a pretty gloomy picture but the good news is that business failure rates are still a way off from reaching 2002 levels which saw almost 20 000 companies go bust
1379146 which will be supported by the build up to the olympics
1379147 demonstrating the city has welcomed the united action by the worlds major central banks to make borrowing easier
1379148 there is no doubt that credit conditions for both households and firms have tightened materially
1379149 the turmoil in financial markets is not just a city event
1379150 with internet access now so readily available offshore consumers should take advantage of internet banking and saving as well as offering speedy transfers and an up to date snapshot of your finances the offshore banking and savings market is quickly developing many of the online facilities already available from its onshore counterparts
1379151 the traditional big four banks have constantly trumpeted themselves as britains most trusted names so it was a surprise to see them topped by nationwide
1379152 what was particularly interesting was the reputation of prominent stable mates natwest scored more than triple the number of votes that royal bank of scotland did while hsbc greatly outranked first direct nationwide performed brilliantly not only clearly outstripping its rivals but also being the only building society in the top ten
1379153 the northern rock crisis has clearly focused peoples minds with service reputation and lack of problems being uppermost in peoples minds even ahead of product offerings
1379154 northern rock is now only most trusted by 0 5 per cent of the population showing that trust in a brand can diminish in seconds
1379155 after two years of strong growth there has been a clear turnaround within the financial services sector the credit squeeze has delivered a sharp shock to business volumes over the past three months and it seems that difficulties are likely to persist for some time yet
1379156 this is however a very resilient sector that sees better prospects over the horizon and it is encouraging that profitability job creation and investment plans are all still positive
1379157 f r mich ist die richtige entschluss so werden wir alle besser sein
1379158 2007 is shaping up to be a great year for businesses sales hit such a high in the first half that the prospects for further growth by the end of the year are very real and the effect this has had on business confidence is clear for all to see
1379159 firms may harbour fears about the future of interest rates and the chances of price increases may be slimming but even so their outlook is positive
1379160 after fifteen years the co operative banks ethical policy remains at the leading edge of corporate ethics and has provided a clear challenge to the rest of the sector that there are certain lines that should not be crossed i was hugely impressed by this fifteen years ago and i still am today
1379161 over the last 15 years our ethical policy has acted as a barometer of public opinion
1379162 we are delighted to have appointed experian as our tracing agents
1379163 their expertise in this field will enable us to locate the owners of far more accounts than we could reasonably achieve through our own enquiries
1379164 the testing of the faster payments service has proved more complex and time consuming than originally expected so its introduction will not now be happening this year
1379165 the uk banking industry is disappointed that we wont be able to deliver the new faster payments system as quickly as we had planned but there is no room for error when launching a system which forms part of the uks economic infrastructure
1379166 clearly it is more important to make sure it is done with our total confidence than rushed to meet a self imposed delivery date this is a huge project the investment by uk banks in the central system and in adapting their own systems has been high and is continuing the new service to be delivered in 2008 is ambitious innovative and exciting for users
1379167 for expatriates keeping track of their savings rates when they move abroad during periods of frequent interest rate changes can be confusing and time consuming
1379168 between 1979 and 1997 the uk household savings ratio averaged around 9 5 but since then it has averaged less than 5 5
1379169 with rising life expectancy it is a matter of critical importance that action is taken to encourage people to save for their retirement
1379170 in particular there has been a shift in cultural attitudes towards debt
1379171 being pumped up on easy credit no longer carries a social stigma we are not just talking about those struggling to make ends meet either
1379172 items that just a decade ago would have been regarded as luxuries foreign travel the latest mobile phone and must have gadgets are widely considered a much higher priority than resolving the conundrum of how to survive in retirement this is like watching an accident happening in slow motion
1379173 whilst its encouraging that tv programmes can inspire an army of armchair entrepreneurs into action they only really scratch the surface of what it takes to run a successful business
1379174 people need to check they will benefit fully from any rise in interest rates and switch their savings account if they dont
1379175 we all like to have a holiday or three to look forward to each year for many booking another one is the perfect way to beat post holiday blues with holidays just a mouse click away the temptation to get away from it all has never been greater
1379176 this case has shown that the momentum is now firmly back with british consumers and we intend to do all we can to ensure that as many people as possible get their money back
1379177 the immediate availability of foreign currency would be a valuable addition
1379178 if they dont have an idea now after looking at this for nine months you have to wonder how long into next year is it going to take them to be definite
1379179 you could be looking at half way through the year
1379180 whats also worrying is that the costs of private education can eat into standby savings which some parents may have put aside for a rainy day to use on other financial commitments such as saving for a family holiday or funds for unexpected costs or emergencies
1379181 internet banking is here to stay but there are lessons we can learn from what has happened at northern rock
1379182 it is a question of capacity banking systems are designed to deal with a certain amount of traffic perhaps ten times their normal peak daily activity
1379183 some banks are internet only yet i feel there has to be dual capacity so people can be assured about their savings and investments
1379184 online activities certainly do have a future but banks have to be versatile and learn from this highly unusual event
1379185 those children in areas where parents are the tightest on pocket money will thank them in years to come when they enjoy the benefits of a healthy mature savings fund
1379186 we feel that the banking industry has clearly got to explain the business better and give greater security
1379187 it is encouraging to find that many people are using their savings or their wages to fund their hobbies rather than paying with credit cards or loans saving regularly can be a cost effective way to fund a hobby
1379188 once people have taken the plunge they are unlikely to want to return to their old lifestyle no matter what problems they may encounter
1379189 more caution in terms of borrowing has led to households saving more
1379190 our best guess is that household savings will move up from here
1379191 the real success of the ctf must be the extent to which those accounts are added to whether by parents grand parents or family friends
1379192 with no top ups at all the vouchers will be worth only 1 130 when the child reaches 18 but by topping up by as little as 20 a month it could be worth 8 420
1379193 by contributing the maximum amount 1 200 a year a ctf could be worth 37 560 a great head start for any 18 year old
1379194 with so many accounts in the market savers need to think about which savings account best suits their needs whether thats benefiting from a short term bonus or being able to access their funds without any penalties
1379195 there are a number of attractive accounts for savers to choose from but it is important to understand the terms and conditions if you dont you could be in for a surprise when your rate drops or your bonus expires
1379196 the charges complained of are not charges for breach of contract but part of the price of the services provided by the bank
1379197 is highly unlikely to be the final word in what has been a long campaign to stop banks overcharging their customers
1379198 it takes providers an average of 20 days to pass on an interest rate rise
1379199 the oft recognises that the issue of bank account fees is more complex than it had initially believed
1379200 bank charges have a disproportionate effect on people already on low incomes
1379201 we would encourage savers to also remember the long term and make adequate provisions
1379202 many high street banks overlook the needs of young people outside of the undergraduate group
1379203 before the government spends time and money trying to develop new systems aimed at helping people with their money
1379204 the vast majority of all overseas debit card transactions by natwest and rbs customers are cash withdrawals for an average of 100
1379205 these transactions will now be cheaper under the new fee structure
1379206 a greater alignment of customer needs with what institutions offer is the challenge
1379207 the most wide ranging study into personal banking to date
1379208 will provide the necessary context for assessing the fairness of unauthorised overdraft and returned item charges before we apply the law in this area
1379209 we want greater transparency in what you get and what the charges are
1379210 pinsentry is the next generation of fraud prevention technology and barclays is proud to be the first organisation in the uk to roll it out to its customers
1379211 weve seen double the number of parents committing to save regularly over the long term for their children
1379212 your bank is there to serve you and it must be held accountable
1379213 opposition to paid for banking may not be so severe if banks can prove itll result in a fairer system
1379214 our unique information on people who have moved home over the past 16 years helps us identify them
1379215 it is good to see that the issue is at last being addressed
1379216 to save for their futures in a tax efficient way
1379217 it cant be good for the banks image that so many people found them less than helpful
1379218 it is disappointing that we still define ourselves as a nation of spenders rather than a nation of savers
1379219 people on low incomes often struggle to find affordable credit credit unions give them an affordable safe and dependable alternative
1379220 this result is somewhat worse than we expected and points to a very challenging first half for 2008 given that the full effects of the banks previous increases in interest rates have yet to be felt by many households retailers and manufacturers alike need a rate cut now preferably a full half point
1379221 navigating through the current account jungle can be a real challenge people are reluctant to switch because they are worried about standing orders and direct debits not being paid or feel that the process is too complicated
1379222 for them a default charge of 39 is enough to push them into debt its time banks stopped pulling the wool over peoples eyes and started behaving more responsibly
1379223 our research indicates that there are millions of people who could be making their money work harder for them
1379224 our eight per cent account is a whopping 80 times more valuable than a standard bank account
1379225 it is a real concern that such a high percentage of people havent made a financial plan for the future
1379226 there is never any guarantee that people will earn more as they get older
1379227 its important that couples are open and honest with each other from the start and discuss exactly what the joint account rules are
1379228 this survey shows consumers are reining in their spending in response to higher borrowing costs
1379229 a slower housing market is making its impact felt in particular on sales of consumer durables and more expensive household items
1379230 the wealthy need to watch for the best savings rates as much as anyone else
1379231 though not a foregone conclusion a further interest rate rise now seems more likely than not this autumn and we have built this into our forecast
1379232 recent oil price rises unexpected and sharp increases in food costs higher than expected import prices and businesses rebuilding profit margins after last years squeeze have all added to inflationary pressures
1379233 the economy will still enjoy above trend growth this year with consumer spending remaining robust until the full effect of higher rates is felt later this year
1379234 through building up a buffer savings fund to help deal with these shock events
1379235 switching away to a provider that charges lower overdraft rates and no fees
1379236 phishers are using increasingly sophisticated ways to design phishing emails to lure people into thinking they have come from a trusted provider
1379237 if anyone is ever in doubt as to the authenticity of an email and concerned it may be a phishing scam they should never click on the link embedded in the email
1379238 but their most important issue is the climate change impact of the money they invest and lend and on this they are rather quiet
1379239 the range is broad as the figures are still subject to analysis
1379240 if you do that you are already more than halfway there for a hacker to get into your bank account
1379241 do an awful lot behind the scenes to keep people safe
1379242 there is a lot more going on under the surface its a bit like an iceberg
1379243 so the tip of the iceberg is the bit that you see as a customer and underneath that there are multiple security layers that protect you
1379244 save 2 500 by london olympics with a high interest savings account building societies experience record 6 months for savings accounts
1379245 the big concern is that savings seem to be viewed by many as an unaffordable luxury
1379246 although in todays diverse society there is no such thing as a typical expat people consistently fail to open an offshore savings account when moving abroad with reliable internet access now widely available in most countries expat workers can safely and easily find the best ways to save their wages
1379247 generic financial advice has the potential to help people across the uk to manage their money and to ask the right questions of financial suppliers
1379248 its been quite some time since we have seen the market move at such a pace in just two weeks an investor looking to secure the best fixed rate deal would have missed out on 35 interest on an investment of 10k over one year
1379249 with little to differentiate between fixed rate bonds rate really is the key feature and with so many providers desperately seeking the top spot in the charts there is a fiercely fought contest to win our savings
1379250 as a member of the gcmc executive board ive seen at first hand the valuable role microfinance can play in allowing people to trade their way out of poverty
1379251 the main risks to the inflation outlook in the medium term are the degree of spare capacity in the economy and the extent to which profit margins and pay growth will recover as energy price inflation subsides
1379252 if theres a will in local communities to find suitable sites we have a way to make it happen and ensure those with the greatest need have free access to their cash
1379253 the initiative is designed to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society the elderly disabled those of limited financial means or whose benefits constitute all or the bulk of their income have free access to their cash close to their point of need
1379254 it is hard to encourage people especially children to get into a regular savings habit
1379255 the save and support accounts make saving more interesting as savers feel that they are benefiting their favourite team as well as making an investment in their own financial future
1379256 for banks or institutions that are making huge amounts out of their customers not to protect them is pretty scandalous
1379257 good news travels fast and there is no better endorsement than that of a friend
1379258 our recommend a friend scheme encourages people to spread the word that shopping around for the most competitive current account is a worthwhile process
1379259 with more than half a million new banking relationships being established in the last twelve months and a significant proportion of all businesses now banking online the banks effective support for the small business sector is clear
1379260 hsbcs view is that there will always be free current accounts in the uk
1379261 but that increasingly customers will pay to have value added services bundled with a current account
1379262 depending on which research you look at 15 to 20 per cent of uk current account customers are already paying a monthly fee
1379263 money is one of the few subjects that many people still feel uncomfortable talking about even with their bank
1379264 internet banking has become increasingly popular in recent years not just because its convenient but because it gives people privacy when it comes to managing their money
1379265 despite all the benefits of online banking its important that people dont end up burying their heads in the sand
1379266 last year during the period straight after christmas we witnessed the highest ever amount of people going into personal insolvency
1379267 almost half of those intending to make resolutions readily admit that they are unlikely to keep them beyond january
1379268 some people are still living in the dark ages by keeping money in a piggy bank at home or naively thinking they will put the money aside as and when they can afford to
1379269 pay attention to exactly what card they are using and what they will have to pay for their spending
1379270 paying for the festive season on the credit card can end up costing more than was spent what were offering instead is a way for savers to actually make money on the cost of christmas
1379271 plus unlike other savings accounts were helping customers to be disciplined and keep the money for what its intended rather than dipping into it earlier in the year
1379272 extend free access to cash to those who need it the most
1379273 what were offering instead is a way for savers to actually make money on the cost of christmas by getting a fantastic return of 6 8 per cent on the funds they put away each month
1379274 plus unlike other regular savings accounts were helping them to be disciplined and keep the money for what its intended paying for christmas rather than dipping into it earlier in the year
1379275 detailed and meaningful analysis can be carried out with the information that us banks disclose by area which in turn can be used to combat financial exclusion
1379276 a fast growing community filling essential gaps in the labour market
1379277 the mobile phone is already a central hub of peoples everyday lives
1379278 accessing banking details via a mobile phone is the next natural step and one we think our current account customers will embrace
1379279 the banks have been scamming people for years on these charges and they are totally unlawful
1379280 this account offers a competitive guaranteed rate of return over three years and access to 50 per cent of the funds without notice or penalty at any time the minimum investment is also only 1 making it available to all investors
1379281 this is a foreign invasion everyone with money to save can welcome
1379282 these new banks offer savers more choice higher rates and also put pressure on the existing providers to raise their rates the only losers are the uk banks and building societies
1379283 we werent surprised by these findings as they support our earlier research which indicated that men and women find debt and flashy spending a big turn off
1379284 how do people save in an increasingly cashless society now customers can put a little money aside every time they buy a train ticket a cinema ticket or their weekly groceries
1379285 the perception remains that account switching is complicated and ridden with potential pitfalls
1379286 it seems that when it comes to money mum really is the word
1379287 this is always to be decided on a case by case basis but one of the main deciders will be the extent to which the customer is working with the bank to resolve the problem
1379288 the customers income should only be used to pay off non priority debts when provision has been made for the priorities such as household bills
1379289 it stands to reason that borrowers will always be ultimately responsible for their debts it is their responsibility to ensure they borrow no more than they can afford to pay back and to keep the lender fully informed of any change in circumstances which might delay that repayment
1379290 this new code will deliver greater certainty and transparency for anyone accepting cheques changes to cheque clearing mean increased transparency and that for the first time customers can be sure that six days after paying in a cheque the money is definitely theirs this is great news for all customers but particularly for small businesses and those who have basic bank accounts
1379291 we are disappointed that the opportunity has not been taken by the code reviewer or the banks to end the practices of unsolicited increases in credit limits and unsolicited issuing of credit card cheques
1379292 such practices do not sit easily in our view with the commitment in the code to lend responsibly and may have contributed to a culture of consumers sleepwalking into higher levels of debt
1379293 we are constantly reviewing and updating our product range and the new postal account enables us to extend our presence further afield appealing to those customers who are unable to access our branches
1379294 this is our first step into the direct savings market
1379295 its time for you to do something now every day the child trust fund voucher stays lying in a drawer your child is missing out on the growth this money could be earning for his or her future
1379296 and rest assured if you change your mind in the future about the type of account you want for your child you can move the money to a different one
1379297 five years ago when cahoot first launched the internet and the people who used it were very different
1379298 in a relatively short space of time online banking has become the first choice for many people regardless of gender age socio economic background or location
1379299 whats more online banks like cahoot can offer great rates thanks to lower overheads from not having any branches
1379300 customers can choose which of our accounts suits their preferences rather than according to their income as both now have the same monthly funding amount
1379301 we believe that this is an important development in banking
1379302 our egg money research reveals that consumers do not know at any given time how much money they have available to spend and over half are keen to embrace mobile internet banking as a method of managing their money
1379303 our service on i mode is the start of a revolution in how consumers interact with their finances providing them with immediate convenient and fast access to their money wherever they are
1379304 it will be interesting to see how long this market leading rate is available as demand for an instant access product that comes without some of the usual inhibitive restrictions or penalties is likely to be very high
1379305 although savers will have seen their rates tumble in recent weeks many have probably done nothing about it but this may be the kick they need to move to a better deal
1379306 clearly customers are attracted to the five per cent guaranteed return and even though we have obtained more funds it is impossible to know how long we can keep the product available given the current level of demand
1379307 its amazing to see how much change we keep lying around our homes and how we could be losing out on interest because of this
1379308 this is another reason why using cards instead cash can save you money cards provide a much more convenient efficient and secure way of managing our money as they offer a means of paying for goods to the penny and therefore allow us having greater control over our finances
1379309 we believe that the same principles as those on credit cards should be implemented on all products they should be cost effective and not be cross subsidising
1379310 there is not an investigation at the moment but we are looking at the situation
1379311 we would rather they take on board the guidance from us and the results of court cases and change their ways
1379312 this is a simple straightforward offer which really gives people great value with no fees
1379313 we know that most people in fee paying accounts rarely get the full benefits of everything that is on offer so were just offering the best current account interest rate available and access to abbeys best savings rate as thats what most people want
1379314 the new abbey current account is a case of all that glitters is not gold although six per cent is a great headline rate for a current account it is a little disappointing that it is limited to a balance of 1 000 the size of the interest rate fall after one year where the rate drops from six per cent to 2 5 per cent seems steep also
1379315 theres no denying the connection between the way we relate to our mobile phones and the way we manage our money but the connection isnt always a positive one
1379316 getting to grips with your finances isnt always easy but our new text alert service texts a mini statement to your mobile phone so for people that love their mobile but hate looking after their finances this could be the ideal solution
1379317 the industry has been dragging its heels over providing real clarity for consumers regarding cash machine charges
1379318 consequently nationwide is taking action by implementing a straightforward solution to counter consumer confusion
1379319 green and red signs which are visible at a glance will be instantly recognisable and their introduction is supported by an overwhelming majority of people
1379320 starting university should be one of the most exciting times of your life but it can be stressful
1379321 and whilst its clear from the results of this years survey that money is high on the list of concerns for their years intake students should be aware of the wide range of support which is available to them both financial and non financial from banks the nus and universities
1379322 the impact of a computer virus can be extensive and in some cases result in a compromise of pc security
1379323 the free security scan we are offering will identify any potentially suspicious spyware customers may have on their computer and give them the opportunity to purchase and update their security software conveniently and at a reduced price
1379324 offset plus has been designed with first time buyers in mind
1379325 it allows parents who cannot afford to give a sizeable amount of money to their children an option where they can provide financial support to their children
1379326 offset plus does not allow individuals to borrow more than they can afford but helps to make life easier once they have taken that big step onto the housing ladder
1379327 most of us prefer to think that it will never happen to me but after losing a job suddenly suffering a bad fall or becoming ill long term most of us would struggle to cover the cost of our regular monthly commitments
1379328 it is imperative that people plan for such eventualities and this guide sets out the options available to protect yourself and your loved ones should disaster strike
1379329 there is a real danger that banking customers are encouraged to take out the latest packaged account on offer whether or not it is right for them and whether or not the benefits offered as part of the account will be of any use to them
1379330 we urge packaged account customers to question whether the 130 most of them pay out each year is really worth it
1379331 one of the best paying credit interest accounts on the market
1379332 customers really have to consider whether they will make full use of the text alerts if they are unable to check their balance through cash machines internet branch or telephone banking this may work out cost effective as it will give them the ability to move funds before being charged which will still cost 20 an item even after the cost reduction
1379333 we regularly ask our members for feedback on the products and services we provide
1379334 the banks are cherry picking the most profitable customers only paying lip service to tackling financial exclusion
1379335 their lack of action leaves the most vulnerable marginalised from mainstream financial services paying more for everyday goods and with no option but loan sharks for credit
1379336 day by day consumers right to access cash for free is being eroded by the rapid growth in charging machines
1379337 we want to see clear signs on all cash machines telling you at a glance whether a machine is free or not and we welcome the cabs backing
1379338 charges for using cash machines are excessive unfair and on the increase
1379339 the balance of news has turned around significantly over the past month and we now expect rates to remain on hold at 4 5 per cent for the remainder of the year
1379340 would mean the longest period of interest rate stability since the mpc was formed in 1997
1379341 we expect charges to be cost reflective and not to cross subsidise other services that applies to all bank charges
1379342 reflect the cost of collection for accounts that have defaulted
1379343 these are not hidden charges they are published on websites and in brochures
1379344 hectic lifestyles mean that we often find it difficult to keep on top of our finances and providers can help by making saving more accessible
1379345 we have teamed up with tesco personal finance to do just this the partnership will make it even more straightforward and easy for people to find out about our savings and investments while carrying out their weekly shop
1379346 this is the highest figure weve yet recorded over 17 months of tracking and indicates the moneymood of the nation is firmly in save mode
1379347 moneymood found that people who were in the mood to save in the run up to christmas spent around 40 per cent more over the festive season than they anticipated
1379348 people in the mood to spend only spent around seven per cent more than anticipated at christmas
1379349 the improvement and simplification of our savings range and the ten per cent regular saver demonstrates barclays determination to give its existing customers value for money products
1379350 we will be launching new products across current accounts savings and mortgages during the course of 2006 to attract more customers to barclays and retain those already with us
1379351 its easy to forget the obvious the time to save money is when you have some a cash cushion is one of the comfiest things to own and its not every day that you get to almost double your interest
1379352 apathy costs consumers dear and this is what the big banks rely on to keep their profits fuelled
1379353 the old adage that the high street equates to convenience and good value is increasingly becoming a myth as more consumers become savvy in their attitudes to finance and recognise the importance of shopping around and using the internet for securing the best deals
1379354 banks and building societies do a good job with the limited advice they offer
1379355 however these organisations with one or two exceptions only recommend their own products
1379356 customers relying on them will therefore not be researching all the available products and may be missing out on the best deals
1379357 the north of scotland leads the way when it comes to savings balances compared to average earnings while west lothian has the lowest average savings balance as a percentage of earnings
1379358 its not that we were trying to run a marathon just that when you play for that amount of time sometimes you run into certain musical episodes that are amazing its like you have to somehow be in contact with the whole piece from the beginning til the end and try to make it stand together without losing the spirit
1379359 this is a straightforward offer which gives great value offers flexibility and is available to anyone
1379360 while other banks default to online accounts current accounts and in some cases poor paying savings accounts abbey offers customers the only default account with the same type of savings terms as the fixed rate monthly saver account
1379361 we know people want a good rate of interest and we urge everyone to shop around to get the best rate
1379362 with students facing tuition fees to the tune of 3 000 a year for the first time in 2006 and student loan income lagging behind typical outgoings by well over 5 500 last year its the money saving features of their bank account that will make a real difference
1379363 about 590 000 people come to live and work in the uk every year and our customer research shows that migrants regard having a bank account as one of the most important aspects of settling in
1379364 but many are not aware of the requirements for proving identity and address plus the need for banks to establish credit and employment histories
1379365 as a result applying for a bank account can become time consuming and frustrating hardly a warm welcome
1379366 on its own this product is very competitive combined with one of our current accounts its a fantastic deal that can make customers hundreds of pounds better off every year
1379367 our graduate royalties account has really useable benefits and graduates can start reaping the discounts on offer as soon as their account is open
1379368 we realise that graduates may feel under financial pressure after leaving university
1379369 so to assist in easing that pressure we have a great team of advisers on hand in our branches to talk to graduates about any concerns that they may have
1379370 when it comes to the banks beating a path to your door students should know why they are so valued
1379371 the banks are keen to secure students business because the start of university is one of the key life stages at which people might open a new current account and they are a viewed as a lucrative long term customer
1379372 students should make the most of being courted by the banks but recognise that though little profit may be made out of them while they are studying payback will commence after they graduate
1379373 a amp ls fee free premier direct account has consistently offered a market leading credit interest rate and highly competitive overdraft rates since its launch
1379374 taking this into consideration alongside the first class customer service offered by a amp l premier direct emerged as the clear and deserved winner of best current account 2006
1379375 although interest rates on these accounts are not as high as some online savings accounts most have instant access and pay rates which compete with other branch based savings products especially when the donation to your favourite club is taken into account
1379376 for those clubs without a russian billionaire to keep the bank manager sweet it can be a much needed boost to club funds when loyal supporters put their money where their heart is in an effort to see their team through the forthcoming season
1379377 it is hugely encouraging that more people than ever are actively switching their isas but there is still a significant number of savers who are oblivious to the principle of switching
1379378 putting your money into an isa is not the equivalent of locking it up and throwing away the key isa savers need to know they could get themselves a better deal by opting for a provider that offers consistently competitive rates
1379379 this move by halifax puts further pressure on the big high street banks the majority of which are still taking their customers for granted and offering unattractive current account terms
1379380 on a purely credit interest rate basis the halifax account is the clear market leader for current account holders with modest balances
1379381 researching the market to check how competitive your bank is should be routine for all banking customers especially given how simple and straightforward the switching process is today
1379382 the credit card and current account markets have become fiercely competitive in recent years
1379383 delivering excellent customer service is imperative in attracting and retaining customers who are the lifeblood of the society
1379384 over the past twelve months we have seen a marked increase in the number of people switching to the nationwide flexaccount and we recently finished top in a credit card customer satisfaction survey conducted by uswitch com
1379385 our employees are committed to putting members interests first and people realise that at nationwide you really do receive the type of service hoped for from your financial service provider
1379386 with the end of the student grant the introduction of tuition fees and ever increasing living expenses being a student has never been more expensive
1379387 these increased interest free overdrafts could mean a significant saving over a three year course of study far better value than a record token or other gimmicks
1379388 the fast pace of modern life means that everyone needs a current account that will work hard for them
1379389 atm networks across the country are being increasingly targeted by fraudsters
1379390 3 million is a worthwhile investment to protect our customers hard earned cash
1379391 customers used our atms over 300 million times last year and we want every one of them to feel secure in their use
1379392 the expansion in free to use atms in post office branches complements the free cash access service we offer at the counter on behalf of 19 banks and building societies
1379393 more than one million free cash withdrawals are made every day at the post office making us the largest free to use cash network in the uk
1379394 when britannia first announced the acquisition last year we pledged that no members would be worse off
1379395 the issue that many within the muslim community have is that they were struggling to raise capital to purchase a house because the sorts of products that were on offer from the major high street lenders involve the charging of interest
1379396 if you look at what the chancellor of the exchequer said earlier this week in terms of encouraging islamic finance yes more high street banks may seek to offer these products
1379397 hsbc and lloyds for example have products within their portfolio which are on offer to both muslims and non muslims and which are not sharia compliant
1379398 a large number of people are likely to spend more of their leisure time at home through june and early july to watch the world cup with some of this being at the expense of time that they would otherwise be looking round the shops
1379399 in addition the vast majority of people buying flat screen tvs and items such as england t shirts and flags for the world cup have probably now made their purchases
1379400 on the positive side a good run by england would be liable to provide an extended significant boost to alcohol sales
1379401 and the world cup in general is likely to boost sales of home delivery pizzas curries and chinese meals as well as takeaway meals and snacks
1379402 improving financial education in schools needs to be a major objective of the governments ten year strategy for improving financial capability
1379403 financial education is something that everybody has a right to
1379404 over a million basic bank accounts for people who had previously had no bank account at all
1379405 financial capability is about understanding the implications of aprs and compound interest and being able to make decisions based on that understanding
1379406 uncertainty surrounds the extent to which current credit conditions will affect both business and consumer confidence and how far the property markets will suffer borrowing conditions are already tighter for some households and businesses
1379407 our survey results explode the myth that cash transactions are about loose change it is crucial to realise the importance of the humble coin and note when such a high proportion of cash transactions in the uk involves sums of more than 80
1379408 businesses need to ensure they have the right facilities set up for cash handling so they are paying minimum fees and earning maximum interest on the cash they bank
1379409 research we carried out earlier this year showed that both saving and investment levels in the uk are set to increase
1379410 it showed that people are planning to increase the amount they save to nearly double the amount they did a year ago and investment confidence is also increasing
1379411 this plan is ideal as it balances the need for a safe haven for short term savings whilst giving the opportunity to invest over the longer term for potentially higher returns than from a typical deposit account
1379412 the research shows that uk savers have all the right instincts when it comes to finding a good home for their money
1379413 however the theory isnt necessarily working out in practice as people are not regularly checking interest rates meaning that they could be missing out on the most competitive rates
1379414 switching accounts is an increasingly easy process and we would urge all savers to check their savings rate to make sure they are making the best of their money
1379415 a staggering 16 million britons run out of cash each month and often resort to expensive overdrafts to make it through to payday consumers can easily slip into the red each month if they dont have a clear figure of what they can afford to spend
1379416 the financial pressures of modern life are creating a potential double whammy for the middle generation who are increasingly required to come to the rescue of both parents and children
1379417 with concern over high house prices personal debt inadequate pensions and spiralling council taxes and education costs it would appear that these worries are unlikely to be resolved in the short term
1379418 while its alarming that 20 per cent of people in work fear that they may not be able to survive on their savings for more than a month our research indicates that the situation could in fact be far worse with not even half 43 per cent of the working population holding more than 1 000 worth of available cash savings
1379419 we believe that our new childrens regular saver account is a fantastic addition to our childrens savings product range nowadays it is important to give children a head start when it comes to financial matters and our new account is aimed at offering an easy and hassle free way of building up a fund for a childs future
1379420 this is a limited issue and we are determined to make it available as long as possible
1379421 however a product paying such an attractive return will prove extremely popular in any portfolio with a maturity date of march 1st 2007 investors also have sufficient time to take advantage of the tax year end
1379422 the number of people who have made the connection between balancing a healthy diet with regular exercise is still low let alone taking this to the next stage and realising that there should be a balance between health and financial matters
1379423 at the moment there is a small proportion of companies doing this but there is a danger that others will follow suit in an effort to create a level playing field
1379424 we understand that providers may not be able to implement reductions to existing mortgages straightaway they need time to advise customers of changes to direct debits and actually put the changes in place
1379425 nine out of ten firms have internet access and nearly 80 per cent of them cite obtaining business information for their business as the most important reason why
1379426 were giving businesses the convenience of a vast 24 hour information database at their fingertips as well as access to their banking
1379427 wed like to give customers the service they require so we will be suspending our marketing activities for 15 days two months maximum
1379428 after that well go for a big marketing campaign when all the operations are in place
1379429 the ns amp i summer savings survey reveals that although parents have good intentions a significant proportion are failing to talk to their children about money with the financial pressures on the younger generation greater than ever it is vital that we help educate children on money matters
1379430 this result challenges the bleak view of britain as a nation obsessed with spending and debt and demonstrates there is a distinct group of british savers who are not only in the black but committed to saving every little penny
1379431 this may be influenced by the increased use of the internet which not only makes saving easier but also offers many ways to cut spending people are increasingly embracing this and are proud of their savings
1379432 protecting vulnerable communities from the impact of post office closures is no simple task people are as important as places in these decisions its vital that plans for the next 2 500 closures protect the people who would be hardest hit
1379433 recognise this and make it easier for them to give their views
1379434 at a national level post office ltd has worked with sub postmasters preferences to decide which post offices should be closed however in practice a consistent pattern is not easy to discern some neighbourhoods of acute social need do not seem to have benefited from protection and the closure rate is very uneven between similar areas as well as across different regions of the country
1379435 it seems that many of us believe that charity begins at home even after we achieve our financial goals
1379436 but the road to complete financial independence is not about setting a single set of objectives its about constantly setting and reviewing new goals for ourselves if you budget correctly you will not only be able to see the world but see the world saved too
1379437 we believe that it is important that as many people as possible start saving early for their future and as tax efficiently as possible
1379438 our research shows that 43 per cent of people who have taken financial advice in the past think it was bad advice
1379439 although we must stress that the market has cleaned up its act after the pensions miss selling debacle of the 90s it does go some way to explaining why so many people in the uk are putting off their financial future
1379440 with so many financial victims out there theres little surprise that people are wary of making financial decisions
1379441 the typical response to valentines day is both a practical and romantic one if its going to happen anyway then we want to give it our best shot whether that means dinner or a gift
1379442 we have specifically designed this product to offer customers a fantastic rate and a choice of term and access so more customers can open an account that suits their needs
1379443 the minimum opening balance is only 100 providing a high rate of return to the smaller investor
1379444 the typical response to valentines day is both a practical and romantic one if its going to happen anyway then we want to give it our best shot whether that means dinner or a gift
1379445 money is a very difficult subject to talk about but ignoring financial problems can make them worse
1379446 although we know that brits are savvy enough to ensure they are contributing to their savings on a regular basis their desire to live a life of luxury is damaging their nest egg
1379447 our report also shows that a lack of planning is eating away at piggybanks across the country another slippery slope that could leave them short in the future
1379448 the only way to control debt and increase saving power is to adopt careful budgeting
1379449 fixed rate savings bonds offer the security of an attractive return but as with any savings product its important to shop around to make sure that you are receiving a competitive return
1379450 choosing the spend now pay later way that many of us do can be costly
1379451 for example if a customer spent 900 on their credit card last christmas and then pays the minimum monthly payment which is typically five per cent at 16 per cent apr they will take 64 months to pay off their debt and will end up paying out 288 74 in interest this is a false economy
1379452 while innovative products and competitive rates are important its service quality that makes or breaks the customer relationship
1379453 as the retail banks strive to become more cost effective service related initiatives are often the first to go this could be a short sighted approach
1379454 our range of fixed rate bonds continue to be exceptionally well received
1379455 although the scale of increase is notable the absolute numbers are still extremely small and set to remain so
1379456 people are already having to go out of their way to dodge the fee charging cashpoints in shops and bars
1379457 what this research shows is that its likely that many people also waste time and effort trying to find a machine run by their own bank to ensure they wont be charged
1379458 the festive season can be a drain on finances but it is at least encouraging to see that weve managed to leave some of our savings intact
1379459 some banks mentioned that if there was going to be a cut in credit card charges they were going to start charging on current accounts so there wouldnt be free banking anymore
1379460 hopefully there will be enough competition in the market to make sure these charges dont actually take off
1379461 we are now expecting an increase in interest rates to 4 75 per cent by the end of the year as opposed to the 4 5 per cent we had been expecting earlier
1379462 it is likely that the impact of an interest rate rise will be passed by lenders to their customers so that would make payments rise
1379463 unchanged interest rates were a certainty and david walton is likely to have been the only dissenter as he again voted for an immediate 25 basis point hike
1379464 nevertheless the outlook for monetary policy even in the near term is far from certain and the minutes of the meeting should make very interesting reading
1379465 there is a strong case for interest rates to remain unchanged given significant uncertainties about the longer term growth outlook
1379466 customer service is something that doesnt appear to get the focus it once did perhaps because providers are concentrating on the provision of internet based accounts
1379467 however the results of the latest moneyfacts co uk survey only goes to emphasise that consumers expect to receive a decent level of customer service when visiting a branch of their bank or building society or telephoning a call centre
1379468 this shows that consumers do not think their bank building society or lender treats them as a valued client
1379469 the british tax burden continues to rise and so tax freedom day advances later and later into the calendar
1379470 as much as anything else the day getting later this year is probably down to fiscal drag where people are being brought into higher rates of tax because the allowances arent being indexed by the rate of wage increased but by inflation
1379471 for most people banking does not provide any form of rewarding or valued experience it is simply a necessity
1379472 in contrast the community sites we looked at appeared to offer a much deeper appreciation of the individual far beyond the actual transaction
1379473 a clear indication that the sector is more robust than ever
1379474 we will do our best not merely to mitigate the effects of farepaks collapse but ensure this does not happen in future
1379475 too often you see people just throw away in the bin the kind of information fraudsters can use
1379476 the banks have a duty to protect their customers and to keep information safe they are good at it but isolated incidents can crop up people have to take responsibility for their own security too
1379477 providing you have not acted fraudulently or without reasonable care
1379478 testament that the bank charges campaign has struck a real chord with the public
1379479 it is pensioners disabled people and those living on low incomes who rely the most on their local post office for basic services
1379480 a constructive and imaginative initiative which should help to address the markets short term borrowing needs
1379481 it is also importantly an international solution to an international issue
1379482 a recognition that all major economies are feeling the effects of the credit crunch and that together they can help to address them
1379483 this news just goes to illustrate again how serious the illiquidity issue in money markets has become
1379484 for monetary policy to work it is important that changes in bank rate are passed on to money market rates and this just wasnt happening
1379485 if it works and its too early to tell at the moment this action reduces some of the downside risks to growth in 2008
1379486 but it doesnt change my view that the uk economy will slow appreciably or that interest rates will be cut again early next year
1379487 we want to offer muslim customers banking services that meet the needs of their faith while providing them with all the benefits that they have come to expect from a high street bank
1379488 they will be able to manage their money in accordance with islamic law but still have access to around 2 000 branches across the uk and the ability to bank online over the phone or using a cashpoint
1379489 these results give encouraging signs that we may be slowly becoming a nation of savers
1379490 at lloyds tsb we use the highest levels of industry standard security so customers can access their accounts online with the utmost confidence
1379491 but while we are doing everything we can to make our security watertight we also urge all of our customers to think carefully about the measures they have taken to protect their pc this means regularly updating their anti virus software and ensuring they have a robust firewall
1379492 the privilege account has been very popular since we first launched it in 2001 but in response to customer demand we have now added a range of ethical benefits
1379493 obviously there are a number of women who are not in a position to work and have no personal income to use for savings
1379494 but one other possible explanation is that a greater proportion of women than men suggested that i love to spend it as soon as i get it was an apt way of describing their approach to personal finances
1379495 clearly given the growing necessity for the nation as a whole to be increasing its overall level of savings these results are extremely worrying particularly in light of the pensions time bomb
1379496 the research shows that there are many expatriates who have not considered whether they would benefit from holding their savings in an offshore account
1379497 given the competitive rates available from offshore banks such as alliance amp leicester international they could increase their interest earnings significantly
1379498 the results suggest that the lack of attention from all the parties on how to recreate a saving culture in the uk may have pushed the issue out of peoples minds
1379499 we think there should be a greater focus on encouraging people to save from all political parties
1379500 the convenience of online banking is an obvious draw for millions of customers who want to be able to manage their money when and where they choose this service will make things even easier for customers by allowing them to search through records dating back almost three years
1379501 the midlands business centre team have a wealth of specialist commercial finance expertise to help businesses in the region find the most appropriate solution for their financial requirements
1379502 industry research shows the most popular reason for saving is for a rainy day which is just as well as when you dig a little deeper you find that many savers incur unforeseen expenditure over a typical year mainly to pay for repairs around the home or to their car
1379503 it makes good financial sense to have some money put aside that you can call on for when the unexpected happens its great news that there is now an account specifically designed to provide a home for those emergency funds
1379504 we are in the final stages of consulting with our banks to determine the flavour of these specifications we will see as a uk standard
1379505 by the start of may we should have agreement on the authentication standard
1379506 finance directors have given us a huge vote of confidence and the credibility that comes with this will further enhance our growing reputation in the corporate marketplace
1379507 this really is a unique opportunity for people who have offshore accounts that they have not been telling us about to come forward save money and put matters straight
1379508 those who decide for whatever reason not to take advantage of the disclosure arrangements will be investigated to make sure that everyone pays their fair share
1379509 the days when hiding assets offshore were seen as a safe bet for evading the uks taxes have gone this has to be good news for the great majority of taxpayers who pay what the law says they should
1379510 it now seems clears that consumers are taking this to heart in their spending intentions
1379511 recent events such as the floods and the turmoil in the financial markets may also be having something of an impact on their sentiment
1379512 our figures are proof that ifas have an important role to play in the consumer financial advice arena
1379513 its worth reviewing your current account to ensure that youre getting the best deal
1379514 this is intended to ensure that the account becomes the customers primary current account
1379515 when you could get stung for more than 60 just for going beyond your overdraft limit people need to pay careful attention to their spending and the arrangement they currently have with their bank
1379516 few dont charge at all so you should talk to your bank about a more realistic limit if youre incurring fees regularly you can also query charges when they are imposed
1379517 some people might think that their bank charges are on the verge of being reduced or scrapped following the recent oft investigation and the glut of claims but the court case continues and the charges remain
1379518 from that way people can have some great book recommendations if they like the teaser youve given leave a comment with your answers if you dont have a blog
1379519 time and again people tell us that sorting out their finances is a top priority but many overlook the difference that a competitive current account can make to their finances switching your current account can seem like a daunting prospect but in reality it couldnt be simpler
1379520 resolutions are not just for christmas they can be made at any time of the year and sometimes committing to making changes mid year feels easier having time off work in the summer or just having a lighter workload can help people get their lives in perspective and think about the changes they want to make before christmas comes around
1379521 money is obviously a topic at the forefront of most peoples minds
1379522 she drinks milk from her two mouths and opens and shuts all the four eyes at one time
1379523 i am writing to the state government to provide money to build the temple and help the parents look after their daughter
1379524 she is leading a normal life with no breathing difficulties
1379525 we usually get damage claims about stones kicked up from the roadway or overspray from painting i have never heard of anyone being compensated for the loss of gasoline
1379526 but i couldnt get over to the ramp before i got past it
1379527 salah satu momen yang paling menakutkan adalah ketika cewek udah mulai kambuh sentimentilitasnya kenapa karena pas waktu itu hm aku pikir mungkin sekarang memang waktu yang tepat untuk meneror orang rrrrgh awaaaaas ada booom
1379528 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1379529 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1379530 there is a risk arising from what has happened here of serious damage to the reputation of the whole finance and retail industry
1379531 giving kids some cash for christmas is a good way to put a smile on their face and possibly help them to get the savings habit
1379532 i dont want to spoil the fun but if your child has some cash lying around on top of their christmas presents this year it might be worth suggesting they start saving it might not be what every kid wants but its certainly a good way to introduce the idea of thinking about money
1379533 over the last few weeks moneyfacts co uk has seen the launch of several festively titled regular savings accounts which started now could provide the perfect savings plan for christmas 2009
1379534 lulled in by headline grabbing rates without first knowing the full terms of the account these high rates dont come easily to get the top rates you will have to be prepared to jump through hoops perhaps being required to open other accounts with the provider take out an investment plan or buy a protection product
1379535 first direct was the uks first telephone bank and is now the most successful online bank
1379536 were delighted that consumers are happy with the service we provide and well continue to strive to offer them the best in electronic and telephone banking
1379537 there are some attractive returns for savers but it is important that they read the small print so that they understand all of the terms and conditions offered by savings accounts
1379538 many top accounts rely on bonuses and if savers are unaware of this they can be in for a shock when these expire and their rates fall
1379539 the products gives savers the best of both worlds with guaranteed increases in rate combined with excellent access to their funds
1379540 there are a whole variety of ways of engaging young people of that age with the issues there are many different methods ranging from drama to a whole load of other things
1379541 the reason this campaign has struck such a chord with people is that they feel these charges are disproportionate and unfair considering the cost to the bank
1379542 slapped an asbo thats an anti social banking order on current account providers for the way they are treating their customers
1379543 the general rule is to be very cautious about how much information you give away and who can see it
1379544 the government should take stronger action against schools to make uniform policies more realistic and affordable and should monitor schools to make sure they stick to the guidelines
1379545 we are deeply concerned about the dramatic increase in the number of surcharging atms and the very real threat that they will soon outnumber the free to use machines
1379546 young inexperienced and vulnerable people are being targeted by adverts and mail shots which lead them to believe they will be able to walk away from their responsibilities
1379547 times have changed and while concerns about expenditure are high attitudes towards what we can or cant go without in our daily lives are very different to ten years ago busy working lives may be responsible for creating a need for convenience but also for reward as we feel we deserve the little things that make our lives easier and cant go without them even if we know we could do with the extra cash sometimes
1379548 this time of year puts our pockets under the most pressure but it is still possible to save without being a scrooge
1379549 immediate introduction of expertise appropriate to the struggling banks current position
1379550 it is time for all stakeholders to work together to ensure prompt and full repayment of the bank of england facility and to set northern rock back on course for a successful and independent future
1379551 we believe that this proposal satisfies the requirement of all stakeholders including the tripartite authorities principles for assessing northern rock proposals whilst confirming the broad and constructive support from shareholders
1379552 there is no option but to nationalise it because of the broader instability it is causing to the financial system
1379553 the projection figures are quite staggering and its unrealistic to expect peoples income levels will increase in line with this rising level of expenditure this means parents will need to be switched on about their family finances more than ever even though they have always known that raising a child is costly with uk debt figures rising we would recommend starting financial planning as early as possible to help meet the various costs associated with raising a child
1379554 no one likes to pay the taxman more than they need yet 83 per cent of savings accounts are still not held tax efficiently
1379555 with a large percentage of our customer base in far off places we knew there would be a need for internet banking
1379556 now our customers will have the freedom to control all aspects of their accounts with the assurance that it is safe and secure all from the comfort of their own home wherever they live
1379557 for many people the internet is the channel of choice for shopping around for financial products however it can expose consumers to high risk as they are able to make instant purchases without advice this is why it is so important that firms websites are fair clear and not misleading
1379558 although many firms website based promotions are meeting our requirements we expect the senior management of all regulated firms to ensure their customers are treated fairly and we will be looking at promotional websites again early next year to make sure that firms have taken our findings on board and are taking website design seriously
1379559 there are a number of actions we can take against firms and individuals including fines public censures or stopping firms and or individuals from doing business in addition to these penalties we can also instruct a firm to conduct a detailed and lengthy review of their clients files this will establish whether any customers are owed redress and could cost firms many thousands of pounds
1379560 the bank of england is behaving like the british governor in carry on up the khyber who when asked for his response to a crisis replies were british we wont do anything
1379561 uk rates are very high by international standards and the boe needs to wake up and start cutting in my view uk rates need to come down by 1 per cent as soon as possible this would enable the excesses that have built up in the economy to be gradually worked off rather than undergo a painful and sudden readjustment
1379562 lowering rates before the holiday season would make little difference to shoppers as is the case every year they spend what they have and more
1379563 to assure banks of liquidity over the year end the bank will be offering a substantial proportion of the reserves we supply in the form of a five week facility that will extend to the end of the maintenance period in the second week of january
1379564 we stand ready to take further measures in order to keep the overnight rate in line with the bank rate
1379565 if you were shopping on the high street you wouldnt leave your wallet open and we advise that you dont do the same online
1379566 with the average christmas spend level at 620 for individuals without children consumers are using their credit cards on a more regular basis to help budget for it not only are consumers being left with a large financial hangover in the new year but they are putting themselves at greater risk of becoming victims of id fraud
1379567 unless consumers start to take some preventative steps the consequences could be very damaging
1379568 it is impossible to be 100 percent safe from identity theft fraudsters are always looking for new ways to commit id fraud so it is essential that consumers are aware of how to protect themselves
1379569 the declines in the national figure are notable for two reasons
1379570 first the 3rd quarter decline at 1 7 was the largest quarterly decline in the indexs 21 year history
1379571 and second the year over year decline posted its second consecutive record low at 4 5
1379572 consistent with prior 2007 reports there is no real positive news in todays data
1379573 people should get smart and take steps to avoid falling foul of their agreed overdraft by planning better where possible
1379574 bank charges may be a hot topic in the media but many peoples idea of how much they are being charged for their overdrafts is horribly wide of the mark
1379575 average unauthorised overdraft interest rates are around 25 per cent and fees for getting overdrawn without permission can be as much as 30
1379576 its critical that people check with their bank to ensure they are borrowing money at a competitive rate
1379577 should put their books in the public domain and explain how they come up with those calculations
1379578 we find it very difficult to believe that the charges being levied by the banks are proportionate to the costs
1379579 i believe it was right to intervene that it was right to put in place guarantees arrangements to savers and it is right to see it through
1379580 far worse would have been to have done nothing to have allowed that bank to have gone under
1379581 i believe this would have had very serious consequences for the banking system and for the british economy
1379582 i welcome northern rocks decision to work with virgin to turn its proposal into a hard agreement with northern rock and the authorities
1379583 the pressure on alistair darling to come before parliament and explain himself builds by the day
1379584 we now discover evidence of personal data being lost two years ago and a promise at the time from hmrc to fix the problem this all points to a wider systemic failure in the department that gordon brown ran for ten years
1379585 last week a number of abbott employee paper records went missing in transit from its third party payroll provider logica cmg to abbotts payroll office in queenborough despite a secure recorded delivery system
1379586 abbott and logica cmg are conducting a full and thorough investigation to establish the whereabouts of the missing records and we have informed the police as a precautionary measure
1379587 at this point in time there is no reason to suspect that the records have been stolen or that any employee information has been compromised
1379588 current accounts have become a melting pot for all of our money matters but they do not give us an accurate picture of where we stand financially at any one time
1379589 it appears there has been a shift in consumers paying for goods on credit to paying from their current accounts with money they already have maybe this is the start of more sensible lending
1379590 the existence of yads was discovered when we first started to analyse the data we were delighted to see that the young are leading the way when it comes to savings which we feel is a highly optimistic sign for the future saving is a habit which should be started young and increased in line with earnings
1379591 any parent knows raising a child isnt cheap but its amazing that so many expect these costs to continue until a child has their feet firmly set on a career path
1379592 the fact that nearly two thirds will use their savings to fund the cost of ambition shows how determined british parents are to do the best for their kids
1379593 this urban spenders research shows us that whilst people might think that the more money you have the less likely you are to go into the red but this isnt so and certainly proves the old saying the more you have the more you spend
1379594 people with money seem confident to utilise their overdraft and credit cards and it demonstrates these urbanites modern approach to money management
1379595 short of combining some disparate activities like sleeping at work or eating your children the way to manufacture time is to shorten unnecessary time wasting activities

1379597 poor countries lose about 2 billion a day because of unjust trade rules thats 14 times the amount they receive in aid
1379598 if you think that this is unfair and would like to help to change it then just visit your local co operative bank and join thousands of others in the vote for trade justice today
1379599 there are many distractions to stop us from saving more but we need to look at whether our reasons for failing to save are real constraints or stumbling blocks that can easily be overcome
1379600 by either cutting back on a luxury a month or simply switching savings account to one that better suits your needs many savers will see these barriers disappear and their savings grow with new services such as saving by standing order by phone or online it has never been easier to save
1379601 for those people who wish to invest in the stock market but are worried about the risks guaranteed equity bonds are the investment solution

1379607 a number of economic and social factors such as rising house prices and people having children later in life all of which take their toll on the age of financial independence
1379608 the recent financial market volatility coupled with julys encouraging inflation figures has prompted economists to reign in their interest rate expectations and it seems like consumers have followed suit

1379610 over indebtedness grabs the headlines but these figures show that many people are sensibly looking after their future
1379611 people are generally positive about their quality of life in 2007
1379612 there are so few calls going through now they can be comfortably handled in the uk
1379613 although most of us feel like we are hibernating over the winter months its still an expensive time of the year
1379614 utility bills can soar as we crank up the heating and we also use retail treats to ward off the winter blues
1379615 it has even eclipsed mortgage endowment complaints we usually get 200 to 250 of them a day so it has well surpassed that
1379616 the law is plain any charges banks levy on their customers must be proportional to the actual costs they incur
1379617 the simple question is does it really cost 35 to send an automated letter when someones gone 1p over the limit
1379618 the first major provider to introduce charges for all customers is going to take a lot of flak but it is likely that the majority of the main providers will then follow the lead
1379619 every household in the uk contributed an average of more than 400 to the profits of the big five banks
1379620 nationwides customers were entitled to rely upon it to take reasonable steps to make sure their personal information was secure

1379624 there have been lots of positive comments about an early settlement being good for stability and the future of the market with which we agree
1379625 fraudsters often attempt to borrow money in their victims names so it makes sense to take steps to protect yourself as a member of creditexpert you can look at your credit report as often as you want over time which is crucially important because identity thieves may wait years to take over an identity
1379626 the banking code is the charter that sets out how customers are treated by their banks and building societies it is there to ensure that everyone both customers and financial providers know what they have to do and where their responsibilities lie
1379627 these revisions to the code reflect the need to keep up with a changing world it will continue to underpin the treatment and protection customers value and have every right to expect
1379628 on the positive side they do offer good value for depositors who know they will not need to access their money
1379629 other savers needing to make withdrawals but aiming to minimise their interest penalties would do well to close such accounts on the day that least interest will be lost rather than making partial withdrawals in effect this would treat these accounts as flexible term accounts with a closure option each month
1379630 weighing up all these arguments most committee members concluded that bank rates should be left unchanged this month however some members thought that an immediate cut was warranted
1379631 the average standard variable rate if you look at all the lenders is 7 75 per cent so its over two per cent above the base rate
1379632 the lenders are completely detached the bank of england might lower rates tomorrow but the lenders would say thats fine but we still need to make a profit there is a dislocation between the bank of england and what lenders lend at its completely different now that was one of the conventions that was broken after this credit crunch
1379633 i profoundly regret and apologise for the inconvenience and worries that have been caused to millions of families who receive child benefit
1379634 millions of people today will be worrying about the safety of their bank accounts and the security of their family details
1379635 but they will not just be worried they will be angry that the government has failed in its first duty to protect the public
1379636 there was no impact on security in any way accessibility for people to their own accounts was the problem not security
1379637 it would be wrong if every withdrawal was to hit consumers in the pocket
1379638 recent moneyfacts co uk polls show that 88 per cent of consumers are planning to switch credit card providers this year 84 per cent plan to take out a personal loan and 41 per cent plan to move house

1379642 the changes made to the rpi basket over the past five years reflect the key changes and trends that have affected both society and the lifestyles of the nation
1379643 the basket of goods also reflects trends in banking services from the introduction of overdraft rates in 2001 right through to the removal of annual credit card fees from the basket in 2002
1379644 i believe that this particular type of malware represents a huge threat to the online financial industry
1379645 this provides possibly the first real evidence that the rate hikes to date are starting to dampen consumer confidence and curb peoples appetite for consumer credit at least
1379646 current account customers are increasingly using the phone and internet for day to day transactions and prefer to visit branches for more complex issues
1379647 the launch of premier plus reflects this changing trend in banking
1379648 our research shows that up to three million people in the uk will become an expatriate at some point in their lives they have a lot to sort out when they move abroad including their banking
1379649 our new look mirrors the new abbey brand already familiar to people in the uk to help them feel that they are moving their trusted uk bank overseas with them
1379650 graduates the opportunity to benefit from unique travel deals should they wish to take a well earned break after graduation
1379651 this is not a general policy each case is assessed on its own merits
1379652 clearly people are anticipating further rate rises and are wanting to lock into the certainty that a fixed rate mortgage provides
1379653 having reviewed the evidence and advice from the oft we believe that these price controls are no longer appropriate
1379654 they were intended to be temporary and have now been in place for over four years during this period other significant banks such as hbos abbey and alliance amp leicester have competed more strongly for sme customers and improved their market position
1379655 smes have raised their expectations of what banks should provide and are more likely to consider switching if they do not get what they want they are therefore better placed to constrain the actions of the four banks which were subject to the price controls barclays hsbc lloyds tsb and the royal bank of scotland group
1379656 generation spend is allowing debt to dictate behaviour rather than taking financial control and keeping a check on debts
1379657 our research reveals an encouraging awareness amongst women to branch away from their stereotypical image of spend a holics
1379658 just over half 51 of our customers are female and the number is growing by recognising the need to ensure they have control over their finances women are better able to have a secure financial future
1379659 for many borrowing money is as easy as walking through a doorway but its a good idea to ensure that you have a way out before the door slams shut
1379660 simple measures such as shielding your pin with your free hand whenever you enter it into a keypad will significantly reduce your chances of becoming a victim of fraud
1379661 it is certainly time for some of the high street players to see that they cant continue to rest on their laurels
1379662 we will be doing further promotional work over the summer and autumn in the run up to the launch of the first annual report in september
1379663 more work to do to reach new parents and to encourage the active involvement of those parents whose child has an account
1379664 many people fail to take their first step in banking because they feel intimidated and unwanted
1379665 it seems inequitable that you will pay back money to some consumers just because they are prepared to be persistent
1379666 saving is a good habit if you can afford it
1379667 people are now realising this is something that is real
1379668 its not a gimmicky thing that is only for financial nerds but a straightforward process anyone can follow in order to claim a refund that is potentially worth thousands of pounds
1379669 what is emerging very clearly is that the banks have been allowed to get away for a very long time with excessive and unjustified charges whose legality is doubtful
1379670 we have calculated that every customer is now paying something like an average of 320 a year to bank shareholders
1379671 the uk is pretty much unique in the developed world in offering free banking to those with a balance and an agreed overdraft that works to the advantage of the overwhelming number of customers
1379672 a fall in household disposable money is the most likely factor in pushing down the mood to spend
1379673 it seems that money issues remain an uncomfortable subject for many couples
1379674 these packages were just dumped on my doorstep one day
1379675 the bank did not have a clue they had left them in my house or their contents
1379676 we will take steps to ensure there is no security issue for customers as a result of this matter
1379677 it would appear that hbos has been negligent with bank statements which contain important personal information about their customers

1379679 to ensure the tax and regulatory system will encourage the development of sharia compliant products
1379680 the 50 plus market hold 60 per cent of all savings and are responsible for over 40 per cent of all consumer demand
1379681 inertia creeps in when it comes to switching current accounts
1379682 a weekly withdrawal would typically cost 91 a year which for the lowest earning ten per cent of households is a whole weeks income
1379683 local action is crucial but also needs the weight of a national campaign to put pressure on the government and providers of services
1379684 something unreal is happening to the consumer who has tried over the past year to manage finances better
1379685 banks are employing increasingly underhand methods to avoid their responsibility to treat their customers fairly
1379686 it is entirely reasonable for a bank to close the account of a customer where it is clear that the relationship between the customer and the bank has broken down
1379687 the banking industry handles over seven billion transactions a year and occasionally something will go wrong thats human nature
1379688 the popularity of internet banking is at an all time high
1379689 risks in this area inevitably evolve quickly and our responses have to match them
1379690 low tech breaches of security such as the careless disposal of sensitive data
1379691 a decision to close invariably reflects a long term decline in customer use of the branch
1379692 the research shows a really positive shift in attitudes towards financial management
1379693 while people acknowledge that money wont buy happiness theyre realising that it can get in the way
1379694 fears about the impact of the credit squeeze on consumer spending and the housing market has eroded the value of debt issued to fund private equity acquisitions of companies stretching from retail to property
1379695 christmas is becoming increasingly expensive and some surveys are showing the uk is set to spend over 400 this year on presents alone add to that other costs food drink petrol for visiting the relatives and the bill can easily top 1 000
1379696 with the help of our christmas saver people can save a little each month and avoid adding a financial headache to their new year hangover
1379697 the discipline of only having access to your money from november 25 onwards means our savers really will be having a merrier christmas
1379698 half the country will be very anxious about the safety of their family and the security and the whole country will be wondering how on earth the government allowed this to happen
1379699 there is no need for customers to ask for a new account or to contact their bank or building society there is no evidence of an increase in suspicious activity on those customers accounts since the data was mislaid on october 18
1379700 the person in possession of these discs has names addresses dates of birth national insurance numbers and bank account details everything needed to conduct a massive fraud
1379701 this will clearly be a worrying time for many people hopefully the data will not get in the hands of fraudsters but we still recommend that people check their bank account records for any irregular activity
1379702 egg money is in a strong product proposition though it is not market leading in all aspects it does offer consistently good rates and is likely to suit those who may end up dipping in and out of both spending and borrowing facilities
1379703 these figures should be treated with cautious optimism although its good news to see that savings are significantly higher than new borrowing the savings brake shows that we are still contradicting ourselves financially
1379704 hopefully 2005 will see a reduction in the high levels of consumer debt that have swept the country in recent years and an increase in regular savers
1379705 we are delighted to enter in to partnership with eurogiro it means that visa direct customers can send money to those who dont even have a visa card
1379706 hsbc thinks that its as important to offer financial advice to the young entrepreneurs of tomorrow as it is to help the undergraduates of today
1379707 nearly one in ten young workers are already earning over 20 000 a year thats just 1 400 less than the average graduate starting salary at 21 years old so its no wonder that so many bright young people are actively choosing to get into working life as soon as possible
1379708 with all the effort and energy that goes into organising a wedding it would be a shame not to do the same when it comes to choosing the most competitive finance package to pay for it
1379709 shopping around to get a good deal could ultimately impact your overall wedding plans and whether you can afford a honeymoon in skegness or the seychelles
1379710 hsbc thinks that its important to offer advice to young entrepreneurs of tomorrow as it helps the undergraduates of today find their feet
1379711 having early access to your account is invaluable as a student
1379712 it allows student loan payments to be made quickly giving swifter access to cash for all those student essentials this can alleviate some of the financial pressure felt when leaving home for the first time
1379713 were passing on the interest rate benefits to our plus customers
1379714 incentives such as free travel insurance are typically only offered on accounts that charge a monthly fee but with alliance amp leicester free really does mean free
1379715 moving abroad is a very big step and there are many things to consider
1379716 whilst many people realise how much theyll miss their home comforts many fail to consider some other important decisions altogether including their banking arrangements its something you might regret later if you end up losing out financially
1379717 more people may be inclined to save when interest rates are higher
1379718 record levels of consumer satisfaction in the independent financial advice experience reveal that the ifa brand is stronger than ever these figures clearly highlight that independent financial advice remains a crucial element in consumers financial planning

1379723 most people have two or three bank accounts dotted around
1379724 not only is there an opportunity to do useful things in foreign currencies but they can actually do some of those very mundane things you need to do like pay some of the bills back in the uk
1379725 this can be a costly labour of love when you take into account season tickets motorway lunches match day programmes and of course petrol
1379726 people only tend to become wise to debt when the debt catches up with them i think that interest rates have gone up and people are feeling the pinch with mortgage rates and debt across the board
1379727 its a sad fact that the burden of proof is on the individual
1379728 first direct customers will be the first in britain to try out video banking from their mobile
1379729 our aim is to create services that use cutting edge technology to meet real customer needs
1379730 if savers ensure they put money aside for unexpected costs savings accounts can survive winter unscathed
1379731 very costly even for just a few basic transactions every month
1379732 seemingly inevitable move towards paying for the majority of full service current accounts
1379733 delinquency alcohol and substance abuse poor school performance theft and truancy
1379734 with two members of the mpc having voted for an increase in the base at the october meeting many people have assumed that a rise in rate in november is a near certainty
1379735 but the governor of the bank of england has made it clear that a rise is not a done deal and that the balance between supply and demand remains even
1379736 the banks help children build up confidence in handling money
1379737 hsbc has listened and responded to the needs of the leicester business community including the many new local businesses we helped get started this year
1379738 our aim is to make this the most customer friendly and successful commercial centre in the leicester area additional banking facilities will also be available with dedicated staff on hand so that personal customers can make good use of the centre as well
1379739 the pace of scottish economic growth is set to accelerate in the final quarter of 2006 and into 2007
1379740 we are immensely proud of this award in recognition of the contribution the kiosks have made to the working of our branches
1379741 the sheer volume of use of the kiosks in the first year alone shows that they are extremely popular with our customers who appreciate their ease of use and speed
1379742 any money that they building societies make is then returned to the peoples accounts with them so it is not actually in their interest to rip customers off
1379743 there are now more savings accounts paying at least five per cent interest than there have been for a number of years
1379744 the royal bank of scotland offers 73 different currencies and nine types of travellers cheques one of the widest selections available in the uk
1379745 with our new online and telephone ordering channels planning your holiday is just that much easier

1379747 we have a commitment to the shared goal of making significant progress towards halving the number of adults in households without a bank account by november 2006
1379748 the ability to open a bank account is a fundamental step for young people in becoming financially independent and capable
1379749 but many young people do not have all the documents that banks require to open even the most straightforward bank account
1379750 this rate is nearly double the average of 2 86 per cent
1379751 this goes to show how all savers have a duty to review their accounts regularly
1379752 make your money work as hard as possible for you
1379753 make sure your authorised limit is big enough and if it isnt tell your bank before you go over the limit
1379754 financial products are complicated and there can be too much jargon we should extend the benefits of generic advice to all consumers who need it
1379755 this is a real chance to tackle the 1 4 million debt problems which poured into our bureaux last year
1379756 britains kids are certainly doing well in the pocket money stakes especially those in yorkshire where pocket money rates are at a premium its encouraging that most children are learning the value of money by having to earn their pocket money its also great to see that theyre saving almost half of their pocket money each week
1379757 exams are a standard objective trusted and recognised test of competence across the industry
1379758 how will firms prove competence against what benchmark will competence be determined
1379759 at the moment exams provide individuals with a passport which helps labour mobility between firms and countries how will people move jobs if this passport is now removed
1379760 isas are one of the most effective ways of saving for the future as they are free from income tax and we welcome todays decision to extend the current isa limits
1379761 while todays announcement is a very welcome move we would like to see permanent protection for isa limits as we feel this would encourage even more people to benefit from tax free savings
1379762 many people stick with a current account throughout their working lives so its important they make the right choice at the outset
1379763 our research shows that more than 1 1 billion in cash is spent each week on every day items this is great news for the millions of newsagents pubs and corner shops throughout the uk that thrive on these purchases
1379764 whilst card payments are increasing our research shows that the great british public believes cash is still king
1379765 our team of experienced financial researchers analysed all data collected from the industry over the last year we not only looked at how competitive products were but also at clarity and fairness
1379766 it is probably something they wouldnt go shopping to look for but while they are shopping they might think thats a good idea then they dont have to make a separate trip to the bank
1379767 many of the services being packaged as benefits in the lloyds tsb gold service and barclays additions plus account are not used by customers
1379768 with more people choosing to retire abroad or simply purchase a holiday home its vital they obtain the very best rates and services available to them
1379769 this will ensure their hard earned cash is not eaten away in unnecessary fees and commission
1379770 our outstanding customer service has traditionally been delivered by telephone
1379771 however the success of our internet service means that 80 per cent of our customer contact is now online
1379772 the podcast is just the latest example of how first direct is embracing new ways of communicating with customers
1379773 we anticipate that friday 26th may could well be another record day in many places
1379774 it is also the last friday of the month and a bank holiday weekend so people will be stocking up on cash to last them through the extra day
1379775 as always on bank holidays warm sunny days fuel the appetite for cash
1379776 people head out for shopping or go out with friends and family so an improvement in the weather forecast may be needed to break the record
1379777 logging on to your internet banking account gives you immediate 24 hour access to the up to date status of your finances
1379778 you can keep track of your in and out goings which means you have a clearer idea of where you stand and so can easily avoid going into the red by mistake
1379779 with british tourists expected to take over 61 million overseas trips this year a saving like this could save the nation almost 1 2 billion
1379780 enough to send 3 9 million people or everyone in merseyside birmingham and essex to egypt for 14 nights in a five star hotel
1379781 during the last 12 months fluctuations in exchange rates mean that some preferred holiday destinations no longer offer the value for money they once did
1379782 however whilst some rates have fallen many long haul destinations continue to offer great or improved value for money and travelling further afield may prove more cost effective for your holiday spending
1379783 if ordinary members have joined the building society its because they have been living in the mutuality they want to look into the future
1379784 open accounts with low sums just to get windfalls when the building society is taken over
1379785 although i would never want it recession and high inflation would be the easiest solution
1379786 the new arrangements reflect the importance that financial institutions place on fraud prevention
1379787 although the instances where fraud has occurred in these particular circumstances are fortunately few it is crucial that the industry continues to make life for the criminal as difficult as possible
1379788 if consumers are unhappy with their current account provider they should research other products on offer and switch to one that better suits their needs
1379789 traditionally opening a bank account has been one of the most trying aspects of setting up home for the first time in the uk passport is a relocation service that provides the essentials to make the move as smooth and straightforward as possible
1379790 the most extensive online experience of any high street bank
1379791 internet banking forms a cornerstone of hsbcs efforts to respond to the changing needs of 21st century businesses
1379792 with 51 per cent of britains 1 7 million small to medium sized enterprises expected to bank direct by 2010 demand for internet banking is clear and were leading the way
1379793 students need to be particularly alert when they are withdrawing cash as charges to access their own money quickly add up and hit hard in the pocket of people already facing the challenge of making ends meet while they are studying
1379794 packaged accounts are proving popular with customers and banks and are likely to remain so however the average credit interest paid on accounts is not particularly impressive at 1 5 per cent so customers must really value the added extras
1379795 there are now more people with a mobile phone than a landline making it the worlds must have communications device
1379796 the launch of monilink supports our drive to give customers the widest choice of ways to control their money
1379797 this new research shows that some people still arent doing all they should to protect themselves which hand in hand with a large increase in phishing email attacks at the start of the year leads us to expect an increase in online banking fraud losses in the first half of 2006
1379798 whilst working hard to make money and grow their companies they are neglecting to review how their hard earned cash is treated
1379799 this new fangled allegiance to saving is all well and good but only if we show equal commitment to controlling our debts
1379800 people are beginning to take heed of repeated calls to start saving but seem to be eliminating spending and borrowing behaviour from their budgetary considerations
1379801 our customers are telling us that they want free access to their cash in convenient locations
1379802 which is why were increasing our atm estate from around 2 900 to over 3 400
1379803 were also responding to concerns about access to free atms in britain and have committed to installing free machines in a number of areas that lack them
1379804 its not always possible to install hole in the wall style machines or to put them in local stores so the phone booth atms offer us a fantastic option for providing this service to customers and communities
1379805 we would urge people to think carefully about a realistic amount they can set aside each month so they avoid regularly plundering their account
1379806 we are responding to the need for a safe and convenient way for people to put money aside for christmas we have been working on this for many months to get the best scheme possible for our customers to provide them with a way to save small regular amounts which ensures their cash is fully protected and looked after securely for the year until they need it at christmas
1379807 very often they pay when an unexpected event happens like an unauthorised unexpected overdraft
1379808 fundamental change in the behaviour of banks in the market place
1379809 they reflect the market and are clearly shown within our literature
1379810 we encourage our customers to regularly check their balance to ensure they avoid inadvertently becoming overdrawn
1379811 we also encourage them to establish an authorised overdraft to avoid charges for becoming unauthorised overdrawn
1379812 young peoples financial needs will typically be very different from those of their parents and so they owe it to themselves to make the best decision for their circumstances
1379813 disappointing that so many young people dont give greater thought to who they bank with when they start work
1379814 the uk savings market is crammed with complicated products which often hide the real rate of interest given
1379815 banks and building societies must provide simple products with total transparency giving straightforward rates and good service
1379816 local banks are still ripping off customers by charging massive amounts for their services
1379817 northern ireland consumers have been suffering overcharging by local banks for years and it is time that regulation authorities stepped in to investigate local practices
1379818 occasionally people do need to use their overdraft and it is unacceptable that such severe penalties are levelled at some customers
1379819 internet banking is as safe as any other form of banking the banks use strong encryptions and you do have a pin number you have security numbers
1379820 no one is going to be able to hack through the security systems to get to your internet bank account unless you do something stupid like send a reply to one of these emails handing out your details
1379821 our strategy is to provide quality products in a way that customers find convenient and easy to use and a strong online presence is central to us maintaining this
1379822 people are becoming increasingly time poor and this has been a significant factor behind the growth of online banking and supermarket banking in general

1379831 we do what we can and constantly improve our technology
1379832 but we need to explain to customers about protecting their pc
1379833 it is not visible fraud so people are a bit more complacent
1379834 it is similar to the car crime campaigns lock the doors on your pc
1379835 lenders are increasingly charging higher rates for people who have been bankrupt
1379836 it might be difficult to get the job you want especially in the financial industry
1379837 landlords can see it as well and it may be difficult to get a flat
1379838 an increase in complaints to the bcsb simply shows that the public are becoming more aware of the watchdog
1379839 a proportion of the calls are simply enquiries not complaints about individual banks
1379840 our research confounds the stereotype that young people are spendthrift and irresponsible with their finances
1379841 student loans are their largest commitment and whilst the interest on these are low it still seems to constrain their appetite for other debt
1379842 the interest burden of this age group is not out of line with older groups
1379843 not many people are aware of the delinquent fees their bank charges them for
1379844 sometimes banks charge more than they should do but some charging is inevitable and fair
1379845 it is hoped financial education is something that can be added to a social skills lesson
1379846 this could provide something they can take away with them not just a maths lesson
1379847 we want people to realise this is not just a personal finance thing but the wider aspect of having something to eat and money to spend
1379848 you can talk over what you need and your circumstances
1379849 of course as youd expect from profit making businesses and because cash machines cost money to place maintain and keep secure they levy a charge at many of their machines
1379850 but the key for us as consumers is that we know when we are paying for that convenience so we can make a choice our latest figures confirm that we know exactly which machines charge and vote with our feet
1379851 meeting the changing needs of modern families means making major financial sacrifices which affect lifestyle expectations and often leave the breadwinner with just half of their monthly income
1379852 take the fear factor out of opening a bank account for customers new to the uk
1379853 the world will not come to an end and the markets will recover

1379858 we have designed both these products to help encourage children and young people to start to save and understand the value of money from an early age
1379859 we think the competitive rate plus an attractive bonus will provide youngsters with the incentive to take out the accounts and save for their future
1379860 the traditional high street banks are quite prepared to shower new students with incentives but what about the poor value current accounts they offer to students hard pressed parents
1379861 alliance amp leicester is offering market leading credit interest and overdraft rates and free travel insurance todays current accounts are not all the same and there has never been a better time to switch
1379862 annual gym memberships that last only as long as new years resolutions magazine subscriptions that are never read and other poor value investments mean that britons literally waste millions of pounds a year
1379863 we would encourage britons to think twice before signing up to a service or product you may regret a few months later the best value direct debit would be one that goes directly into a savings account
1379864 most people know that 1 000 buys much less today than it would have ten years ago yet when it comes to saving for the future the majority of people seem to be disregarding the impact that future inflation will have on their investments
1379865 this is why we have been giving inflation beating savings a face lift the new customer literature and services will combat confusion and make it easier for savers to consider the affects of future inflation and ensure their savings will outgrow it whatever happens
1379866 as a practising accountant i agree with the findings of the alliance amp leicester commercial bank research reporting the views of my fellow accountants
1379867 it is vital that businesses regularly review their banking arrangements and the charges they pay as they may be paying far more than they have to and could get a better deal elsewhere
1379868 parents have embraced the concept of saving for their children on a regular basis and we are delighted with the positive response to childrens regular saver
1379869 this account makes regular saving for a childs future an option for everyone by paying the best rate available even on small monthly deposits

1379872 although it is sensible to keep some money easily accessible for emergencies if you really are serious about having a long term saving plan it is best to avoid temptation by putting your cash into a place where you cant just dip in on a whim such as for the summer sales
1379873 moneymood indicates that each household should put by around 500 of emergency money that they can easily get hold of to prepare for just this sort of event
1379874 the pressure on household finances appears to be quite high this would clearly have an influence on whether people are in the mood to spend or save the mood is unlikely to change until households get some relief for their finances
1379875 this deal is a significant step towards achieving our vision of free cash access for all from any type of bank account at post office branches
1379876 the changes to our interest rates reflect movements in the market this trend has meant that many of our competitors have also had to reduce rates over the past two to three months
1379877 our research demonstrates that the phenomenon of the last minute holiday splurge results from holidaymakers trying to use up their cash on the final day of their holiday
1379878 with almost three quarters of people regretting their holiday purchases we are reminding uk travellers of the benefits of keeping hold of their currency and changing it back when they return home

1379884 retirement seems a long way off when you are in your late 20s or early 30s but if you dont start planning for your pension in time it will have a serious effect on your future lifestyle
1379885 for the one in ten who appear to actually achieve their goals then its definitely worthwhile
1379886 and for the rest of us its better to try but fail than not to try at all
1379887 once again hsbc has proven that big banks can offer great value moneyfacts ranked hsbc a whopping 21 places higher than the next best high street bank in fact borrowers with a mortgage at the lowest rated lender are wasting almost 2 000 in annual interest compared to hsbcs offer
1379888 whats more hsbc is the only one of the nations ten largest mortgage lenders to make it into moneyfacts top five
1379889 even though the bank of england today announced that base rate would remain at 4 50 per cent savers should not be complacent believing that their savings account will remain untouched and should continue to shop around for the best deal
1379890 in addition to the already reported reductions from ing natwest rbs woolwich west bromwich bs and scarborough bs this week we have seen cuts from abbey alliance amp leicester lloyds tsb and manchester bs
1379891 it is encouraging to see that so many people are able to pay for christmas from their savings rather than going into debt
1379892 for those who have chosen to borrow money to fund christmas now is a good time to review how they will pay off that debt and to check if they could get a better deal by switching their credit card or by taking out a personal loan
1379893 although there have been many reports of six figure bonuses in the city it seems that the majority of people are not expecting a year end bonus
1379894 back in may we pledged to speed up internet and telephone payments but the uk banking industry has now decided to go a giant stride beyond this to give customers a service whose speed and convenience is world class
1379895 our new system will enable customers to use the internet or phone to make a payment that will reach the recipients bank account within a few hours
1379896 building society savings increased by 25 per cent between november 2003 and november 2005
1379897 this is perhaps evidence of the growing acceptance by people that they need to save so they have something to fall back on in case hard times hit
1379898 cash savings not only pay for unforeseen expenses such as the car breaking down or the roof springing a leak but also form part of a balanced portfolio to ensure a comfortable retirement
1379899 the general acceptance of buying goods or services online means that the web is now a mainstream and vital channel for businesses to interact with and sell to customers
1379900 websites act as a shop front and are increasingly the customers primary contact with a brand
1379901 having a child is a very exciting time but for first time parents they often underestimate the true cost of having a baby
1379902 this is why we urge people to take steps to save as soon as possible especially if they are set to lose part of their regular monthly income during maternity
1379903 despite the older generation admitting they splash out on their grandchildren it isnt all frittered away on expensive gifts

1379905 decembers data shows that consumers are not expecting the interest rate cuts that are starting to be called for by some within the industry and increasingly expected by the financial markets
1379906 with the latest pmi figures showing service sector growth rising faster than expected making a recovery in economic growth in 2006 is more likely they may be right
1379907 the internet has become an important life tool playing an increasing role in the way we conduct our daily affairs whether its shopping booking a holiday or sorting our finances
1379908 websites act as a shop front and are increasingly the customers primary contact with a brand
1379909 automated services are great for consumers who want speedy access to information and fantastic news for banks that are looking to improve operational efficiency as well as customer service
1379910 personal service remains vital however and banks forget this at their peril
1379911 its nice to see that traditional christmas spends have become more affordable over the last 20 years hopefully making the christmas pound go further
1379912 people need to make sure that they know whether or not the cash machines they use charge for making withdrawals
1379913 we learned that these people want a service that doesnt just talk about treating them like an individual but actually does
1379914 most of us feel the financial pinch at christmas or just after therefore as it makes sense to keep an eye on spending and talk to your bank the moment you realise you might be getting into difficulty not after
1379915 the increasingly heavy penalties for going into the red without permission also emphasise the importance of carefully researching what you actually need from a current account
1379916 while accumulating a treasure trove of toys many of which do not last a month many children are not being given the benefit of real treasure savings that will be a real help to them in the future they are toy rich cash poor
1379917 if parents asked for the value of just three gifts an average of 50 to be put into a savings plan every year for a child from age one the money could grow to more than 1 400 in 17 years time
1379918 every child will be grateful for a financial head start in adult life and this christmas present will last long after the tree is down and the turkey eaten
1379919 christmas is always the busiest time of the year for cash withdrawals and this year looks no exception
1379920 on the busiest shopping days we expect over one million link transactions per hour with around half a million pounds dispensed per minute
1379921 we believe that many muslim families have been unable to use their childs voucher because there hasnt been a suitable product on the market
1379922 what is vital for these families is that they act now so their child isnt allocated an account thats not shariah compliant
1379923 there are an alarming number of people with serious debts which they find difficult to repay the pressure to spend at christmas is almost certain to add to the uks debt burden
1379924 debt advisors are already braced for a surge in pleas for help next month when people realise the scale of their problems after christmas
1379925 while womens salaries are slowly catching up with mens most women are still doing more than their fair share of the chores around the home
1379926 our research shows that over half of women are responsible for paying the bills and 44 per cent admit they still take on a disproportionate amount of housework compared to their partner
1379927 with these road shows we want to be able to show people the products and services we are now offering muslims but we also want to give people the chance to air their views and ask questions of our panel of experts
1379928 islamic banking is only just beginning in the uk but lloyds tsb is proud to be playing its part in making these services available to more people across the country
1379929 we believe it is important to offer great products and services to parents and children so that future generations are financially aware
1379930 which recognise the efforts by our colleagues to make halifax branches as welcoming as possible for parents and their children
1379931 there are now more than one million indians living and working in the uk
1379932 many british indians have businesses investments properties and families back home which they continue to finance
1379933 the indian banking service is designed with the needs of this community in mind and should help people across the uk get the most out of their money
1379934 we believe the new security measures will ease peoples fears surrounding internet banking and encourage more people to bank online
1379935 the link atm scheme is committed to full transparency of charges at cash machines that surcharge
1379936 the rapid growth of charging cash machines is hitting consumers in the pocket and making huge profits for the operators
1379937 we want to see further transparency improvements including standardised signs on all cash machines so that consumers can see at a glance whether or not they will be charged
1379938 having worked with mobile operators and banks for over three years to develop this network we are excited to have one of the worlds largest and most innovative banks leading the service to market
1379939 the uk is a centre of excellence for banking and mobile technology so its fitting that we are launching our first network in the uk with industry leaders that have global reach
1379940 we live in a culture where people are more prepared to buy what they want when they want and pay for it later
1379941 debt is not necessarily bad but bad debt is bad
1379942 im hoping well be giving a sizeable cheque to our charitable foundation so that we may support local charities and good causes that matter to our members in areas where they live and work
1379943 overdrafts were originally developed to give customers a safety net and more flexibility to cover short term cash flow issues
1379944 however increasingly people are regarding them as an extension of their salary and in doing so they are at risk of building up high levels of debt and paying too much for their borrowing
1379945 the cost of living is rising faster than the government admits
1379946 we hope people will log on to moneytalk to find out and get useful hints and tips from which about how to make the most of their money
1379947 the use of personal cheques dropped last year for the tenth year running and customers now prefer quicker and easier payment methods
1379948 it is very clear that the cheque is no longer the main payment method and based on the current rate of decline they are likely to virtually disappear within the next 20 years cash and debit cards are clearly the preferred method of payment in the uk today
1379949 some institutions are offering attractive free gifts but with the number of accounts on offer it is crucial that students also take into consideration crucial account features such as overdraft rates and limits
1379950 todays current accounts are not all the same and most banking customers are not getting the best deal available there has never been a better time to switch
1379951 there are so many elements to a modern bank account which could make it worthwhile for customers to switch
1379952 customers should always make sure that they shop around to get the best deal possible looking at the headline credit interest rate considering the rate they are paying on their overdraft and what other benefits they could be getting
1379953 this account offers two excellent guarantees combined with the flexibility of access to the funds with a minimum investment of only 5 000 the direct bonus tracker will be an excellent addition to any investment portfolio
1379954 alliance amp leicesters fee free premier plus account has consistently offered a market leading credit interest rate and highly competitive overdraft rates since it was launched nearly a year ago
1379955 taking this into consideration alongside the first class customer service offered by alliance amp leicester premier plus emerged as the clear and deserved winner of best current account 2005
1379956 the premise that retailers hoteliers and other cash handling businesses are all about loose change is a myth
1379957 with over a quarter of businesses seeing typical cash transactions of more than 80 cash still has a major role to play
1379958 it is crucial that these businesses have the right cash handling facilities in place to ensure that they are paying minimum fees and earning maximum interest on the cash they bank
1379959 there remains a great deal of confusion about the switching process and yet there are now so many great accounts available all of which easily beat those offered by the big four
1379960 switching these days really is a simple and painless process
1379961 we are not only seeing the emergence of a generation of young consumers but also keen cyber consumers
1379962 if you want your newborn to keep you in the manner to which you have become accustomed to in your old age you should consider the latest list of high earners names
1379963 the new rules are a step in the right direction but nationwide would still like consumers to be able to see at a glance if a machine charges
1379964 day by day consumers right to access cash for free is being eroded by the rapid growth in charging machines and by the fact that there is no cap on the charges
1379965 the step by step saver offers a great rate to customers with the security of a fixed rate and access to the funds if needed
1379966 users are working on the internet and banking insecurely except when they have to approve a transaction they reach and hit accept on the trusted device
1379967 creation of additional growth options both at home and internationally and our ability to deliver integration benefits from acquisitions
1379968 the muslim community is one of the fastest growing in the uk and is very much part of the fabric of british life
1379969 our research shows that over three quarters of british muslims want banking services that fit with their faith and thats exactly what we aim to provide beginning with our new current account
1379970 our 20 offer to internet users may catch the eye but applicants will soon find the value of the other premier plus benefits quickly mount up
1379971 millions of people may as well take 15 out of their bank account each week and give it to a complete stranger that is the net result of their forgetfulness
1379972 in times when savings and retirement planning are rarely out of the news the money frittered away each month would start to address the nations savings shortfall
1379973 if i were still a poacher id have a real job defending these charges
1379974 they do not appear to be related to the costs they frequently hit those least able to pay them and they generate great resentment
1379975 this business has huge potential we can now realise this using santanders strength and placing a strong emphasis on execution
1379976 these findings show that consumers are looking for the flexibility to manage their savings at a time and in a manner which is most convenient to them
1379977 the introduction of the offshore 60 plus account enhances our range of savings offers enabling us to satisfy the requirements of all deposit based investors
1379978 owners of cash machines that charge are now collecting 140 million a year in fees from consumers which is more than double the amount uk consumers paid for withdrawals in the previous year
1379979 we hope a code of practice can be devised which will make it easier for consumers to differentiate between charging and free machines and which will ensure consumers are treated fairly
1379980 sir trevor would make an ideal bank manager as he combines intelligence with approachability and a friendly down to earth manner that people can easily relate to
1379981 its encouraging to see that people are not only getting into the habit of putting money aside on a monthly basis but are also planning to increase the amounts they save and invest
1379982 there are some great rates available at the moment and consumers can reap real benefits from putting some of their cash by each month
1379983 the suggestion that only five per cent of cash machine transactions will ever incur a fee is a misconception experience from the us illustrates that it could go much higher
1379984 the rising number of charging machines has serious social consequences
1379985 the uk continued to enjoy high levels of employment and while property prices softened the market remained resilient
1379986 indeed buoyant domestic housing markets were a significant factor in most economies where they contributed to continued economic activity by bolstering consumer confidence and releasing equity to fund spending growth
1379987 they have met their numbers but that has come from associates and low bad debts
1379988 nationwide places great importance on developing innovative new ways to further improve the services we provide to our members
1379989 the banks are making record profits estimated at more than 30 000 every minute of every day and it is no wonder that consumers feel that they are not getting a fair deal
1379990 clearly we are not saying that all profit is bad
1379991 if people are looking to save money on their day to day finances switching current account has never been easier at nationwide its really straightforward to switch accounts you can do it in just 10 minutes and get a great deal
1379992 the launch of premier regular saver has really made waves in the current account market and is proving extremely popular
1379993 alliance amp leicesters premier and premier direct current accounts are recognised as being amongst the best on the market by far and this savings account makes it even more attractive to switch
1379994 im sure finding the money to buy decorations on top of the cost of christmas when you have recently bought a house is an expense first time buyers could do without
1379995 but its worth people bearing in mind that good decorations can also last for many christmas to come so they should opt for durability where possible
1379996 many of us dream about finding our ideal partner and having a fabulous wedding but are not necessarily aware of the costs involved
1379997 starting a savings fund early can save a lot of money in the long term and also help get a new marriage off to a happier start without the pressure of debt
1379998 we think the moneymood of the nation is still firmly in save mode despite the usual appearance of christmas goods everywhere to tempt us
1379999 perhaps the fact that inflation hit an eight year high in september and the news that interest rates are likely to remain on hold has taken the edge off the mood to spend
