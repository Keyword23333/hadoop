1800000 i have also thought of the summer before my second year before you got the diary of the time just before you were taken in to the chamber of secrets perhaps i can either stop you from being taken into the chamber or destroy that worthless diary i also thought of the summer between my second and third years and of the end of my third year
1800001 alright lets see now end of third year good thing is i still wanted everything to work out and both of us to get together bad things are you were concentrating on saving sirius from the dementors and also buckbeak from the malfoys scheme of course the most important is oh never mind and thus you were so busy that you had no time to notice me it was not long after that that i gave up on an us by the time we left for summer holidays i felt almost normal around you good bye crush would i have let you into my heart at that time i am not sure but still a definite option none the less
1800002 the summer before your second year now that is just too weird to consider i would have to say definitely out of the question the crush i had on you was so bad i would freak out if you even said hello to me it would have been a problem for most of that year
1800003 as desperately as i would love to have never obtained that diary a part of me still feels that i cant truly help you without going through that after all i am the only other person to survive after tom tried to kill me so that will have to be a definite no
1800004 the summer between your second and third year might make for an interesting choice i can see distinct possibilities you would be at the dursleys for most of the summer and though i still had a crush on you i was able to talk to you on the train ride home without blushing too much i can see us exchanging letters as friends but that might still cause awkward situations with my family i think that is one of the better choices though so ill write it down
1800005 finally the time just before the end of your second year around the time of the chamber incident harry im sure i remember hermione saying something about a time of rest so your younger body can adjust to the presence of your older soul what if you dont wake in time to save me from the chamber i doubt that would be good so i want to say no to that date
1800006 umm ginny i think that would be the best date to use
1800007 but harry what if you cant save me remember that i will be depending on you to save me
1800008 because we need to be certain that our younger selves will have enough time to get to be friends before having to get married that and i can make a few changes that will be of more help to us in dealing with tom for good
1800009 harry please listen to me i dont think it would be a good idea what if you awoke too late to rescue me from the chamber
1800010 did tom ever tell you why he chose you as the bait for that trap
1800011 no he just said that i would be responsible for your death and laughed when i begged him to spare you even if i died
1800012 i knew the world would need your protection and i was so insignificant tom had to be stopped and you were the one who had stopped him before he said that i was wasting my time to have faith in you and that you would never want some little nobody like me
1800013 you were unconscious when he told me this but it should have some meaning tom told me that he had given up trying to kill muggle born students ever since you told him about me
1800014 he said that when i got the diary it was like a dream come true for him but then you took it back
1800015 if my memory is correct that was not the only item taken from my trunk over the years
1800016 if you say so ginny but i think you would look nice in that old quidditch practice jersey of mine you know the one that
1800017 well back to the tale tom wanted to meet me and learn about the means i used to destroy his older self he wanted me and though he did not know it his choice of a bait for his trap was the best he could have made
1800018 i think that if i go back to two weeks before the chamber i can be awake and ready to rescue the fair maiden now are there any other dates that you can think of
1800019 i remember when hermione was giving her explanation earlier she said that the length of time i would need should be no more than one week to ten days i am thinking of at least two weeks but you can make it three to be certain i can be up and around in time to recover you from the chamber
1800020 harry i dont know why you would be so adamant about returning to that time period what makes it more appealing to you than the others
1800021 why cant i get you to understand that i am scared of you failing to reach me in time i dont know
1800022 this particular time will give me the best chance of changing the most events with the least unnecessary effects on the final result i want to get through this time period without dealing with the dursleys and also without having to try convincing dumbledore that i can be trusted especially when i will be unable to defend myself against his prying questions before i am prepared for them
1800023 i know i will be unable to modify most things but some events will be changeable siriuss escape and the events of my third year among them i want to arrange to get sirius a better and more comfortable hiding place than the shrieking shack
1800024 you need to lie back and settle down to sleep we can finish this discussion later
1800025 it seems so familiar but i cant remember where i heard it
1800026 but you must go to sleep your body needs its rest and you are not getting it by constantly talking
1800027 thank you madam pomfrey it was my favourite when i was a child and mum always had such a beautiful singing voice i guess i inherited more than just her temper
1800028 that is truer than you can imagine young lady now please get your school work finished quickly i need you to do some tasks for me concerning mr potter later today
1800029 well i must say he is sure sleeping for someone who has been resting for the last month i hope he will be up and about soon i am worried that it took so long for him to heal
1800030 i was also he really needs to be more careful so hermione is there anything new for arthur and me to deal with
1800031 so i didnt see you and ronald sneaking out of that broom closet an hour ago
1800032 we had hoped to keep it secret for a few weeks in case harry woke and wanted to know what he missed we could say we just got together that day
1800033 i think harry will be angrier with you for trying to hide it from those that care about you
1800034 i wonder how long it will be before we have to worry about you and harry sneaking into a
1800035 this is not the way i would like to be having this conversation
1800036 i know it isnt much ginny but you and harry will be together sooner in the new timeline i mean after all you will have a lot to work out before you get married
1800037 i just wish there was a way that harry and i could get married this time as well
1800038 i guess what is so upsetting is the years of waiting for both of us to recognize in the other what we both wanted we wasted so much time that we could have had together and now that we are starting to have that relationship the most we will get to do is hold hands and maybe snog a few times
1800039 i wish harry and i could get married before the ritual is preformed isnt there something that can be arranged
1800040 all students are to return to their common rooms and all staff members and aurors are to report to the entrance hall the hospital wing should prepare for casualties we are under attack by death eaters
1800041 may i sit and talk with you for a brief while harry
1800042 of course sir i dont mind wave up a chair and join me for a cuppa
1800043 harry it has come to my attention that you have asked miss granger to prepare the necessary arithmantic equations to take you back further than the chosen date for this time ritual
1800044 sir there are a great many problems with the date you chose the first problem i face is that i only have a few months to get you to accept that the prophecy is real and the second is that ginny and i will barely have time to start a worthwhile relationship to build a marriage on if i remember correctly wizarding marriages are for life no changing your mind i want us to have the best chance of being happy and to do that i need other possibilities
1800045 i see you have at least started to think your situation out but harry you and miss weasley are already friends by that time and that is the start you need to build a successful marriage
1800046 professor you usually make it a habit not to interfere in the relations of your students correct
1800047 well yes i try to never interfere except where proprietys sake is involved
1800048 that leads to another problem ginny was already in a reasonably good relationship at that time i need more time also i was mourning sirius and it took me most of that summer to learn to trust ginny with my heart and by the time september first came i was ready to fall in love with her i think
1800049 but my hopes were dashed and now i have to work on learning to trust as two people not just one
1800050 i want the best possible chance that this will work and not end up with me in the permanent incapacitation ward at st mungos because that is what will happen if we use your time table sir
1800051 your argument has merit harry but i need to know the dates you asked for in order to help approve or veto the choices
1800052 only one date seems to work sir and that is three weeks before ginny was taken into the chamber of secrets i will need the week to rest and build up my strength hermione said that i will be magically exhausted for about a week after the arrival in that time
1800053 you wont be able to save them harry and your grief will be doubled for trying
1800054 i know you want to save those who have died but you will only be able to make small changes not big ones if you do otherwise then your memories of this timeline will be of little use to you
1800055 yes harry you will be changing the timeline as you go but the same actions should have very similar results if everything remains as close to the original timeline as possible i know you hope to save as many of them as you can but be careful you dont change too much or else all of this may be for nothing
1800056 you mean like making siriuss last two years comfortable for him instead of running for the whole time or being imprisoned in his own house to stay safe from the ministry
1800057 or perhaps orchestrating pettigrew being captured early in order to free him
1800058 i know i cant make major changes without major interruptions in my memories from this timeline but the small things can mean as much as the big things in the right conditions
1800059 i will consider this and let you know tomorrow morning
1800060 the other reason i am here is to let you know that the school is closing the recent attack has made it necessary to protect the students i have made special arrangements with the ministry to allow certain people to remain here to fulfil the task they have been entrusted with
1800061 the weasleys the order as they can be available miss granger and any other person you would like to have here
1800062 thank you sir can i give you a list of these people by tomorrow morning
1800063 yes harry that would be acceptable now it looks as if i should go your minders seem to think i have overstayed my welcome
1800064 albus may we speak in the hall for just a moment
1800065 certainly molly i have a few minutes to spare but i must ask that we make this quick i have some travel arrangements to make for the remaining students needing to return home
1800066 now rest well harry it seems that you have a hectic day tomorrow
1800067 dumbledore said he would ask the minister to bring the paperwork with him for his visit tomorrow
1800068 i have so many arrangements to make for this next month this has to be the best of your life

1800116 and he had blood all over his clothes and it was getting all over the floor he explained that he was in the park across the street and had seen a mountain lion and he apparently reached to pet it and that it scratched him we went ahead and rendered first aid we tried to stop the bleeding and we went in and called 911 to let the sheriff and medical personnel know so that we could bring assistance to him
1800117 if it happened the way the victim stated he should consider himself very lucky to walk away with minor injuries
1800118 if the mountain lion did scratch him it was a provoked incident and were probably not going to do anything
1800119 saya melihat islam di barat tetapi tidak melihat orang islam saya melihat orang islam di timur tetapi tidak melihat islam

1800123 umat beragama harus bisa menciptakan sesuatu yang intensif dalam hubungan antar umat umat kristen dapat menciptakan perayaan natal yang dapat dihadiri umat lain itu bisa dilakukan jika perayaan tersebut tidak mengandung ritual dalam kaitan ini moeslim mencontohkan tradisi mudik dan ketupat pada idul fitri yang dapat diikuti penganut agama manapun
1800124 dengan demikian pada natal nasional misalnya umat agama lain bisa datang tanpa merasa ada kesulitan ini berarti kita mempunyai tradisi atau event yang bisa dirayakan bersama
1800125 tafsir tafsir klasik al quran tidak lagi memberi makna dan fungsi yang jelas dalam kehidupan umat
1800126 dalam logika orang desa kalau ada satu kelompok yang merasa benar sendiri dan yang lain dituding salah atau sesat nanti saya kawatir kesepian di surga tidak ada temannya klaim klaim kebenaran absolut seperti itu sesungguhnya lebih menunjukkan barangkali dalam bahasa yang agak sarkastik kurang menyadari bahwa hidup sosial tidak bisa sendirian di hutan sajapun tidak bisa hidup sendirian mesti bersama hewan hewan pohon pohonan dan semak belukar
1800127 bangunan epistomologis teologis inklusif cak nur nurkholis madjid diawali dengan tafsiran al islam sebagai sikap pasrah kehadiran tuhan kepasrahan ini menjadi ciri pokok semua agama yang benar inilah word view al quran bahwa semua agama yang benar adalah al islam
1800128 sesuai firman tuhan ini terdapat jaminan teologis bagi umat beragama apa pun
1800129 kita tak akan panik meskipun orang berpindah pindah agama sehari tiga kali seperti minum obat
1800130 barat harus dimusuhi sebagai penjajah namun harus dikawani sebagai peradaban agama kristen yang dibawa para misionaris barat harus dimusuhi sejauh ketika agama tersebut dipakai sebagai kedok imperialisme namun sebagai sebuah agama k h a dahlan sangat menghormati para pemeluk agama kristen hal ini ditunjukkan dengan pergaulannya yang amat luas tidak sebatas sesama umat islam sejarah mencatat bahwa beliau sangat akrab dengan para pastur dan pendeta
1800131 pengabaian semangat berpikir ini tak ayal melahirkan kejumudan mayoritas kader dan aktivis muhammadiyah
1800132 figur mulia muhammad sekadar dipahami dalam prespektif gestural tekstualis seperti cara makan nabi memelihara jenggot tanpa menelisik lebih dalam makna perjuangan nabi secara lebih luas cara ber muhammadiyah seperti ini bahkan menodai cita awal muhammadiyah didirikan kh ahmad dahlan
1800133 bagi muhammadiyah lebih baik langsung berperilaku liberal demokratis dan pluralis daripada banyak bicara liberalisme demokrasi dan pluralisme tetapi sebaliknya berperilaku antiliberal antidemokrasi dan antipluralisme
1800134 tetapi pandangan semacam ini tampaknya belakangan mulai berubah lahirnya kesadaran untuk mengkaji islam secara lebih dekat dan munculnya pengkajian islam dengan pendekatan yang lebih akademis telah melahirkan pandangan yang cukup positif terhadap hal itu ditandai dengan lahirnya sejumlah karya sarjana sarjana kristen yang berusaha memotret al qur an dengan pandangan yang lebih objektif di antara karya yang bisa disebut adalah islamic revelation in the modern world karya w montgomery watt religion and revelation nya keith ward the event of the quran the mind of the quran muhammad and the christian readings in the quran dan returning to mount hira yang secara berturut turut ditulis pada tahun 1971 1972 1986 1988 dan 1994 oleh kenneth cragg seorang biarawan anglikan lahirnya karya karya ini bisa disebut sebagai gelombang baru hubungan islam kristen dalam konteks pengakuan di hadapan umat kristiani di luar kekurangan dan kelebihannya usaha usaha untuk mempersepsi al quran dengan cara yang lebih sophisticated semacam ini pada tataran yang lebih jauh justru akan menjadi jalan bagi upaya untuk menemukan common platform kitab suci agama agama dunia yang selama ini sering menjadi persoalan
1800135 banyak yang mengganggap dan mempercayai bahwa islam yang otentik dan paling benar adalah islam yang dipraktikkan oleh nabi muhammad semasa hidup
1800136 apakah ada orang lain termasuk di lingkungan muhammadiyah yang memahami dan mempraktikkan islam lebih baik dari apa yang dicontohkan oleh nabi muhammad saw bukankah kuam muslim pasti meyakini bahwa nabi saw adalah uswatun hasanah contoh yang baik
1800137 semua agama sama semuanya menuju jalan kebenaran jadi islam bukan yang paling benar
1800138 dengan tanpa rasa sungkan dan kikuk saya mengatakan semua agama adalah tepat berada pada jalan seperti itu jalan panjang menuju yang mahabenar semua agama dengan demikian adalah benar dengan variasi tingkat dan kadar kedalaman yang berbeda beda dalam menghayati jalan religiusitas itu semua agama ada dalam satu keluarga besar yang sama yaitu keluarga pencinta jalan menuju kebenaran yang tak pernah ada ujungnya
1800139 larangan kawin beda agama dalam hal ini antara perempuan islam dengan lelaki non islam sudah tidak relevan lagi
1800140 karenanya yang diperlukan sekarang ini dalam penghayatan masalah pluralisme antar agama yakni pandangan bahwa siapa pun yang beriman tanpa harus melihat agamanya apa adalah sama di hadapan allah karena tuhan kita semua adalah tuhan yang satu
1800141 jika semua agama memang benar sendiri penting diyakini bahwa surga tuhan yang satu itu sendiri terdiri banyak pintu dan kamar tiap pintu adalah jalan pemeluk tiap agama memasuki kamar surganya syarat memasuki surga ialah keikhlasan pembebasan manusia dari kelaparan penderitaan kekerasan dan ketakutan tanpa melihat agamanya inilah jalan universal surga bagi semua agama dari sini kerjasama dan dialog pemeluk berbeda agama jadi mungkin
1800142 agama agama lain adalah jalan yang sama sama sah untuk mencapai kebenaran yang sama
1800143 agama agama lain berbicara secara berbeda tetapi merupakan kebenaran kebenaran yang sama sah
1800144 sebagai sebuah pandangan keagamaan pada dasarnya islam bersifat inklusif dan merentangkan tafsirannya ke arah yang semakin pluralis
1800145 prinsip lain yang digariskan oleh al quran adalah pengakuan eksistensi orang orang yang berbuat baik dalam setiap komunitas beragama dan dengan begitu layak memperoleh pahala dari tuhan lagi lagi prinsip ini memperkokoh ide mengenai pluralisme keagamaan dan menolak eksklusivisme dalam pengartian lain eksklusivisme keagamaan tidak sesuai dengan semangat al quran sebab al quran tidak membeda bedakan antara satu komunitas agama dari lainnya
1800146 dan konsekuensinya ada banyak kebenaran many truths dalam tradisi dan agama agama nietzsche menegasikan adanya kebenaran tunggal dan justru bersikap afirmatif terhadap banyak kebenaran mahatma gandhi pun seirama dengan mendeklarasikan bahwa semua agama entah hinduisme buddhisme yahudi kristen islam zoroaster maupun lainnya adalah benar dan konsekuensinya kebenaran ada dan ditemukan pada semua agama agama agama itu diibaratkan dalam nalar pluralisme gandhi seperti pohon yang memiliki banyak cabang many tapi berasal dari satu akar the one akar yang satu itulah yang menjadi asal dan orientasi agama agama karena itu mari kita memproklamasikan kembali bahwa pluralisme agama sudah menjadi hukum tuhan sunnatull h yang tidak mungkin berubah dan karena itu mustahil pula kita melawan dan menghindari sebagai muslim kita tidak punya jalan lain kecuali bersikap positif dan optimistis dalam menerima pluralisme agama sebagai hukum tuhan
1800147 seorang fideis muslim misalnya bisa merasa dekat kepada allah tanpa melewati jalur shalat karena ia bisa melakukannya lewat meditasi atau ritus ritus lain yang biasa dilakukan dalam persemedian spiritual dengan demikian pengalaman keagamaan hampir sepenuhnya independen dari aturan aturan formal agama pada gilirannya perangkat dan konsep konsep agama seperti kitab suci nabi malaikat dan lain lain tak terlalu penting lagi karena yang lebih penting adalah bagaimana seseorang bisa menikmati spiritualitas dan mentransendenkan dirinya dalam lompatan iman yang tanpa batas itu
1800148 tapi ketika saya mengatakan agama saya benar saya tidak punya hak untuk mengatakan bahwa agama orang lain salah apalagi kemudian menyalah nyalahkan atau memaki maki
1800149 filosofi pendidikan islam yang hanya membenarkan agamanya sendiri tanpa mau menerima kebenaran agama lain mesti mendapat kritik untuk selanjutnya dilakukan reorientasi konsep iman kafir muslim nonmuslim dan baik benar truth claim yang sangat berpengaruh terhadap cara pandang islam terhadap agama lain mesti dibongkar agar umat islam tidak lagi menganggap agama lain sebagai agama yang salah dan tidak ada jalan keselamatan jika cara pandangnya bersifat eksklusif dan intoleran maka teologi yang diterima adalah teologi eksklusif dan intoleran yang pada gilirannya akan merusak harmonisasi agama agama dan sikap tidak menghargai kebenaran agama lain kegagalan dalam mengembangkan semangat toleransi dan pluralisme agama dalam pendidikan islam akan membangkitkan sayap radikal islam
1800150 pendidikan agama semata mata menekankan keselamatan individu dan kelompoknya sendiri menjadikan anak didik kurang begitu sensitif atau kurang begitu peka terhadap nasib penderitaan kesulitan yang dialami oleh sesama yang kebetulan memeluk agama lain
1800151 islam itu memang pluralis islam itu banyak dan tidak satu memang secara teks islam adalah satu tetapi ketika akal sudah mulai mencoba memahami itu belum lagi mengaktualisasikan maka kemudian pluralitas itu adalah suatu kenyataan dan tidak bisa dielakkan
1800152 penafsiran atas sebuah agama baca islam sendiri tidaklah tunggal dengan demikian upaya mempersamakan dan mempersatukan di bawah payung satu tafsir agama menjadi kontraproduktif dan pada gilirannya agama kemudian menjadi sangat relatif ketika dijelmakan dalam praktik kehidupan sosial sehari hari
1800153 maka pernahkah kamu perhatikan orang orang yang telah menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai tuhan mereka dan allah membiarkannya sesat berdasarkan ilmu nya allah mengetahui bahwa ia tidak dapat menerima petunjuk yang diberikan kepadanya dan allah telah menutup pendengaran dan hatinya dan meletakkan tutup atas penglihatannya
1800154 conviction enabled abraham to wade into the fire conviction is an intoxicant which makes men self sacrificing know you oh victims of modern civilization lack of conviction is worse than slavery
1800155 relativism has become a dominant element in twentieth century theology
1800156 studies in methodology in textual criticism on the new testatement
1800157 sudah tiba saatnya sekarang untuk melakukan kritik teks terhadap sebagaimana telah kita lakukan terhadap kitab suci yahudi yang berbahasa ibrani arami dan kitab suci kristen yang berbahasa yunani the time has surely come to subject the text of the kuran to the same criticism as that to which we subject the hebrew and aramaic of the jewish bible and the greek of the christian scriptures

1800159 al quran dipandang sakral secara substansi tapi tulisannya tidak sakral
1800160 uraian dalam paragraf paragraf berikut mencoba mengungkapkan secara ringkas proses pemantapan teks dan bacaan alquran sembari menegaskan bahwa proses tersebut masih meninggalkan sejumlah masalah mendasar baik dalam ortografi teks maupun pemilihan bacaannya yang kita warisi dalam mushaf tercetak dewasa ini karena itu tulisan ini juga akan menggagas bagaimana menyelesaikan itu lewat suatu upaya penyuntingan edisi kritis alquran
1800161 kasarnya ada sejarah yang hilang untuk menjelaskan beberapa ayat atau susunan ayat al quran dari surat al fatihah sampai surat al nas
1800162 dan diberi kata pengantar dua orang doktor dalam bidang studi islam dosen di pasca sarjana uin yogyakarta di dalam buku ini misalnya kita bisa menikmati hujatan terhadap al quran seperti kata kata berikut ini
1800163 setelah kita kembalikan wacana islam arab ke dalam dunianya dan melepaskan diri kita dari hegemoni budaya arab kini saatnya kita melakukan upaya pencarian pesan tuhan yang terperangkap dalam mushaf utsmani dengan suatu metode dan pendekatan baru yang lebih kreatif dan produktif tanpa menegasikan besarnya peran yang dimainkan mushaf utsmani dalam mentransformasikan pesan tuhan kita terlebih dulu menempatkan mushaf utsmani itu setara dengan teks teks lain dengan kata lain mushaf itu tidak sakral dan absolue melainkan profan dan fleksibel yang sakral dan absolut hanyalah pesan tuhan yang terdapat di dalamnya yang masih dalam proses pencarian karena itu kini kita diperkekenankan bermain main dengan mushaf tersebut tanpa ada beban sedikitpun beban sakralitas yang melingkupi perasaan dan pikiran kita
1800164 sebagian besar kaum muslim meyakini bahwa alquran dari halaman pertama hingga terakhir merupakan kata kata allah yang diturunkan kepada nabi muhammad secara verbatim baik kata katanya lafdhan maupun maknanya manan kaum muslim juga meyakini bahwa alquran yang mereka lihat dan baca hari ini adalah persis sama seperti yang ada pada masa nabi lebih dari seribu empat ratus tahun silam keyakinan semacam itu sesungguhnya lebih merupakan formulasi dan angan angan teologis al khayal al dini yang dibuat oleh para ulama sebagai bagian dari formalisasi doktrin doktrin islam hakikat dan sejarah penulisan alquran sendiri sesungguhnya penuh dengan berbagai nuansa yang delicate rumit dan tidak sunyi dari perdebatan pertentangan intrik tipu daya dan rekayasa
1800165 di sinilah saya ingin menyebut teks teks islam klasik merupakan
1800166 dalam studi kritik quran pertama kali yang perlu dilakukan adalah kritik historisitas quran bahwa quran kini sudah berupa teks yang ketika hadir bukan bebas nilai dan tanpa konteks justru konteks arab 14 abad silam telah mengkonstruk quran adalah muhammad saw seorang figur yang saleh dan berhasil mentransformasikan nalar kritisnya dalam berdialektika dengan realitas arab namun setelah muhammad wafat generasi pasca muhammad terlihat tidak kreatif jangankan meniru kritisisme dan kreativitas muhammad dalam memperjuangkan perubahan realitas zamannya generasi pasca muhammad tampak kerdil dan hanya mem bebek pada apa saja yang asalkan itu dikonstruk muhammad dari sekian banyak daftar ketidakkreatifan generasi pasca muhammad yang paling mencelakakan adalah pembukuan quran dengan dialek quraisy oleh khalifah usman ibn affan yang diikuti dengan klaim otoritas mushafnya sebagai mushaf terabsah dan membakar menghilangkan pengaruh mushaf mushaf milik sahabat lain imbas dari sikap usman yang tidak kreatif ini adalah terjadinya militerisme nalar islam untuk tunduk mensakralkan quran produk quraisy karenanya wajar jika muncul asumsi bahwa pembukuan quran hanya siasat bangsa quraisy melalui usman untuk mempertahankan hegemoninya atas masyarakat arab dan islam hegemoni itu tampak jelas terpusat pada ranah kekuasaan agama dan budaya dan hanya orang yang mensakralkan quranlah yang berhasil terperangkap siasat bangsa quraisy tersebut
1800167 al quran merupakan produk budaya arab muntaj tsaqafi sudah memiliki sejumlah murid yang kini mengajar di sejumlah perguruan tinggi islam di indonesia
1800168 bila didekati secara mendalam dapat ditemui bahwa gerakan pembaruan yang terjadi sejak tahun tujuh puluhan memiliki komitmen yang cukup kuat untuk melestarikan tradisi turats dalam satu bingkai analisis yang kritis dan sistematis pemikiran para tokohnya didasari kepedulian yang sangat kuat untuk melakukan formulasi metodologi yang konsisten dan universal terhadap penafsiran al quran suatu penafsiran yang rasional yang peka terhadap konteks kultural dan historis dari teks kitab suci dan konteks masyarakat modern yang memerlukan bimbingannya
1800169 cak nur berpegang kuat kepada islam tradisi hampir secara keseluruhan pada tingkat esoteris dan eksoteris dengan sangat bagus dan distingtif ia bukan sekedar berpijak pada aspek itu namun ia juga memberikan sejumlah pendekatan dan penafsiran baru terhadap tradisi islam itu maka hasilnya adalah apresiasi yang cukup mendalam terhadap syariah atau fiqih dengan cara melakukan kontekstualisasi fiqih dalam perkembangan zaman
1800170 dan patut kita camkan benar benar pendapat sayyid muhammad rasyid ridla sebagaimana dikutip abdul hamid hakim bahwa pengertian sebagai ahlul kitab tidak terbatas hanya kepada kaum yahudi dan kristen seperti tersebut dengan jelas dalam al quran serta kaum majusi pengikut zoroaster seperti tersebutkan dalam sebuah hadits tetapi juga mencakup agama agama lain yang mempunyai suatu bentuk kitab suci
1800171 soal pernikahan laki laki non muslim dengan wanita muslim merupakan wilayah ijtihadi dan terikat dengan konteks tertentu diantaranya konteks dakwah islam pada saat itu yang mana jumlah umat islam tidak sebesar saat ini sehingga pernikahan antar agama merupakan sesuatu yang terlarang karena kedudukannya sebagai hukum yang lahir atas proses ijtihad maka amat dimungkinkan bila dicetuskan pendapat baru bahwa wanita muslim boleh menikah dengan laki laki non muslim atau pernikahan beda agama secara lebih luas amat diperbolehkan apapun agama dan aliran kepercayaannya
1800172 jika kita memahami konteks waktu turunnya ayat itu qs 60 10 pen larangan ini sangat wajar mengingat kaum kafir quraisy sangat memusuhi nabi dan pengikutnya waktu itu konteksnya adalah peperangan antara kaum mukmin dan kaum kafir larangan melanggengkan hubungan dimaksudkan agar dapat diidentifikasi secara jelas mana musuh dan mana kawan karena itu ayat ini harus dipahami secara kontekstual jika kondisi peperangan itu tidak ada lagi maka larangan dimaksud tercabut dengan sendirinya
1800173 maka dari itu kita perlu meruntuhkan mitos fikih yang mendasari larangan bagi perempuan muslim untuk menikah dengan laki laki nonmuslim isu yang paling mendasar dari larangan pba perkawinan beda agama red adalah masalah sosial politik hanya saja ketika yang berkembang kemudian adalah logika agama maka konteks sosial politik munculnya larangan pba itu menjadi tenggelam oleh hegemoni cara berpikir teologis
1800174 larangan kawin beda agama dalam hal ini antara perempuan islam dengan lelaki non islam sudah tidak relevan lagi
1800175 pernikahan yang dikatakan sebagai pembirokrasian seks ini tak lain tak bukan adalah lembaga yang berisi tong tong sampah penampung sperma yang secara anarkis telah membelah belah manusia dengan klaim klaim yang sangat menyakitkan istilah pelacur dan anak haram pun muncul dari rezim ini perempuan yang melakukan seks di luar lembaga ini dengan sangat kejam diposisikan sebagai perempuan yang sangat hina tuna lacur dan tak pantas menyandang harga diri padahal apa bedanya pelacur dengan perempuan yang berstatus istri posisinya sama mereka adalah penikmat dan pelayan seks laki laki seks akan tetap bernama seks meski dilakukan dengan satu atau banyak orang tidak pernikahan adalah konsep aneh dan menurutku mengerikan untuk bisa kupercaya
1800176 bentuk riil gerakan yang harus dibangun adalah 1 mengorganisir kaum homoseksual untuk bersatu dan berjuang merebut hak haknya yang telah dirampas oleh negara 2 memberi pemahaman kepada masyarakat bahwa apa yang terjadi pada diri kaum homoseksual adalah sesuatu yang normal dan fithrah sehingga masyarakat tidak mengucilkannya bahkan sebaliknya masyarakat ikut terlibat mendukung setiap gerakan kaum homoseksual dalam menuntut hak haknya 3 melakukan kritik dan reaktualisasi tafsir keagamaan tafsir kisah luth dan konsep pernikahan yang tidak memihak kaum homoseksual 4 menyuarakan perubahan uu perkawinan no 1 1974 yang mendefinisikan perkawinan harus antara laki laki dan wanita
1800177 hanya orang primitif saja yang melihat perkawinan sejenis sebagai sesuatu yang abnormal dan berbahaya bagi kami tiada alasan kuat bagi siapapun dengan dalih apapun untuk melarang perkawinan sejenis sebab tuhan pun sudah maklum bahwa proyeknya menciptakan manusia sudah berhasil

1800180 berlainan halnya dengan al quran hadis tidak dikenal dicatat tidak dihafal di zaman nabi karena hadis tidak dihafal dan tidak dicatat dari sejak semula tidaklah dapat diketahui dengan pasti mana hadits yang betul betul berasal dari nabi dan mana hadits yang dibuat buat tidak ada kesepakatan kata antara umat islam tentang keorisinilan semua hadis dari nabi
1800181 uraian dr harun nasution yang terselubung uraian ilmiyah sesungguhnya mengandung bahaya bagi generasi muda islam yang ingin dipudarkan keimanannya
1800182 karena itu beliau perlu diteladani oleh para intelektual maupun generasi berikutnya
1800183 usaha dan kerja keras harun nasution dalam pengembangan islamic studies di indonesia patut dihargai harun seyogianya dianugerahi sebagai tokoh islamic studies di indonesia
1800184 yang merusak umatku adalah orang alim yang durhaka dan ahli ibadah yang bodoh seburuk buruk manusia yang buruk adalah ulama yang buruk dan sebaik baik manusia yang baik adalah ulama yang baik

1800329 a national research council nrc report on fluoride gives powerful evidence that many americans are being over dosed with harmful levels of fluoride
1800330 local and state medical societies and individual physicians have the opportunity to become involved in correcting the problem of fluoride underfeeding by 1 ascertaining whether municipal water supplies are optimally fluoridated and 2 working with public health agencies to take corrective action if suboptimal fluoridation is found

1800344 this is a crucial issue for archaeology because if chickens were in south america before the spanish arrived it means people must have brought them there across the breadth of the pacific ocean
1800345 we know there was at least some contact between pre european polynesians and americans because the south american sweet potato occurs in polynesia and the bottle gourd from asia and ultimately africa occurs in south america
1800346 however to date there has been no conclusive archaeological evidence for the presence of polynesians in south america making recent claims for presence of pre columbian chickens in south america a key issue
1800347 the study found no support for previous claims for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south america
1800348 this does not mean that polynesians and people in the americas did not have contact in the past just that the current archaeological evidence does not suggest that chickens were part of the package
1800349 regardless of recent crop price declines from record highs nutrient prices remain very strong and supply remains tight
1800350 given that global and u s grain inventories remain very tight grain prices will continue to reflect growing conditions and yield potential for both u s and global crop production

1800359 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1800360 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1800361 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1800362 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1800363 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1800364 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1800365 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies
1800366 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits

1800371 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
1800372 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
1800373 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
1800374 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada

1800403 continued subscriber losses and investments in customer service improvements are taking a toll on both top line and bottom line growth
1800404 sprint nextel currently expects to report higher post paid subscriber losses in the third quarter due to a seasonal uptick in churn when compared with second quarter 2008 results
1800405 we expect sequential declines in post paid gross adds to moderate and we expect modest pressure on post paid average revenue per user for the balance of 2008 this combination of factors is expected to result in a sequential reduction in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter capital spending for the wireless and wireline segments is expected to be comparable to first half levels of 1 3 billion and 261 million respectively also expects free cash flow to improve substantially in the second half of 2008 furthermore the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future and expects to reduce gross debt by at least 1 billion by the end of the third quarter
1800406 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability

1800409 if the billing process takes nearly 50 of the billed revenue you cant offer 99 cent music and bill it to the mobile phone
1800410 with the royalties and other costs the math just doesnt work out compare the cost of billing purchases to a credit card and its easy to see why mobile payments arent taking off
1800411 bands and artists are increasingly using mobile to form direct relationships with their fans that are then monetized through other means such as tickets to live shows merchandise and fan clubs
1800412 in addition given consumers reluctance to pay for music on their phones marketers are finding new opportunities to partner directly with carriers labels and even music artists themselves
1800413 i think content in general is something the service providers have struggled with because its new to them
1800414 telecom companies used to not offer any content then there were ringtones and for a lot of them their eyes just glazed over they thought were going to make millions and i think they kind of learned the hard way that its more complicated than that
1800415 the music business has really been struggling with the internet
1800416 their model was to take that one hit track squeeze so much revenue out of it bundle it with other tracks and repurpose it on a greatest hits album or a soundtrack

1800448 we are pleased with this earnings performance in this difficult gaming market environment
1800449 we had slightly improved earnings in the second quarter 2008 in spite of the 130 000 of other income in the second quarter 2007 primarily related to foreign currency exchange gains that did not recur in the second quarter 2008 this means on a comparative basis our earnings increased by around 140 000 on reduced sales the main contributing factors to this performance was the reduction in operating expenses of approximately 330 000 due to tight controls and the reduction in interest expense of approximately 90 000 due to lower inventory levels and interest rates the sales decline was caused by a reduction of 1 7 million in non core amusement sales partly offset by the 9 3 growth in gaming sales margins were maintained in the second quarter 2008 at 16 1 compared to 16 4 in the first quarter 2008
1800450 the balance sheet has been considerably strengthened with debt being reduced to 5 2 million as of june 30 2008 compared with 7 4 million at june 30 2007 and 9 9 million at june 30 2006 as a result the debt has been reduced almost 50 percent in the past two years the company has generated 1 6 million of operating cash flow in the first six months of 2008 being the main reason interest expenses has been reduced by almost 150 000 in the first half 2008
1800451 considering we earned more in the first six months 2008 than we did in twelve months 2007 we expect the net earnings for the full year 2008 to be better than that of last year despite reduced sales we currently expect that sales for the full year 2008 will be in the upper fifty million dollar range slightly less than last year as the worldwide gaming slot machine market remains sluggish for a longer period of time than many had anticipated we will continue to aggressively control costs interest expense and inventory levels ahead of the expected rebound in the slot machine replacement market

1800454 we are experiencing a marked slowdown in our sales driven by several factors impacting the golf equipment market
1800455 weak retail sales poor weather a lack of new product offerings by some of our customers and the overall weak economic conditions are several factors impacting the golf equipment market looking at industry reports 2008 equipment sales have been weak year to date and are forecasted to remain so through the remainder of the year through the first six months of 2008 the golf industry is experiencing a significant decline in sales of metal woods and iron sets our sales to several large customers in particular continued to be hurt by slowing sales of second selling season oem programs these customers have new shaft programs set to begin delivery late in the third quarter of 2008

1800457 our other high performance shaft models also continue to do very well on tour the combination of the aldila dvs vs proto and nv continue to be among the most popular shafts on the pga tour in woods and the most popular in hybrid clubs on the nationwide tour we remain the leading wood and hybrid shafts in play we are also proud to acknowledge aldila staff member paula creamer on her recent victory at the jamie farr owens corning classic on the lpga tour this was her third win this year playing aldila shafts she continues to be an outstanding player and spokesperson for aldila we are also continuing to see our success on tour translate to increased play by top amateur golfers as well aldila was the most popular wood and hybrid shaft at the ncaa division 1 mens championship and the leading driver shaft at the ncaa womens championship we were also the leading shaft in woods and hybrids at the recent u s amateur public links championship and the u s junior amateur championship

1800466 the good news is that breakthrough innovations such as the root zone in astroturfs gameday grass 3d represent a significant advancement in the evolution of synthetic turf making it much more realistic and forgiving than most of the standard artificial turf systems currently in use something that coaches athletic trainers and athletes should be very excited about

1800564 would you want your wife to stay home to care for the children

1800629 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
1800630 because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1800631 if democrats want to block what a majority of the house and senate want they can proceed with a strategy that would in effect shut down the government

1800676 given that masaevs accusation was directed at chechnyas leadership there are grounds to believe that his subsequent

1800760 the good news for boeing is that it is a genuine opportunity
1800761 at this point it is a fair bet that politicians are going to start meddling in the selection process
1800762 nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude
1800763 yo no soy jos mourinho por qu me comparan con l como entrenador soy un hombre que asume las responsabilidades pero mourinho es mourinho es de una cultura diferente a la m a
1800764 yo soy del sur de brasil y en mi cultura nunca diremos
1800765 ganar 10 campeonatos pero yo soy m s modesto que eso s lo dir que tratar de dar lo mejor para ganar todas las competiciones
1800766 en el pasado han gastado m s dinero pero ahora no necesitan invertir m s porque ya tienen una base s lida ahora necesitan un t cnico que descubra j venes jugadores y yo creo que soy ese estratega
1800767 lo que m s resalta es su orden para tener la pelota
1800768 es muy claro lo que quiere en la cancha lo que m s resalta es el orden para tener la pelota
1800769 me llevo muy buena imagen del entrenador y de su cuerpo t cnico son personas muy amables y atentas se empieza con el respeto para que esto funcione no son nada fr os son gente de futbol y saben lo que se siente en la cancha
1800770 es no arriesgar balones y estar en un bloque muy corto para recuperar el esf rico y cerrar espacios para que el equipo contrario no pueda triangular
1800771 muchas sorpresas no va a haber se ponen detalles a la defensiva y en la pr xima semana se va a trabajar a la ofensiva
1800772 en lo b sico creo que no hay mucho que hacer el parado t ctico va ser importante de c mo vamos a atacar a un equipo que va a ser estudiado por el cuerpo t cnico y sabr por donde hacerle da o a este rival y de entrada nosotros con el coraz n por delante y despu s la creatividad y calidad de cada uno

1800783 the bleeding edge browser is part of a new mozilla labs initiative in which the open source foundation is encouraging people to contribute ideas and designs for the browser of the future
1800784 the aurora browser demonstration shows a highly advanced way of collaborating data gathered on the web
1800785 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
1800786 menu labeling is a powerful education tool what we want to do is offer information so people can make the right choices
1800787 we understand that consumers want it and a lot of restaurants already provide this information said jot condie president and ceo of the organization which represents 22 000 outlets in the state
1800788 the national enquirer broke that story about jesse jackson and when the new york times finally decided to run it they put it on page 21 under a one column headline compare that to a story with two unnamed sources that think that maybe that im not sure but i think that john mccain was having an affair with a lobbyist that winds up on page one of the new york times
1800789 i had long aspired to work at cnn and began contract talks a month ago i have high regard for my friends at olbermann and regret that they are so angry about my departure
1800790 in the end youre only as good as your sources
1800791 my sources were good we just got information that became outdated before they could update my point of view is viewers of world news knew early that week we had been wrong to say bentonite
1800792 our sources were current and former government scientists who were all involved in analyzing the substance in the letter
1800793 no he was not if it was ivins i would report that in a second
1800794 their initial conclusion based on microscopic examination was a brown substance that initially was reported as bentonite we went back immediately after the white house told us it was not the case we were told after further chemical analysis it was determined it was a silica but not bentonite something they had never seen before but had a brownish color
1800795 from my point of view it gave national credibility to have on the record attribution and not some anonymous scientists
1800796 about a minute before we went on air the white house called and said it was not bentonite thats all they said
1800797 i spent the weekend going back to all the sources saying whats going on here guys
1800798 what they said was accurate at that point in their point of view
1800799 the people who say the white house lied to us to build a case on iraq or something doesnt hold
1800800 the local health officials tested the poultry and evidently they were positively attacked by the virus h5n1
1800801 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
1800802 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
1800803 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
1800804 the fact is that coal has doubled in cost in the last year alone dramatically affecting aep ohios costs
1800805 the tools given to us by the states new energy plan allow us to phase in those fuel price increases over time so that unlike the spikes ohioans see in so many products aep ohios rate increases are spread out to be made more affordable
1800806 were committed to staying in rochester we just need to find a place for our stuff in rochester
1800807 s quiz sea la ltima oportunidad espero aprovecharla y mantenerme porque cuando lo hice el torneo pasado me qued hasta jugar las finales de la libertadores
1800808 ya son varios torneos en los que me he sentido con muchas ganas de poner mi nombre en alto en la instituci n sin duda lo he demostrado en ciertos partidos a uno le gusta estar mostr ndose y si no es aqu puede ser en otro lado no descarto eso
1800809 ram n d az me coment que podr a jugar de lateral los partidos de preparaci n en estados unidos los jugu en esa posici n y estoy consciente que puedo hacerlo por ese lado
1800810 los goles que han recibido fueron por desatenciones nuestras estamos conscientes que tenemos que trabajar para que no se vuelvan a cometer los mismos errores
1800811 se puede decir que los vi cansados el equipo no puso las mismas ganas que en el partido contra santos no s si fue que estuvieran cansados lo que s puedo decir es que los goles que anot toluca fueron errores de nosotros
1800812 they could turn it into 2 gay guys in a bowl that way they can spoon
1800813 its harold and kumar go to white castle with guns and stuff
1800814 el contrato de ortega es por once meses y quedamos de acuerdo en mantener en reserva los detalles econ micos
1800815 creo que la situaci n que l va a vivir en mendoza es distinta a la que vive en buenos aires aqu no hay tantas tentaciones y adem s vendr con su familia
1800816 ortega va a colocar al independiente rivadavia en una situaci n especial frente al f tbol no creo que esto complique la tarea del entrenador roberto trotta
1800817 trotta est contento de contar con semejante jugador vamos a ayudarlo a resolver el problema que tiene resuelto esto es una buena persona humilde y simple
1800818 creo que hice lo que hab a que hacer lo dem s no me interesa
1800819 no hay otra manera de sacar adelante al equipo que con trabajo con mucha disposici n con orden paciencia y tranquilidad hay que recordar que en los ltimos minutos tambi n se ganan los partidos y tenemos que estar atentos
1800820 creo que tenemos que mejorar mucho tanto de visita como en casa frente a san luis tenemos que comenzar a mejorar mucho la afici n quiere ver a su equipo que proponga y ganador lo importante ser no perder
1800821 vengo de una lesi n complicada en la rodilla pero me siento bien a n con algunas precauciones si me toca entrar como titular estoy listo para ello al igual que si voy de cambio o si el t cnico decida que no juego tambi n confiamos en los que s lo har n
1800822 es un sue o hecho realidad para m y para los jugadores
1800823 ser un lindo espect culo ver al real madrid jugando con santa fe y uno se siente orgulloso de estar en ese espect culo de enfrentarlo de hacer las cosas de la mejor manera y de ir mejorando d a a d a
1800824 solo quiero que todos se desempe en igual para que el colectivo sea importante y as podamos sacar las cosas adelante
1800825 al real madrid hay que enfrentarlo con responsabilidad sabiendo que es un equipo muy grande y lo que representa para el f tbol mundial un equipo como esos
1800826 employees get to vote on how theyll vote either secret election or a check off card
1800827 currently the system is stacked against the workers in favor of the employers so this legislation makes it easier for workers to form unions
1800828 vengo de jugar varios a os con platense y ahora al f tbol de venezuela que cada vez es m s conocido tratar de evolucionar y crecer como persona para adaptarme a mis nuevos compa eros
1800829 la iniciativa para convertir al presente equipo en una organizaci n de alto impacto deportivo se ha evaluado de manera minuciosa
1800830 he decidido concentrar todas mis energ as en el relevo
1800831 desafortunadamente cuando uno ha ganado antes sabe que se necesita para ser el n mero uno y cuando uno no se siente a esa altura es mejor no competir
1800832 cada vez que este a o comenc a mejorar en mi preparaci n algo sucedi que afecto la misma y algunas veces hay que tomar una decisi n sabia quiero dedicarme al revelo para cumplir con otros tres compa eros que en cierto sentido dependen de mi por eso decid competir en el relevo para que australia presente el mejor equipo posible
1800833 no he tomado una decisi n si debo continuar en la presidencia del cmb y mi pregunta es mi ciclo ya se cerr porque no quiero gente en mi contra dentro del consejo
1800834 me quiero retirar como campe n y que el cmb decida mi continuidad en el cargo pero en mi mente estoy entero y tengo proyectos nuevos como el estar en contra del monopolio de la televisi n que respeten a los promotores por igual y que las promotoras desarrollen boxeadores como lo hace el consejo y no s lo tomen la crema de la leche
1800835 el peso m ximo de pacquiao es el ligero y para enfrentar a de la hoya ser a en superwelter y ser a una burla para los aficionados porque oscar no merece irse con la cola entre las patas despu s de su gran trayectoria
1800836 un sistema de comunicaciones telef nicas reservadas entre moggi y fabiani por una parte y los rbitros
1800837 the premise of this proposal to require a costly state imposed employee benefit that no other state now requires is unacceptable on its face
1800838 no employer shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee for opposing any practice made unlawful by this act including using paid sick leave taken pursuant to this act as a negative factor in an employment action such as hiring promotion or a disciplinary action
1800839 el equipo est optimista saldremos a buscar un gol que complique al am rica y nos d la clasificaci n
1800840 nosotros ten amos el compromiso de ganar el partido el jueves lamentablemente se nos escap esa oportunidad ahora iremos a colombia a buscar la clasificaci n lo importante ser no desesperarse y mantener la tranquilidad dentro de la cancha
1800841 todav a no hemos tra do el tipo de jugador de gran calidad que todos parecen esperar
1800842 seguimos investigando y mirando pero tengo que afirmar que no es tan f cil como pueden pensar y desde ya no estamos desesperados
1800843 bien podr a ser que comenz ramos el 2008 09 con la escuadra que tuvimos en la temporada anterior y despu s de todo no lo hicieron nada mal tenemos la combinaci n equilibrada de juventud y experiencia gracias al trabajo que hicimos en el mercado de pases el a o anterior
1800844 la decisi n ha sido tomada de manera conjunto y no tiene nada que ver con el estado f sico de ljungberg algo que el jugador ha demostrado durante la eurocopa
1800845 en t rminos generales la ruta es un reto para muchos atletas locales e internacionales ya que por la topograf a de la isla cuenta con subidas y bajadas que son un verdadero reto dentro una competencia de ciclismo
1800846 est todo definido de palabra se est haciendo la documentaci n correspondiente y a la tarde se firma todo salvo que alguna de las partes cambie de opini n est todo arreglado
1800847 fue la decisi n que m s me cost en mi carrera como entrenador por respeto a ariel no quiero entrar en detalles
1800848 estamos felices y orgullosos de que franck ribery por enorme mayor a haya sido seleccionado como el jugador del a o para el 2008
1800849 nunca pensamos que llegar an a pisar el estadio el camp n jugadores de la talla de ra l o de ruud van nistelrooy pero vea ma ana estar n aqu y podremos observarlos contra nuestro equipo es como un sue o
1800850 me toc de las m s baratas no hay para m s
1800851 desde que mi pap me llev al estadio a los ocho a os es decir hace 38 a os
1800852 esto no se ve todos los d as y ah est n los vecinos hinchas de millonarios el otro club de bogot muertos de la envida porque ellos se creen los hist ricos pero nosotros somos los que jugamos contra el madrid
1800853 son boletos costosos pero los grandes espect culos son as si usted va a ver a madonna pues sabe que la entrada est a la par con el espect culo
1800854 definitivamente el madrid como la selecci n brasil argentina o alemania es un sue o que no podemos perdernos y por eso estaremos alentando a nuestro santafecito en el estadio
1800855 siempre es molesta para un entrenador pero lo es especialmente para el jugador
1800856 puede quedarse sin los juegos ol mpicos teniendo una mala pretemporada y quedando en una mala relaci n con su club as que en estos casos nadie gana
1800857 sorprendido porque la decisi n se anunciara hoy cuando hace a os que sabemos que los jjoo son en china y son ahora
1800858 lo que no comprendo es por qu ocurre esto un d a antes del partido porque ha habido mucho tiempo antes
1800859 es menor de 23 a os as que deber a estar aqu los jugadores con menos de 23 a os tienen que estar disponibles para los jjoo
1800860 debe de ser una situaci n dif cil para el entrenador argentino en este momento
1800861 evidentemente cuando hay un gran futbolista que no juega contra nosotros es una buena cosa pero cuando te est s enfrentando a un equipo como argentina que est lleno de buenos jugadores como no los eliminen a todos
1800862 un equipo de gran valor que vienen a los juegos para intentar volver a ganar
1800863 cuando tienes delante un equipo muy fuerte intentas hacerlo mejor est s m s motivado
1800864 quiz s un equipo sorpresa que nadie se espera que tal vez se vista de naranja nunca se sabe
1800865 pr cticamente le estoy diciendo adi s a la selecci n
1800866 me parece que hay gente que puede hacerlo mejor en la selecci n gente nueva que aporte eso no significa que yo no pueda aportar porque los que llamaron tienen el mismo nivel m o
1800867 la selecci n es un camino que dejo de lado estoy muy contento por lo que hice dej huella con esa camiseta no lo puedo negar gracias a dios soy uno de los que m s anot en mundiales y eso es muy importante
1800868 uno sabe cuando puede ir y cuando no uno sabe cuando darle paso a otra gente
1800869 no known solution today offers the early results of this patent pending technology
1800870 estamos agora a proceder ao rescaldo o que temos fazer com muita cautela porque se trata de um edif cio muito antigo com estrutura de madeira o que obriga a deitar muita gua para garantir que n o h reacendimento

1800874 es ist nicht nachvollziehbar weshalb die pilotenvereinigung cockpit auf basis des vorliegenden angebots nicht verhandlungsbereit ist
1800875 i dont have enough money in my account so go ahead and kick me while i am down
1800876 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1800877 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1800878 this is really intended as a wake up call to show what could happen if nothing changes
1800879 non credevo che avrei assistito a uno spettacolo del genere mi si sono rizzati i capelli
1800880 anche la rai si accorta che la manifestazione ha il destino segnato
1800881 vogliamo raggiungere una soluzione condivisa replica borea che si trova fuori sanremo e dice di non avere ancora letto la lettera sui punti fondamentali siamo disponibili a un accordo
1800882 si trovi il modo di dare cibo a chi non ne ha
1800883 compromettono lo stato igienico sanitario di diverse strade che rimangono puntualmente dopo il passaggio dei rovistatori colme di spazzatura
1800884 apposita ordinanza comunale al fine di vietare in maniera tassativa il rovistaggio e recupero di rifiuti gi collocati allinterno dei cassonetti incaricando il corpo della polizia municipale e le forze dellordine al rispetto del succitato provvedimento
1800885 ci auguriamo ha detto il portavoce mario marazziti che contemporaneamente venga trovato il modo di offrire il necessario aiuto a chi ha come unica risorsa e parlo di anziani senza fissa dimora e di chi non arriva alla fine del mese quella di rovistare nei cassonetti
1800886 non la singola ordinanza che risolve il problema il rovistaggio peraltro un problema assai marginale
1800887 capisco la giusta preoccupazione per la tutela della salute e delligiene delle persone ma chi rovista nei cassonetti per mangiare deve avere opportunit per vivere
1800888 non pu essere interpretato da alcuni come un modo per affamare i poveri di roma perch questi sono quotidianamente al centro delle nostre attenzioni e dei nostri sforzi
1800889 to do drug tests we need to have cancer cells in cultures
1800890 we take the cancer cells add the targeted therapy drug agent and show whether it can kill or not kill
1800891 people have been trying very very hard to grow them in cultures and they would not grow
1800892 we decided to put them with some of the fluid they are found in the brain lo and behold they were able to grow
1800893 i say to you that we are in a battle and that more than half this battle is taking place in the battle field of the media and that we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of our nation
1800894 necessary for imperative reasons of security and the continued search for and securing of weapons that threaten iraqs security
1800895 engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists
1800896 the united states and forced repatriation of soviet citizens 1944 1947
1800897 wanted by fbi but walking out of a yemen hearing
1800898 declaration of principles for a long term relationship of cooperation and friendship between the republic of iraq and the united states of america
1800899 pero no alcanza hay que ofrecer m s plantear un partido muy vivaz muy explosivo de ida y vuelta
1800900 no es boca ni river argentino ni san lorenzo ni independiente ni palmeiras ni sao paulo
1800901 messi quiere quedarse con el equipo todo el campeonato no me voy a meter en temas legales pero s que va a seguir jugando para nosotros durante todo el campeonato pido a barcelona que comprenda su situaci n
1800902 sabemos bien lo que se juega el barcelona pero no creo que se sienta enojado por la decisi n que pueda tomar el jugador ni que pueda pasar a mayores
1800903 la clave estar en el dominio del bal n el equipo est optimista saldremos a buscar un gol que complique al am rica y nos brinde la clasificaci n
1800904 los jugadores de argentina y serbia tienen solo dos piernas dos brazos y una cabeza
1800905 lo bueno de estas situaciones es que generalmente no se espera nada especial de nosotros antes de cada partido
1800906 recuerdo muy bien aquellos partidos contra yugoslavia y argentina nadie daba nada por nosotros pero al final ganamos
1800907 brasil y nigeria tambi n estaban en nuestro grupo y todos dec an que los brasile os ganar an la medalla de oro y los yugoslavos la de plata y nosotros est bamos para hacer n mero y ese parece ser el escenario de hoy
1800908 pero todo ello puede servir como una mayor motivaci n para nuestros jugadores
1800909 las condiciones clim ticas nos favorecer n porque el equipo ha tenido una larga campa a de clasificaci n en asia y sabe lo que le esperara en china
1800910 ellos saben que cuando se enfrentan contra nosotros deben estar preparados para jugar 95 minutos nosotros nunca nos entregamos nos pueden hacer un gol pero nunca asumir que ya ganaron antes del minuto 90
1800911 no tengo dudas de que cuando deba competir la semana pr xima mirar hacia la derecha e izquierda y s que las otras competidoras no est n limpias de drogas
1800912 es una desgracia y he perdido la fe en el sistema porque hay muchos atletas que no son descubiertos
1800913 el problema que enfrenta tamsyn es su preocupaci n por competir contra atletas cuyo desempe o podr a ser asistido por drogas pero no es un nuevo problema
1800914 es algo que ha ocurrido por muchos a os no es algo nuevo en el deporte
1800915 si tamsyn tiene alguna evidencia especifica nos tendr a que informar y nosotros ciertamente se la enviaremos al comit ol mpico internacional coi
1800916 tamsyn no es reconocida por ocultar nada pero no s nada acerca de los temores de otros atletas de nuestra delegaci n
1800917 la mejor actitud que los atletas deben adoptar es ignorar todas las distracciones que puedan ocurrir o ver en los medios de prensa y centrarse totalmente en sus propios desempe os y dejar los problemas de detectar a los tramposos a las autoridades apropiadas
1800918 tamsyn es libre de expresar todo lo que desee pero si tiene que hacer alguna alegaci n especifica sobre alg n atleta nos la debe presentar a nosotros
1800919 yo tendr a la posibilidad de disputar de forma directa el cintur n ligero del cmb con el apoyo del se or sulaim n pero primero est la credibilidad y sostendr contiendas de preparaci n para ver mi estado f sico en estas peleas
1800920 ahora tengo m s madurez y estabilidad familiar y emocional que me permitir regresar al boxeo en buen nivel como es mi objetivo y no defraudar a los aficionados y promotores que me programen
1800921 estamos encantados de la decisi n un nime del jurado a favor de la atp tanto el jurado como el juez han reconocido y defendido nuestro derecho fundamental a establecer y realizar cambios en el calendario de la atp los cambios son necesarios para aprovechar todo el potencial de nuestro deporte
1800922 pr cticamente le estoy diciendo adi s a la selecci n
1800923 me parece que hay gente que puede hacerlo mejor en la selecci n gente nueva que aporte eso no significa que yo no pueda aportar porque los que llamaron tienen el mismo nivel m o
1800924 la selecci n es un camino que dejo de lado estoy muy contento por lo que hice dej huella con esa camiseta no lo puedo negar gracias a dios soy uno de los que m s anot en mundiales y eso es muy importante
1800925 uno sabe cuando puede ir y cuando no uno sabe cuando darle paso a otra gente

1800928 if our kids forget how to live with the land how will we survive education about ecology and food security is key
1800929 stos son los rivales que a veces sus r cords no dicen mucho pero que siempre dan buenos combates y vienen a pelear son de los que pelean con todo el mundo y le hacen una buena pelea a cualquiera
1800930 messi no hablar del asunto s lo quiere jugar saldr al campo este jueves y jugar ante costa de marfil
1800931 hay que considerar oficiales las palabras del seleccionador sergio batista y del presidente de la afa julio grondona
1800932 que consiguieron al paso por el ltimo premio de la monta a a los 228
1800933 nosotros enviamos al comit organizador un correo electr nico en el que explicamos la situaci n y se nombra al doctor balc zar como nuevo jefe de misi n por lo que hoy izaron la bandera paname a en la villa
1800934 me sorprend mucho y lo lamento porque hubiera sido mejor tener a esos magn ficos atletas de rivales
1800935 no estar kanaykin pero s el plusmarquista mundial ruso sergey morozov los espa oles francisco fern ndez y juan molina el ecuatoriano jefferson p rez y el tunecino hathem ghoula junto a otros de primer nivel
1800936 luego habr que ser muy inteligente rodar en el grupo con los punteros y guardar fuerzas para los kil metros finales que ser n muy dif ciles
1800937 lionel quiero que se junte con riquelme y que no sea s lo un definidor sino un jugador que genere f tbol
1800938 los cuatro tienen su posici n dentro del campo y tienen la libertad para jugar como ellos est n acostumbrados a hacerlo
1800939 esper bamos una decisi n en ese sentido amparada en los aspectos legales nosotros como la federaci n alemana de f tbol dfb defend amos que ni el reglamento de fifa ni la pr ctica imponen la obligatoriedad de ceder a los jugadores
1800940 la fifa actu con ligereza y se precipit al dar su veredicto lo que ha perjudicado la preparaci n de los clubes para la pr xima temporada
1800941 i lied to you and i cheated you and i cannot put into words how sorry i am
1800942 i dont know if there is enough room to keep all of this evidence
1800943 i believe in the innocence movement but youve got to have some common sense injected
1800944 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1800945 unable to give investigators an adequate explanation for his late night laboratory work
1800946 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1800947 it means that one of my friends has appendicitis in china i really feel for him
1800948 its a known risk i dont want to take anything away from j d he shot the better arrows that day there were four of us who had a chance and only three could make the team someone was going to be very disappointed and as it turned out it was me
1800949 im just going to take the best care of myself i can
1800950 i just have to keep myself properly hydrated on the planes
1800951 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1800952 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy

1800981 last night i met a minister and military intelligence officers separately and they all tell me that there will be bloodshed in the next few days
1800982 tomorrow saturday parliament will reconvene and the samak sundaravej government will push to rewrite the 2007 constitution tomorrow the pad will do what they have been doing every day but it will escalate its protest by increasing the number of protestors
1800983 these two protests which are not far from each other and the udon thani incident are making thais nervous that there will be bloodshed this weekend
1800984 there is highly confidential information that i am waiting to receive and in order for me to confidently predict whether there will be bloodshed or not i need that information
1800985 the group that is secure it has the militarys backing will bay for blood
1800986 it only takes a minor incident such as the burning of a car to stir up bloodshed
1800987 t his weekends clash will be larger than that in udon thani but it will not encourage a coup
1800988 ive been reading some of the comments on other blogs about this with a mounting sense of wonder at the sheer naivete of some users for anything that is important firstly always plan for redundancy in your systems have an online and on computer service that are synched secondly do frequent backups to a 3rd source thirdly if its important pay for it ad funded services are responsive to the advertisers not to the users its that pipers tune thing

1801008 we are very pleased to work with a company such as avis budget group which is extremely conscious of its environmental impact
1801009 together we will be able to make a positive impact on the future of the environment and set a standard for offsetting emissions for rental cars
1801010 at avis budget group we are very concerned with how our business affects the environment
1801011 teaming up with carbonfund org will help us advance our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our fleet
1801012 now ive just been walking around this area with a friend of mine who said this is like a circus theres everything here free condoms all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff
1801013 what is a respectable christian ministry doing in the middle of all this
1801014 i think this is just exactly where we should be its great to be in an environment where there are so many different views around but to be able to stand here with a christian perspective putting forward what the local church is doing pointing out that so much of the healthcare and support to people living with hiv through africa particularly is being provided by churches and christians
1801015 when i first started coming to these conferences you could count the number of christian ministries on one hand the church in some ways has been very slow coming into the table very judgmental what has been the turn around of this
1801016 i think its a realization of the heart of christ for marginalized people around the world and people living with hiv are often amongst the most marginalized tear fund started to take forward some innovative work with partners weve worked with trans gender communities in india weve worked with victims of sexual violence in the congo and were highlighting some of this work here but i think more than that this is a chance for the church to be changed in terms of our judgmental attitudes and in terms of the stigma that we address towards people with living with hiv and show that we actually do genuinely love everyone as the lord calls us to do
1801017 what would you say to the cynic saying well its as ive heard some people say its the gay plague its their own fault what would you say to that particularly in view of whats happening in africa
1801018 id say that each of us when we stand before god are people who need his forgiveness and grace and were not here asking how people contracted hiv but seeking to love them and look after them and support them where they are and as i say i think the church needs to change to reflect more the mind of christ and that god is using hiv to help us to do that
1801019 i was not a christian when i first entered college
1801020 the first week did not propel me in the right direction this happens way too often
1801021 ive run into lots of kids who said theyd come to christ through young life
1801022 this puts more earnestness in their own preparation and their own spiritual life while theyre still in high school
1801023 we also encourage the incoming students to prepare their facebook page in advance so that they will establish a christ honoring identity from the outset and include some creative expression of their faith
1801024 when someone knocks on your dorm room door that first thursday night and yells party make sure youve already connected with a ministry that has activities scheduled that night and all weekend your choice of friends that first night might seem insignificant at the time but its a first small step down one pathway or another later on when your christian friendships have been established you can figure out healthy ways to connect to the party crowd and share gods love
1801025 the best people to reach freshmen are the freshmen christians themselves
1801026 african childrens choir which well hear soon i think youll find them to be as angelic as i did
1801027 these are children who could have lost all hope but have overcome their circumstances and now are making a positive impact on society by being a voice for millions of children suffering in africa
1801028 it is with great sadness that we learned craig passed away in the early hours the teams thoughts are with craigs family and friends at this very difficult time craigs family passes on its thanks to all well wishers
1801029 he was one of our strongest personalities a unique person
1801030 through his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1801031 three decades after solzhenitsyns speech where do we find ourselves
1801032 thirty years ago this summer a 59 year old bearded dissident whose writings helped expose and eventually bring down soviet tyranny stood facing rows of robed faculty and graduates at harvards historic yard for its 327th commencement expectations ran high
1801033 solzhenitsyn delivered each line in his high pitched voice in russian
1801034 as it happened this summer i was reading a tattered copy of solzhenitsyns speech at the same time i was studying jeremiah in my devotions i was struck by the chilling parallels between the dissidents words and jeremiahs warning to the israelites
1801035 our concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
1801036 the master of this world who bears no evil within himself
1801037 our founders he reminded us would scarcely have countenanced all this freedom with no purpose but for the satisfaction of ones whims they demanded that freedom be granted conditionally upon the individuals constant exercise of his religious responsibility
1801038 solzhenitsyn could hardly have imagined that just 14 years later the u
1801039 fashionable trends of thoughts and ideas are fastidiously separated from those that are not fashionable
1801040 perhaps the hardest for the crowd to accept was his charge that the west had lost its civic courage particularly noticeable among the ruling and intellectual elites after all he said with unlimited freedom on the choice of pleasures why should one risk ones precious life in defense of the common good particularly when ones nation must be defended in distant lands he even predicted americans would care more about the rights of terrorists than their evil deeds a prophecy fulfilled by the supreme court in boumediene v bush granting terror suspects access to u s courts exactly 30 years to the week after solzhenitsyns speech
1801041 the condition solzhenitsyn diagnosed was identical to that of the ancient israelites
1801042 my summer study left me with a haunting question for the church is there still time to renew ourselves out of our spiritual exhaustion

1801053 fernando is a wonderful driver who would be a fantastic asset to any of the top teams including this one
1801054 the job ross and i have is to build a world championship winning team
1801055 of all the drivers right now he is the only one that i see as totally complete as michael schumacher was
1801056 firstly when the contract with fernando was terminated there were pre conditions which determined the behaviour of both parties post termination
1801057 we have no intention of breaching that agreement his opinion is his opinion im not going to voice my opinion about anything that fernando has done or said
1801058 what i would say is you cant see any strings leading to heikkis shoulders and hes an honest guy he will more than convince anyone who talks to him that this is a team absolutely committed to equality it always has been and it always will be
1801059 people will point to the last grand prix at hockenheim and say its absolutely obvious there were team orders in that event because it was clear that heikki moved over and let lewis past the essential fact was that throughout that race lewis was nearly seven tenths of a second faster than heikki and he knew that he was told that he was not told to let lewis past

1801063 as is often said journalists are entitled to their opinions but not their own facts the general coverage of this story has been appalling it has been fed by legitimate issues that some brits have with the united states but its now being used to feed anti american sentiment im more than happy to take my country to task for its failings including when it abuses the special relationship with britain i can understand british journalists who are sceptical of the american government but the coverage of this story is factually inaccurate and antagonistic
1801064 dimetr ah fuck it just call him jimmy yeah jimmy uh wheres he from alright good enough
1801065 zo versaagt niet en roept niet op tot de vrede daar gijlieden toch de overhand hebt en allah met u is
1801066 i am very happy today i started badly in the early laps but my bike had a really good set up so i could keep lapping in 1m26s laps then i pushed and pushed and finally i got the win
1801067 i was feeling quite comfortable for most of the race and everything was working quite well but i havent actually spent much time racing with kiyonari and wasnt sure how it was going to pan out he was very strong on the first split and when he came past i would have been very happy for second but when he did i realized he was in the same trouble as me then i saw max coming so fast and had to push really hard and it became a bit of a dogfight towards the end
1801068 im quite satisfied with the result i started good then went backwards as some other riders came through the first laps were very hard then i got into a good rhythm and overtook one by one at the end i couldnt believe i came close to these two guys but there was not enough time to try and take troy or kiyonari but it was a good race
1801069 im very happy with this weekend on friday i was in first position in qualifying then yesterday i set a good time in superpole it was the same today with fast lap times and a double win i had a lot of pressure with nori behind me and many times i made a mistake but to win here at brands hatch was fantastic today
1801070 im very happy for this result because in the first race the rear tyre was not so good and i was very disappointed in the second race i just changed it and this tyre gave quite a good feeling i make a battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places and finally i was not able to catch him but we made a really good race congratulations for kiyo
1801071 it was better than the first race when we had a few tyre troubles but we made some changes to the bike which definitely improved it but there was no way i could run the pace of the guys at the front they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took me a few laps to get past him but im content with third itll do for now but im looking forward to winning races again

1801090 i could read music before i could read and i was absolutely certain that i was going to end up playing at carnegie hall
1801091 after listening to some of the 11 and 12 year olds play who could play from sight everything it had taken me all year to learn i thought you know youre going to end up playing at nordstrom or a piano bar but not carnegie hall
1801092 so when its one of the four majors its thought of as being really important
1801093 theres a lot of empty seats usually when woods is in the event that doesnt happen
1801094 it was said best i think during the british open telecast
1801095 the guy is the best player in the game he does win a lot but he doesnt win them all
1801096 why should everybody else be downplayed or why should everybody else be lowered because hes not here
1801097 to me its just another golf tournament it dont matter if its augusta or what it is you gotta tee it up you gotta play golf and you gotta play well
1801098 there are four majors and every one is just as good as the other
1801099 kids andinia com nationmaster bob dinopets blog online dinosaurs laelaps the worldstart yahoo
1801100 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1801101 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1801102 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1801103 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1801104 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1801105 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1801106 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1801107 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1801108 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1801109 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1801110 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition
1801111 im going to stay in face stick to my game plan and at the end of the night my hand will be raised
1801112 gsp is foolish to consider me just a wrestler i hope he thinks im just a wrestler
1801113 all ive ever wanted was to fight the best guys
1801114 go i 95 north until you reach exit 141 then go east to wilmington
1801115 when the economy is bad it tends to favor the party thats out of power but the election is far from settled in fact mccain may benefit because of rising inflation
1801116 the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki was a criminal act on an epic scale
1801117 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1801118 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1801119 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1801120 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1801121 in the immediate aftermath of the bomb the allied occupation authorities banned all mention of radiation poisoning and insisted that people had been killed or injured only by the bombs blast
1801122 now if only theyd improve the chatbox itd be full tilt i guess with a better bet slider
1801123 we stand to greatly improve our models of fluid circulation and heat and mass transfer
1801124 temperatures are so high much of drilling equipment would melt and joins would not work anymore
1801125 the high temperature of the venting is especially interesting as this mid ocean ridge does not spread very rapidly
1801126 so one can presume that this portion of the south mid atlantic ridge is in a very magmatic phase and has been for a few years
1801127 the explanation could be that theres lot of magma but after a few more years of high temperatures its going to get to the point where it will be embarrassing how much magma there needs to be to maintain them for that long
1801128 if that turns out to be the case then we will have taken down some very very holy grails
1801129 no problem ill just visit the other walmart near where i live after work easy
1801130 we have been pretty busy planning our release that we hope at least some journalists will like we hope everyone would like it journalist or not but we understand that there are many haters out there so it s out of our control
1801131 every school year at hundreds of high schools across pennsylvania and new jersey students are asked and sometimes required to take a vocational aptitude test with a strange sounding name the asvab which stands for armed services vocational aptitude battery since vietnam the test has been a powerful peacetime recruiting tool for the pentagon hundreds of thousands of student scores have routinely been sent to the military each year typically leading to follow up calls from recruiters
1801132 this is as tough of a setup as ive ever seen
1801133 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough u s tour event
1801134 its nearly more u s open type that the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense
1801135 its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
1801136 it doesnt seem long because youve just come from birkdale
1801137 but its four inches and thick enough if youre more than 100 yards youre not going to get to the green from too many lies
1801138 so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
1801139 but i can see it going the other way too
1801140 usually of the four majors if you played your best you could score here now you could play great and 70 might be awesome
1801141 you look at guys who have not won majors who at my age 38 or even past my age who are playing well this year
1801142 this is another one of the guys who is a big piece of what were building here its going to be great to see him get the experience and get it started right here
1801143 ive got to put it behind myself its going to be difficult sleeping tonight no doubt but when i wake up in the morning its over and thats how im going to approach it
1801144 the whole game i couldnt locate my fastball at all
1801145 its tough to pitch if you cant locate your fastball
1801146 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers
1801147 he is one of his major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully
1801148 fortunately weve avoided major surgery and expect him back in training in the next six to eight weeks
1801149 you never know the full story until you go into the knee thats why weve been open in terms of the prognosis
1801150 i know the club had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much much better
1801151 ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past i know hes the no 1 but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful
1801152 its super exciting just walking around the village and seeing the rainbow of nations with every countrys colours and the different shapes and sizes of the athletes
1801153 its just really really cool it just kind of brings that olympic spirit to a head
1801154 its the first time where we actually meet all of us most of us have been here for two three four five days but its the first time that we gathered were here for the flag raising so it was very special and you could feel that the whole team is happy to be here the village is incredible so were ready to compete now
1801155 i won exactly on the sixth of august 1984 so to see the canadian flag go up like this and now in the position of chef de mission it was very special for me

1801235 n s iremos descobrir o quanto relevante ela eu tenho grandes esperan as de que este filme venha a inspirar toda uma nova gera o de telespectadores e revigorar os velhos f s eu acho que a relev ncia sempre tem a haver com personagens interessantes e boas hist rias al m de uma positiva vis o da humanidade e esperan a no futuro n s temos o filme wall e que um filme maravilhoso o qual nos leva a um excessivo consumismo e uma neglig ncia ao planeta dando num terr vel resultado mas mesmo assim neste filme existe um raio de esperan a ent o existe esse ramo de planta encontrado e que informa as pessoas que algo pode ser feito acho que jornada sempre teve essa mensagem de que alguma coisa pode ser feita ela tem sido sempre um ve culo onde resolvemos os problemas acredito que a audi ncia vai gostar disso e acho que isso sempre foi relevante a id ia de um grupo de pessoas muito dedicadas muito profissionais e intimamente ligadas que come am a resolver problemas ser sempre relevante
1801236 eu acho que um filme inteiramente diferente mais uma hist ria de aventura do que um coment rio social eu diria que se existe uma maior dire o emocional que determina no filme tem a haver com o conceito de vingan a e o dano que o desejo de vingan a pode causar e eu tenho sido sempre interessado nisso como uma preocupa o eu acho que n s temos visto em nosso tempo v rias fac es pol ticas v rios l deres pol ticos que querem se vingar pelo que eles sentem ter sido atacados injustamente e o ciclo vai se repetindo se repetindo e n o para algu m tem de dizer vamos parar com isso porque estamos destruindo um ao outro ent o eu acho que de fato sigo o filme com este conceito
1801237 eu estava preocupado em entrar num personagem em que estive fora por 18 anos eu estava preocupado no que poderia encontrar como identificador o que poderia achar como ponto de entrada do personagem acredito que essas preocupa es foram embora quando entrei no cen rio e comecei a trabalhar com j j abrams e meus colegas atores esse sempre tem sido o ponto de contato como trabalhar com o diretor e colegas atores e o script claro se nos forem dadas oportunidades de estabelecer isso de certo modo com o cen rio diretores c meras e assim sucessivamente com os atores e estabelecer com xito seus relacionamentos um com o outro encontrar seus momentos dram ticos e c micos na cena ent o tudo problemas desaparece gradualmente e acho que foi certamente o caso deste filme eu tive um maravilhoso divertimento e me senti totalmente seguro nas m os do diretor e do script e trabalhei com alguns timos atores eu realmente fiquei extremamente satisfeito creio que a audi ncia ir descobrir esses atores maravilhosos e ir gostar muito deles
1801238 todos os diretores anteriores trouxeram alguma coisa que foi valiosa para seus projetos mas nenhum deles teve o tamanho e a dimens o de produ o oferecida para lidar com esse filme
1801239 sim mesmo robert wise o primeiro filme em compara o foi menos complicado para filmar era de tamanho consider vel e havia extensas imagens mas n o era t o complexo em suas imagens e em sua hist ria como esse creio que essa a maior diferen a a prop sito esse filme de robert wise teve muito pouca oportunidade para qualquer significante intera o entre os personagens o script foi feito de tal modo que n o era sobre os personagens era sobre o conceito e a nave e neste caso n o acho que tivemos muita oportunidade como atores para trazer em cena os personagens que a audi ncia achou t o agrad veis na s rie de tv no filme de j j abrams exatamente o oposto todos os relacionamentos entre os personagens est o funcionando o humor que ficou terrivelmente desprovido no primeiro filme est presente constantemente nesse o senso de divers o e aventura al m da dimens o e do n vel de produ o que s o gigantescos em compara o acredite em mim eu j estive envolvido em filmes e televis o por 57 anos e nunca estive envolvido numa produ o desta escala e tamanho n o sei se jornada nas estrelas iv a volta para casa ainda mant m o record de bilheteria dos filmes da franquia mas o novo filme ir obviamente passar esse record
1801240 diferente n o porque eu me senti muito em casa bill estava trabalhando com um elenco de personagens que eram totalmente estranhos a ele eu j tive uma experi ncia muito diferente nesse novo filme interpretei frente a frente com os personagens que embora estivessem sendo conduzidos por novos atores eu os conhecia ent o me senti muito em casa
1801241 bem eu n o dirigi kirstie alley ela foi dirigida por nicholas meyer mas eu dirigi robin curtis o molde para o personagem delas j estava pronto n s preparamos um novo terreno com a cena do pon farr e alguns outros elementos mas esses eram elementos que eu j estava familiarizado tudo o que eu posso dizer que zachary quinto assistiu bastante o meu trabalho como spock e n s levamos muito tempo conversando sobre os ingredientes essenciais do personagem de modo que ele foi capaz de voar com ele creio que ele ter um maravilhoso sucesso ele tamb m um ator extremamente inteligente e talentoso e voc pode ir muito longe com essas qualidades

1801253 we can all mix and match where we can play and i think the formation was a good one

1801367 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1801368 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1801369 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1801370 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1801371 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1801372 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1801373 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1801374 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1801375 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1801376 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1801377 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition
1801378 i have been using the individual lashes for so many years i cannot remember
1801379 i have been using duralash naturals med length black indiviual lashes for about 10 years i love the product and purchase about 5 packs a month now that you have changed the packging to black lashes on silver grey background i found the product almost impossable to use i am destroying more lashes than i am using you might want to reconsider going back to black lashes on a pink tray this is much easier to see and use
1801380 im disappointed with sen roberts failure to vote for this bill and demonstrate his support for our troops
1801381 after 40 years in sen roberts misplaced priorities amaze me
1801382 at a time when we are asking so much of our troops they deserve a well earned increase in pay
1801383 we must ensure that the men and women who serve our country and their families receive the health care they need
1801384 mythical origin is a variant of the bibi shahbanu legend namely that at the time of the arab invasion a daughter or son or member of the court of yazdegird iii fled before an arab army towards khorassan came to a point of exhaustion near yazd called upon god and was taken into the mountain rock well or cave before the bewildered arab eyes the second part of the legend concerns a process of rediscovery that is to say the location of these sites of ascension to the next world was lost then in relatively recent times they were rediscovered by a shepherd child or other person in need to whom a spirit or saint pir appeared in a vision or a dream this spirit aids the human protagonist by solving the mystery of lost sheep lost path and so on requesting in return that a shrine be built

1801401 news of our first international airport with its world class design is already sparking new investments
1801402 there exists huge demand for meeting and convention space in northeast asia
1801403 the convention center will be marketed globally as a destination for not only u s and european conventions but also marketed to businesses in all of asia many meetings are already scheduled for 2008 and 2009
1801404 songdo ibds unique location is a big part of what is driving demand
1801405 its located at the epicenter of northeast asias booming economic region which contains 60 mega cities those with over a million inhabitants and the citys designation as a free economic zone with multinational financial incentives and english as its primary language makes songdo ibd a place where the international corporate community can work live and recreate
1801406 nothing of this type has been constructed for more than 10 years in this area
1801407 we are doing it in three or four separate phases with the first phase already under construction it will have 242 000 square feet of industrial which is still in strong demand there will also be 175 000 square feet of office so the first phase is not all that large relative to the size of the market
1801408 in terms of the business community in long beach theyve never been offered the opportunity to purchase an office building of this size three of the nine buildings are in escrow prior to construction
1801409 we have purchased 60 acres from boeing they continue to own the balance although we have some options for the balance of the space we love the location for obvious reasons it is adjacent to the airport and within a stones throw to the 405 corridor which is of vital importance for most people in the area it isnt in downtown long beach so it doesnt suffer that congestion this is a brand new business community it is probably not the best macro economic time but there is still demand

1801436 this is the iranians saying we can match you if it comes to that
1801437 they are some way away yet from threatening israel or us bases
1801438 a few missiles dropping is neither here nor there in the calculus
1801439 i dont think it is really going to impress israel that much as long as they iranians use conventional warheads

1801446 we are also sending a message to iran that we will defend american interests and the interests of our allies
1801447 we also are able to look to the future of a missile defence system that will make it more difficult for iran to threaten and and be bellicose and say terrible things because their missiles wont work
1801448 the manoeuvre brings power to the islamic republic of iran and is a lesson for enemies
1801449 this is our message we will proceed with development with or without them
1801450 i dont remember there being any issue about israel getting nukes why no problem for them and not iran

1801467 hyves is een netwerk voor vrienden door vrienden de requests die ze elkaar sturen nemen echt niet af door een apie of twee
1801468 waarom zou ik mijn eigen foto niet op mijn site mogen plaatsen
1801469 i like being clean shaven but sometimes the travel we do doesnt allow for that
1801470 ive had different approaches over different periods of my life i have had beards and the one thing i wont do if im growing a beard is i wont trim it because i feel like growing a beard is just to get away from shaving so if youre trimming that sort of defeats the purpose
1801471 well i took voice coaching which is maybe a little different than singing lessons
1801472 the producer of the record johnny miller wanted me to take some voice coaching in order to keep my voice a little longer
1801473 we tend to make music that we would like to hear
1801474 its about making music that youd like to be in the audience hearing
1801475 well theres that and its an important part youre certainly communing with the audience but theres also a new world order our ticket sales are a pretty significant percentage to say the least of our income i think were going towards a more live music world as far as just making a living through music the bands that are gonna be best live are gonna be the best off thats an important thing
1801476 its important to have some of those songs that make you want to get drunk and sing along and then you should also probably have some that are more reflective i mean it would be both untrue and irresponsible to portray drinking as a completely up thing because you always have to deal with a hangover the next day
1801477 ive always been kind of fascinated by how people use drugs and alcohol to kind of escape and to enhance and whatnot their normal daily lives
1801478 i think i do always try to be careful to write about the hangovers as much as i do the high
1801479 often times its other things that people use to get themselves someplace be it religion or whatever im sure we all know people who are obsessed with things that arent drugs or alcohol people who clean their houses obsessively or things like to the point where its unhealthy its all sort of interesting to me i think we all have our own things
1801480 i mean certainly drinking beer sports record collecting all that stuff i think when youre watching 85 baseball games a year i think theres some people in your life probably a girlfriend that think thats a little obsessive
1801481 basically the set up of our band is intended to be hopefully me a vivid storyteller backed by a great certainly traditional classic rock n roll band
1801482 i dont think its unfair but im not frustrated by it in any way its really hard to say though were on our fourth record and hes on the 30th year of his career so its hard for me to really think that theres an accurate comparison given that his career has lasted so long i mean there was a time when he was being compared constantly to dylan and hes outlasted that i think the piano is also a big thing where the piano sits in our music the e street band put piano in rock n roll in a way that was done better than almost anyone ever
1801483 hes brought it out for a few acoustic shows weve done and we finally got it on a record he can play a ton of different instruments but its pretty fun to see him play that
1801484 he had a harpsichord patch on his keyboard so he could make the sound but he was like it would be really cool to get a real one on there so he took a couple of microphones and a laptop up to some college upstate where franz had an in they had a harpsichord and they kind of snuck in played the song a few times brought it back and dumped on it was really cool
1801485 i was thinking that it was a song about tonys and then i started thinking about that movie and cutters
1801486 at the end of the day all that matters is the result
1801487 at the end of the day this brochure must be edited and at the printer by noon
1801488 it is what it is because i didnt have the time or resources to make it better or more sparkly
1801489 a rich greedy egotistical individual motivated only by money and the desire to accumulate more and more of it at the expense of the environment the working poor
1801490 the rights of the governed exceed the power of the government
1801491 we are excited about the potential of every one of the players in this recruiting class
1801492 each player will have a specific role to play early in his career at temple
1801493 foster is a talented athlete who will be a primary infielder with the potential to help out of the bullpen
1801494 unfortunately he had to endure a tough injury in his senior season we think fosters best baseball is ahead of him
1801495 i have worked with matt in camps for a few years
1801496 he is a hard nosed baseball player who will be an asset to our program
1801497 like most of the junior college players we have brought to temple we expect tony to impact the a 10 right away
1801498 he is a smooth fielding middle infielder who can hit in the early part of our lineup
1801499 tyler has the potential to be a front line pitcher on our staff
1801500 he is a multi sport athlete who comes to us with a great arm and lots of potential
1801501 drew is a very polished competitor from a great high school program who knows how to win
1801502 we think he can pitch quality innings early in his career
1801503 oh honey youve got nothing to worry about some guys really love big girls they love that in the bedroom

1801509 one cant fully appreciate what he has accomplished in acting writing directing producing and starring in a film like tropic thunder without recognizing that any single one of these functions alone is a full time job
1801510 to make a long story short i read it i loved it and we started working on it
1801511 all of this raises the issue that polite israeli society insists on sweeping under the rug israels repeated willingness to release terrorists for live and dead hostages makes clear the need to implement the death penalty against terrorist murderers the criminal code permits the death penalty to be used in cases of treason murder crimes against humanity genocide and crimes against the jewish people the problem is not the laws on the books the problem is the state prosecutions refusal to use them regardless of the nature of their crimes the state attorneys office refuses to request that judges sentence terrorists to death
1801512 county council needs a strong civic leader like bill dunn
1801513 ive known bill for a long time and i am confident that he will make a great county council president
1801514 bill dunn has been a strong community leader for a long time and i believe the county needs a man like him
1801515 when i have leaders with such distinction supporting my first campaign for public office i am humbled by his faith in me
1801516 i know i can restore confidence in the office and bring democracy back to county government
1801517 bill dunn is that rare kind of person who will work tirelessly to help the community
1801518 state law says we are to protect the rights of homeowners and make sure property is safe for the use planned it says that roads are to be improved to accommodate new traffic from a development the land use department is not paying attention to that mandate and council needs to assert its oversight role to protect current residents my goal is to make our residents the most important consideration in any council decision
1801519 we want to continue to recognize the right to develop land and renew older areas because it produces jobs and new housing but if we must develop we must do it right you cannot undo bad land use decisions once the construction has been finished
1801520 our analysis shows that the placing of a radio locating station in the czech republic and anti missile equipment in poland is a real threat to us
1801521 we believe that building infrastructure of the anti missile shield in poland and the czech republic will significantly boost the defences of a united europe
1801522 i want to stress that the anti missile system is not aimed at russia
1801523 my judgment is that the primary purposes of that site would be to counter intermediate to long range missiles primarily out of the middle east region
1801524 its very doubtful that elements of the national us missile defence system in eastern europe were aimed at iranian missiles as has been stated
1801525 i read it as having little or no technical merit
1801526 police and other security forces want to know where people are inside a building before they have to force an entry
1801527 protect its space capabilities respond to interference and deny if necessary adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to us national interests

1801529 almost exactly to the date of the change in sales practices we saw virtually no more of these junk guns being recovered from criminals
1801530 just looking at the rocks will tell us something about the history of this site
1801531 about a thousand feet from the surface it fires the darts downward like a giant shotgun cartridge
1801532 they will go through ten to twelve feet of water and still be effective
1801533 we also retrieved test rounds from two feet of sand
1801534 for underground destruction theres always the question of whether youve been successful or not
1801535 with the dart method it may be difficult to say whether the explosive has been safely burned away or whether the mine is still dangerous
1801536 more shock waves and more efficient compression of the flow with lower losses
1801537 please put down your weapon you have 20 seconds to comply
1801538 they will appear when they appear i cant talk about when that may be
1801539 we are not going to get into any arms race in space
1801540 the united states believes chinas development and testing of such weapons is inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation that both countries aspire to in the civil space area
1801541 from the view of the peaceful use of space and international security we naturally have concerns about it
1801542 our concern about this is that to have a capacity to shoot down satellites in outer space is not consistent with the traditional chinese position of opposition to the militarisation of outer space
1801543 based on the former soviet model it takes three to four years to engineer a drug resistant or more virulent pathogen
1801544 it takes 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine and have it approved
1801545 it is myopic to focus on the designated threat organisms
1801546 especially when the bigger threat is probably from natural disease
1801547 if something works for flu and for bioweapons as well why not do that
1801548 this is the sort of market failure that governments are supposed to step in and remedy if it is in the public interest
1801549 the dods recent shift to broad spectrum post exposure therapeutics will set the tone for changes in bioshield or perhaps new legislation
1801550 only seven states and four cities have the capability to administer stockpiled vaccines on a large scale
1801551 i can assure you the valley of death is real and it is long and treacherous
1801552 if were not willing to use it here against our fellow citizens then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation
1801553 i think that you would see a strongly negative public reaction and quite possibly an increase in violence if us police were to use the ads in riot control
1801554 oh my god people can carry cans of what appears to be soda and blow up a plane
1801555 its not the case that we absolutely cannot identify liquid explosives
1801556 when a plot is imminent its better to take the extra safety measure
1801557 it really doesnt make a difference whether the explosive is a solid or a liquid
1801558 analysts are trained to look for suspicious combinations of things
1801559 a solid explosive by its nature does not have a defined form and can take a variety of shapes and sizes with liquids at least you know you are looking for a container
1801560 a worldwide speed of light capability to the war fighter
1801561 shows that a relay mirror system can receive laser energy and redirect it to a target extending the lasers range
1801562 relay mirrors just add another set of systems requiring steady aim and split second coordination
1801563 even now forty years on from winning the world cup the media attitude towards the english soccer team is that they are still a major world force and genuine contenders for a major championship when quite evidently they are not however in the run up to the rugby world cup it was only rob andrew that was saying that england would get this far
1801564 rugby is love philosophy heart and soul and this people have got them all
1801565 will not be held to ransom by contracts or anything else
1801566 i think we must sit down in the cold light of day and once the dust has settled actually do a professional review of the team logistics medical fitness players and coaching staff and the administration we will make an assessment then

1801590 after more than 50 years empirical researchers of alphabetic languages have reached agreement about what is required to teach children to read the most reliable approach begins with teaching students about how the written word is simply a visual code for the spoken word it is often called phonics teaching and a childs understanding of how the code works is considered a necessary though not sufficient condition for skilled reading to develop
1801591 what is morale and is it relevant to educators who dont just claim but really do care about their students its nothing more than an infantile and sentimental notion the only folks who think it counts for anything are the defenders of business as usual who stand in the way of needed reform morale is an apparition that is expediently used by teachers unions as part of their strategy of protecting their unfit members from the rigor of accountability does that view sit well you with you mr and ms educator

1801619 i think you really need some form of detection on the spot
1801620 you always want good intelligence but it doesnt mean you shouldnt be looking for this stuff right now
1801621 it seems to me that the way forward might not be to analyse every bottle
1801622 lasers are highly precise and cause negligible damage to surrounding areas
1801623 they are also much safer to people in the vicinity of the threat
1801624 as long as youve got the fuel to power vehicles you have electrical energy available
1801625 its not easy to get as much energy in a laser beam as in an m 16 rifle bullet then you have to aim it and hold it on the target long enough to damage it
1801626 while those things have been done under controlled conditions at test ranges its much more difficult under the uncontrolled conditions of battle
1801627 the french government hasnt even answered our letters we feel that shows a lack of respect for the institutions of tahiti
1801628 the autonomy becomes absolutely critical there because of the radio signal travel time
1801629 it could actually move around the space shuttle and inspect the spacecraft
1801630 its not far fetched to think that you could equip such little satellites with radio frequency jammers or technologies to block image capability
1801631 theres a huge potential for this to be used as an anti satellite weapon of some sort
1801632 our intent is to be able to do a proof of concept of how to provide space situational awareness and host characterisation
1801633 the results indicate burial in landfill will not result in a massive release of toxic chemicals
1801634 our work can now be used by scientists who specialise in health effects to confirm that landfill disposal is acceptable
1801635 materials like these would normally be disposed of by incineration
1801636 the model clearly shows these chemical agents break down fairly quickly largely due to hydrolysis by water
1801637 but theres no indication of the amounts that might be left on debris after an attack for example just how much sarin gas will be left on a piece of concrete exposed to it
1801638 neither extensive electrical testing nor reverse engineering is capable of reliably detecting compromised microelectronics components

1801646 during the cold war the principal objection in the united states to a nuclear weapon free world was that you could not get there that objection melted away with the soviet union

1801661 as long as men massacre animals the will kill each other indeed he who sow the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love
1801662 i thought i would end with this writing as this sounds in my head and disturbs me to this day as much as the first time that i read it
1801663 its a community house where we live with other families who are also christians we help each other out in life pray together and try to care for creation together
1801664 horses are supposed to be protected if people dont pay attention before they know it there are not going to be any wild horses and i think thatll be a great loss
1801665 the bottom line is weve run out of things to do with these animals
1801666 there are pros and cons to each method but were not at that point
1801667 the potential for wholesale killing of thousands of healthy wild horses marks a complete turnaround in management policy
1801668 living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west
1801669 to set the record straight euthanasia is mercy killing thats certainly not whats being proposed here by any stretch of the imagination
1801670 its killing pure and simple to balance the books for an agency whose reckless management has caused immeasurable harm to a national treasure
1801671 is a long standing concern and must not be used as a death sentence
1801672 any time they talk about killing wild horses its disturbing
1801673 what its going to take is a public outcry to hopefully reverse that kind of thinking people need to contact their legislators
1801674 theres other ways of thinking about it instead of just saying weve got too many horses lets shoot em
1801675 if it doesnt double check what youve typed against whats written here all those angle brackets and things should be identical
1801676 ive been in touch with the charities and it doesnt look like they have received any of the money that was meant for them
1801677 you just really feel bad for your guests that they have to go through all of this with you when it was meant to be a really happy time
1801678 were angry and were upset as far as were concerned it is our guests money they want to support us in our life together and wrapit and potentially hsbc have stolen that from us its not good enough
1801679 some of these new grooms and brides its their first time setting out in life gifts are supposed to be there to help them on their way
1801680 its a disappointment a let down wrapit is supposed to deliver and they havent hsbc who knows we just want to see some justice
1801681 frankly we are so ridiculously embarrassed on behalf of all of our guests and loved ones the people we care about the most are the ones who basically funded this company thats gone under and the bank are not willing to honour the debts
1801682 we feel there is a solution on the table that the bank can adopt but theyre just refusing to do so and we want to encourage them to adopt it and do the right thing

1801707 the foreign correspondents club of japan hereby adds its voice to calls for chinese authorities and the international olympic committee to fully lift restrictions on internet access for journalists covering the olympics
1801708 our colleagues in beijing tell us that sites related to tibet and falun gong are still blocked these limitations fall short of the complete freedom to report promised by wang wei secretary general of the beijing olympic bidding committee in 2001
1801709 governments cannot be the judge of the information journalists need to broadcast in an accurate well investigated impartial way its crucial for journalists all over the world to report in a complete and fair way about the olympics
1801710 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1801711 even if we work hard to expand internal demand while the population declines it wont be enough
1801712 it will be necessary to bring in people commodities and money from developing areas
1801713 our country has such a long history and abundant nature with four seasons
1801714 although itami is a domestic airport it is certainly indispensable for the kansai region
1801715 kansais economic activities are based in the north near itami the importance of itami cant be denied
1801716 will be in trouble if all public works expenditures including for snow removal and disaster relief disappears
1801717 it is necessary for us to distribute resources while considering such things

1801720 he was identified by survivors he had fled texas which is not particularly helpful
1801721 he never was willing to acknowledge he committed the crime we really didnt have evidence to put on
1801722 the crude oil market remains at a historically high level
1801723 we judged that we would not be able to manage our business from now on if we do not reduce the number of flights
1801724 at present we are not considering any further review for this fiscal year
1801725 however we must continue to carefully watch the fuel market demand trends and business environmental changes
1801726 we can only hope that fuel prices will soon drop
1801727 im fed up with credit card company tricks that drive us deeper in debt
1801728 because right now my season with just two wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1801729 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into this event i would have loved to have won last week theres no arguing that point but i really needed to be there like i was
1801730 when im playing a course im trying to take half the trouble out of play
1801731 so i want to set up down the right edge of the fairway and hit a cut and if i miss it left it doesnt bother me what bothers me is if i hook it

1801735 stephen dufour manager of fidelity focused stock is no stranger to our ranking top notches he took over this fund in march last year and turned its performance up a notch finishing the year up 17 vs 5 5 for his s amp p 500 benchmark bam
1801736 with 52 holdings this fund is focused his top 10 basically says it all a diversified play on global growth in a stock pickers portfolio southwestern energy norfolk southern range resources t rowe price nrg energy unilever eaton cisco cabot oil amp gas and apple
1801737 tom soviero manager at fidelity leveraged company stock has jumped from the third spot in the december rankings to the top spot this time around
1801738 his top ranked status reflects his stock picking expertise the portfolio continues to become even more concentrated in his top 10 picks 29 4 of the funds assets now vs 27 six months ago
1801739 the fund remains a unique diversifier most growth oriented investors could benefit from including it in their mix by virtue of the fact that it wont correlate with anything they currently own it is up 7 1 year to date which is something we cant say about many other funds at this time
1801740 energy still amounts to almost of the names industrials 12 4 materials 11 7 and technology 9 9 represent his other biggest stakes together they look like a road map whose performance success swings on a global growth hinge
1801741 bill kennedy uses a classic bottoms up boots on the ground go anywhere approach at fidelity international discovery
1801742 his stock picking style is based on broad diversification among countries uk tops the list with japan in second while germany switzerland france australia spain usa canada and hong kong round out the foreign market map of his markets
1801743 the fund is broadly diversified 233 holdings with his top ten holdings accounting for just 16 of total assets he continues to provide this portfolio with solid large cap picks that makes him a strong complement to the far more aggressive regionally focused intl fund above
1801744 george stairs manager at fidelity international value has been steadily climbing in our rankings his diversified regional and industry approach is complemented by his concentrated number of holdings 138 with 27 of his funds assets in his top 10 picks
1801745 in a stock pickers market this fund like focused stock above tends to either standout or fall hard on the managers stock picking merits or lack thereof
1801746 his top 10 names toyota roche unicredit banco santander mitsui allianz se daimler royal dutch axa total cars pharmaceuticals commercial banks trading companies insurance oil and gas are present and accounted for in his large cap established intl market tilt toward the value side of the global markets fence
1801747 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game

1801750 obama is a celebrity wants to raise taxes how dare he he doesnt understand us elitist and disconnected liberal whos too inexperienced im john mccain and i approve of this message
1801751 is your modem plugged in did you try restarting it
1801752 we are at an unusually good moment for the us in space and it wont last
1801753 we dont worry as much about nuclear attacks on our satellites as we used to and i think thats a mistake
1801754 i think most countries could pull off an anti satellite strike on the first try
1801755 you dont have to get that close to destroy something
1801756 some countries have had anti satellite weapons in the past
1801757 we have in fact deployed some of our own terrestrial based counter communication capabilities so we can be in a position to deal with an adversary
1801758 it supplies critically needed experimental support for the idea that positive attitude which is generally a beneficial feature of human behaviour may lead to overconfidence and damaging behaviour in the case of war
1801759 those who expected to do best tended to do worst
1801760 this suggests that positive illusions were not only misguided but actually may have been detrimental to performance in this scenario
1801761 so its not maleness per se but narcissism that makes some people overly optimistic and aggressive
1801762 this study fits within a relatively new field of research which connects motivations of individual people to their collective behaviour
1801763 one wishes that members of the bush administration had known about this research before they initiated invasion of iraq three years ago
1801764 i think it would be fair to say that the general opinion of political scientists is that the bush administration was overconfident of victory and that the iraq war is a debacle
1801765 perhaps most disconcerting is that todays leaders are above average in narcissism
1801766 people are dying needlessly its important that the federal government is now taking this seriously
1801767 i think this is going to make a huge difference in avoiding these confrontations
1801768 i promise you no one no one will be able to ignore it
1801769 right now this has the ability to save multiple lives per day
1801770 the safety of drivers eyes may depend on the split second judgement of the operator
1801771 due to its extraordinary high rate of fire capability it delivers its bullets 8 5 millimetres apart thereby delivering more mass to the target than any other weapon
1801772 overwhelming and devastating firepower were talking about total target saturation
1801773 it all depends on the sort of power source you have
1801774 id be very interested to know what its range is

1801778 its been passed down from the regiment that there is a threat of insurgents utilizing oil smuggling to transport and fund their operations
1801779 these towns are like home ground for smuggling and were here to ensure it stops
1801780 most people in iraq want to live their lives in a safe and secure environment and if the enemy elements are invading the town the residents are in danger
1801781 when we put a dent in the oil smuggling and insurgency operations we thereby lay a dent in al qaeda of iraq
1801782 denying al qaeda access to the town will take away the opposition of the citys government and make it more effective

1801787 peppered with smart and witty comments on the education news of the day
1801788 i check eduwonk several times a day especially since i cut back on caffeine
1801789 i have just three go to websites the texas legislature texas longhorn sports and eduwonk
1801790 penetrating analysis in a lively style on a wide range of issues
1801791 were trying to find any information to fight the insurgency that remains in this area of operations
1801792 it helps fight the war if we show our faces around the area and provide the people protection
1801793 these people that live in this area are citizens who make an honest living farming or herding its our job and the iraqi security forces job to ensure they arent influenced with corruption
1801794 i understand those houses are in the middle of the desert and all these people want to do is have a good life for their families
1801795 were visiting and talking to those people because its easy for those smugglers or insurgents to take advantage of them
1801796 if the people help us stop the insurgency it will bring stability in the region and build infrastructure for the future
1801797 we went from being a security force to being advisors to the isf and now its time to finish the job
1801798 were just having a little fun whenever we have time off from missions everyday
1801799 its nice to find something that brings a taste of home and be exercising at the same time
1801800 the activities make you feel better because youre with your fellow marines
1801801 whenever youre exercising you go into your own world where the stresses melt away
1801802 its good for the marines to relax establish camaraderie and hang out with others you havent seen in a while because of the tempo
1801803 its downright fun and that causes marines to unite through friendly competition
1801804 our company decided it would be a good idea because it provides a more accurate assessment of the patrol force
1801805 we picked it up on the fly and ran with it
1801806 i interviewed and hand picked the marines that would fit the profile of a good intelligence representative
1801807 ive managed a lot of people in my life and these marines are the most talented and well balanced group ive ever been in charge of
1801808 i love being part of the clic its the best thing i could do as a job in iraq
1801809 it feels good to know that im helping out our unit and the next unit tremendously with the information we gather we save lives because of the information we acquire
1801810 my grandmother has had it really hard her entire life
1801811 her life has consisted of running away and surviving she is the strongest person i know and probably will ever know
1801812 the country was in such a horrible condition but after the marines came she no longer heard or saw violence and death
1801813 i was motivated to join the corps because south korea was such a small nation that was invaded by its neighbors
1801814 the marines saved millions of lives and now the country is one of the most technologically advanced and richest countries in the world
1801815 the service has changed my life and made me appreciate all of the small things in living
1801816 when it comes to knowing his job cpl shin is the most efficient marine at it
1801817 because of his teachings i have become a more well rounded and knowledgeable marine
1801818 shin is always the first to volunteer for any extra duties
1801819 were engaging in urban combat using the fundamentals of the enhanced marksmanship program
1801820 this is a building block approach system of training they have to breach positively identify enemy and neutral targets clear establish a casualty collection point and evacuate casualties
1801821 each phase will be done four times so everyone in each team of four marines will get the chance to do everything
1801822 there are three phases in the first phase marines will come in and engage targets marked with letters and numbers to show whether they are hostile or neutral
1801823 after they engage the targets one man will go down with a simulated close range gunshot wound one marine will establish a casualty collection point and then he will call in a corpsman to treat the casualty
1801824 i supervised cpl burgos as she built the mwr read board because she had never built anything in her life
1801825 he walked me through the steps of how to build the board i needed
1801826 he really helped me and if i had to do another project i have a better foundation to complete it on my own
1801827 we were going through the town to find out where stores are located who the owners are and what they sell
1801828 we wanted to get an idea of how the town makes money and supports it self
1801829 the questions tie into figuring out how their government is doing
1801830 we ask what the problems in the city are and if something is wrong we can take a closer look at the situation
1801831 theyve grown up with marines around most of their lives theyre comfortable with us
1801832 into the atomic sunshine post war art under japanese peace constitution article 9
1801833 in 2006 former prime minister shinzo abe started talking about the possibility of changing the japanese constitution in other words article 9
1801834 i thought there should be a discussion on this matter
1801835 the disintegration of yugoslavia after the crash of the ussr and the effect of the new nation state and how this structure influenced the value of art
1801836 my family has a small business in shizuoka so i had to study economics
1801837 a lot of my friends at school were really into music and film so i was already like a curator when i bought a photo book of andy warhol or something i would always bring it to school and look at it with friends
1801838 japan doesnt have a strong infrastructure to think about constructive arguments new york is much easier for me to do things i have more freedom sometimes i get a lot of criticism in japan
1801839 sometimes because i will exhibit ouras emperor collage in 1986 300 rightwingers came to the museum and the prefectural assembly to complain
1801840 art doesnt have the power to influence something very strongly
1801841 but it can be like a playground where a lot of people come together to talk like scientists politicians artists even part timers
1801842 article 9 is an international issue it is japan saying to the world that we will never fight against you
1801843 aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order the japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes in order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained the right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized
1801844 a few among us were legal experts but most of us were not they were university professors bureaucrats businessmen
1801845 was successful for 60 years for japan because of it for the last 60 years japan didnt kill anyone
1801846 ok now youre writing the iraqi constitution you say that the ghq did a great job with the japanese occupation so why cant it do so in iraq but no you have to study exactly what happened in japan
1801847 the japanese self defense forces to be divided into two one part for self defense and the other to be provided to the united nations
1801848 i applied to so many japanese corporations for sponsorship for the show like over 50 and they all said no because its too political
1801849 but almost without exception they are japanese who live in foreign countries they understand art on a global scale they have the capacity to understand this kind of project

1801851 people deserve and expect a more effective government at a better price
1801852 say what you will about barack obama and i say a lot of negative things about him
1801853 we need leaders and john mccain is positive as well people gravitate when youve got something positive to say
1801854 his oratory is one of were going to do big tackle big national issues
1801855 if you look at his record theres not one issue of major national concern that he has led the effort on
1801856 it is simply a matter of fact that less than four years ago he was a state legislator
1801857 we are running against competitors that give the impression they are giving away free stuff
1801858 it is simply a matter of fact that less than four years ago he was a state legislator
1801859 we certainly understand why people are so surprised to see
1801860 qui a un go t de vieille cave et qui est le meilleur fromage du monde
1801861 we are thrilled that bill will be our coach for years to come
1801862 he has done a tremendous job leading the kansas mens basketball program both on and off the court theres no one id rather have at the helm of the kansas program
1801863 im very thankful to chancellor hemenway and lew for the confidence they have shown in me i have said many times that i cannot imagine a better place to play or to coach than the university of kansas my family and i look forward to being part of the kansas and lawrence communities for many years to come
1801864 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
1801865 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
1801866 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
1801867 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want
1801868 major news story when a presidential candidate receives money from a bastion of islamic terrorism
1801869 bending over backwards to help barack obama and cover up any negative news about him
1801870 there shouldve been an easier way in getting him to talk
1801871 hes not exactly talking friend i wanted him scared and angry the two emotions being interconnected mahmoud over there is your typical bully he can kill innocent women and children and wont even blink an eye the only thing that he truly feared however we delivered in the most effective way possible now hes angry and anger makes a person vulnerable
1801872 the guy still tried to kill hundreds if not thousands of innocent ukrainians
1801873 ah merely an amateurish operation that fire which burned the truck ensured that they will live to see another day thats fighting terrorism in a nutshell sometimes lucks with us and sometimes its not we just need to be alert and take advantage of every break that luck provides and resilient enough to absorb that which it takes away
1801874 again why am i looking like a much inflated arab
1801875 im not saying that youre going to survive an encounter with a raging mob of infuriated muslims that wouldnt suit well for either of us we just need to be able to tour around in automobiles or perhaps check into some fleabag of a hotel and looking less like two white boys from alpena michigan will help us do so
1801876 yes but i dont want our friend there to get the notion that he might be able to start something against ihor and yevhen
1801877 we wouldve have taken this assignment had we not anticipated trouble
1801878 but i dont want to tell your wife or mrs skibinecky that you guys were killed because we aggravated the situation
1801879 ive got enough problems already with pissing off god on umpteen occasions i dont need to start thinking about some damn arab deity
1801880 this is about lets make the best thing we possibly can
1801881 i definitely wanted to give her a more athletic feel shes an amazon

1801889 a highly classified sensitive operation with far reaching national security implications that took place in 1968
1801890 a redacted archaeological team uncovered a large metallic object in a remote area of southern redacted which is a close nato ally of ours
1801891 the object was believed to be an alien spacecraft that had crashed approximately 200 million years ago according to the archaeological team the site subsequently was examined by a usaf recovery team which then put the age of the alien craft at approximately 150 million years ago
1801892 our scientists used the absolute dating method employing decaying radioactive isotopes sedimentary rock formations and the fact that the object was embedded into the rock were used to estimate the age of the alien craft
1801893 the craft was transported to the state of redacted and then to the giant redacted lab complex in redacted and opened
1801894 the alien craft contained two highly decomposed alien bodies and decayed animals which were apparently abducted by these alien beings the animals were small dinosaurs on board the alien craft
1801895 the craft was stored at redacted and years of intense research were conducted the last time i checked the research team ruled out the craft being of eben origin
1801896 however no one could tell where it came from the alien bodies were far too decomposed to be thoroughly examined they were about 5 feet tall and had very large bulbous heads
1801897 to the best of my knowledge operation redacted is still an ongoing project i personally worked on the operation in the early 70s
1801898 the instruments from the craft were interesting because they were made of small crystal like devices wired together with a form of very fine wire
1801899 the alien propulsion system contained a large chamber with what we called rocks obviously some form of energy in the chamber large vents placed around the chamber vented some sort of power radiation or some form of tremendous energy generated through the vents and into the propulsion chamber which enabled interstellar space travel
1801900 examination of the rocks found zinc and several unknown materials and alloys which we still cannot identify to this day the rocks obviously lost all of their energy over the years they were not radioactive nor did they contain any special properties we could never power up the alien craft in the nearly 40 years weve had possession of it
1801901 we could not locate the actual power system and therefore could never operate any of the equipment contained within the craft however we did find a star chart the chart was created from outside of the earth on the alien home world
1801902 to this day we have been unable to read and decipher the alien star chart the star chart was of a deep area of space but our scientists havent been able to find that specific area of space
1801903 the amazing alien technology on this craft has similarly stumped us while some progress has been made on it since 1968 its been minimal partially due to the poor degraded condition of the alien craft
1801904 the existence of alien civilizations who had already achieved space traveling capabilities zipping around the milky way galaxy and perhaps others truly boggles the mind
1801905 the ebens were perhaps still in their galactic diapers when these alien beings were already visiting other worlds 150 200 mya million years ago and homo sapiens did not even exist
1801906 one can only wonder and speculate where a civilization that had already achieved interstellar space travel would be at today technologically from 150 200 mya
1801907 how many star systems have they visited by now how many other alien civilizations have they made successful contact and interacted with and perhaps carry on some sort of trade with how many solar systems have they visited and mapped out in our milky way galaxy and perhaps those of other galaxies
1801908 one also has to consider the possibility that rather than this crash having occurred in our timeline of 150 200 mya these alien beings traveled to earth from the future to our distant past when dinosaurs ruled as part of a research mission that also boggles the mind
1801909 strong familiarity and experience with gaming consoles and windows based pcs
1801910 if we win two gold medals on the first day of the judo competition then hopefully the momentum will carry over to the swimming and athletics events
1801911 we want the gold medals to run into double digits
1801912 i feel a great opportunity in being able to take on this challenge for an incredible record of winning gold even as a mother
1801913 i am very happy and looking forward to the chance to challenge hansen this is the olympics so it means a lot
1801914 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1801915 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1801916 will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
1801917 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1801918 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short im not involved in two of the formats i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1801919 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1801920 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down it is going to take some getting used to someone else being in charge
1801921 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge
1801922 it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1801923 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1801924 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way
1801925 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1801926 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time
1801927 if he doesnt score runs at the moment england are well and truly out of just about any competition they need him doing that
1801928 theres going to be a lot of pressure on him now i must admit i wouldve let kevin keep being the no 1 batsman but who do you give it to in that group
1801929 hell be very aggressive and hell be looking to always take control and be in command of everything that he is doing
1801930 this exchange traded fund allows you to short the market or profit from a decline while giving you far greater diversification than picking out a few weak individual stocks
1801931 the etf is designed to perform like a mirror image of the dow jones industrial average times two in other words for every percentage point the dow loses this etf should gain two
1801932 of course the opposite is also true a substantial rise in the dow would cause this fund to lose money twice as quickly
1801933 and while i believe there are some bargains in the dow i i think a few names in the relatively concentrated list of 30 stocks are due for more pain more importantly investors will likely sell stocks willy nilly whenever a new piece of bad news hits the wires
1801934 such is the nature of bear markets i expect we will see rallies followed by additional losses for all these reasons the ultrashort dow etf is the perfect way to begin hedging our
1801935 the beauty of these hedging devices is that they not only help protect your long positions but they also give you a relatively easy way to try and book some gains in down markets for now i recommend you buy this etf at 60 or better and then place a stop loss at 50
1801936 global steel producers are thriving and their stocks are hitting new highs
1801937 were still in the early stage of a truly global bull market cycle for steel and the companies best positioned to take advantage are headed a lot higher
1801938 as is the case with other building blocks of economic growth steel is enjoying explosive demand from the developing world and with the world expanding as never before steel companies are literally selling as fast as they can produce
1801939 in the august 2007 we highlighted five first rate global steel producers since then theyve returned an average of 67 4 versus a decline of 3 7 for the s amp p 500
1801940 the iron five are five picks that we believe are ripe for even bigger gains like the last group these stocks are often volatile theyre also vulnerable to the possibility of a general stock market slide and most of all to a dip in global demand growth particularly from china
1801941 more important however all of these titans of steel are well run businesses positioned to cash in on healthy global steel demand for years to come the cornerstone of that outperformance demand for steel has grown faster elsewhere than its slowed in the us
1801942 the us is still an important consumer of steel but is increasingly less critical in driving global demand and setting the price
1801943 topping our list is mechel russias second largest producer of long steel products the company also operates in lithuania and other countries in central and eastern europe a region thats growing nearly as fast as emerging asia
1801944 mechels ace in the hole is a mining business that focuses on raw materials used to make steel primarily coking coal iron ore nickel and steam coal
1801945 south korea based posco is the fourth largest steel producer and one of the lowest cost integrated mills in the world the companys major export destinations are china japan southeast asia and the us making it a major beneficiary of chinas move to consolidate its steel industry
1801946 the company recently inaugurated its first commercial plant based on its proprietary finex process which provides the same clean metallic feedstock as traditional blast furnaces but costs less and has fewer environmental and fixed cost disadvantages
1801947 us based nucor is our favorite american steel company the us steel industry of today is much smaller than in the past but has also achieved higher profitability while becoming competitive globally
1801948 one of the original mini mills north carolina based nucor has historically relied on small very efficient processes and the use of scrap metal demonstrating its success its now the second largest us based steel producer and this countrys largest recycler
1801949 brazil based gerdau is the best positioned player to take advantage of increasing demand for steel products in latin america particularly brazil it also has major exposure to the us market
1801950 the use of mainly mini mills means that the company doesnt use metallurgical coal which gives it a considerable cost advantage amid rising coal prices is also runs its own service centers and distribution channels giving it more control over downstream costs and consequently profit margins
1801951 luxembourg based arcelormittal which operates in 20 countries is one of the most integrated players in the industry and boasts one of the best marketing departments
1801952 the companys truly global operations are a great platform for participating in growth worldwide it can occasionally create some problems as some of the countries in which it operates include ukraine and kazakhstan those political risks are balanced by its sheer reach
1801953 ibm is one of the best of the blue chips the stocks long term chart show the stock now challenging its all time high it has just edged out from an eight week cup and handle base today
1801954 the stock has made a 52 week high and is in position to make an all time high it just needs to get over the high of 139 18 set in july of 1999
1801955 ibm is one of the largest it solutions providers in the world it designs computer systems and software and provides related services its hardware products account for 22 of sales
1801956 ibm is also a leader in middleware software 20 of sales which enables disparate computer applications to communicate it also offers a variety of services that make up 55 of sales they include outsourcing maintenance and systems integration
1801957 this year analysts predict ibm will rack up a 23 gain in profits to 8 75 a share from 7 13 a year ago the stock sells with a price earnings ratio of 14 we see that as low given the growth rate this year in earnings looking out to 2009 the street expects net to climb 11 to 9 73 a share
1801958 in our opinion the big institutional money has to go somewhere ibm appears to be one of those places we are calling for ibm to advance to 150 within the next few months a protective stop can be placed near 125
1801959 we rates ibm a conservative play but one that can work higher with lower risk than other blue chips traders can also use the stock as a near term trading play
1801960 i need no warrant for being and no word of sanction upon my being i am the warrant and the sanction
1801961 due to certain issues the american people in the past years have been denied correct and clear information about global developments and are eager to hear different opinions
1801962 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1801963 organizations need to implement both data protection policy and enforcement
1801964 one measure is insufficient blind enforcement without a well thought out policy can lead to decreases in productivity and outright rebellion against it controls policy without enforcement does little to deter the well motivated insider
1801965 the cost of losing or compromising the integrity of pii is also leading to a renewed focus on information security
1801966 the survey shows that 81 percent of the 1 600 respondents who named information security management as a number 3 concern said that security risks are not fully known or are only partially assessed using technology
1801967 if just one machine with access to critical data is left outside the enforcement domain the outsider threat and the insider threat and associated risks remain
1801968 it functions and projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organizations
1801969 the ability to monitor system activity as well as inspect the content of files being transmitted or sitting at rest in storage devices for sensitive information or foreign applications is very important in mitigating these types of threats
1801970 they have bird flu symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties
1801971 when we first started we didnt have much experience and patients tended to be suspicious if these medications would work so their adherence was not good and that resulted in higher rates of drug resistance
1801972 to do drug tests we need to have cancer cells in cultures
1801973 we take the cancer cells add the targeted therapy drug agent and show whether it can kill or not kill
1801974 they are in a new environment they are discriminated against they are living in harsh conditions sometimes just in boxes covered in plastic near the farms where they work
1801975 when people live that way they engage in high risk behaviour
1801976 but this study confirms that ptsd is a major cause of heart disease
1801977 men in the study on average were in their mid 50s yet they were developing heart disease from ptsd and dying too early
1801978 there is a real buzz around the town at the moment and we can sense the excitement the fans have for this season
1801979 there are still some great tickets available but they are selling fast and at this moment in time we are on course to be a sell out come kick off on saturday
1801980 his name was mentioned but we have got to look at the make up of the team
1801981 we have got to look at the togetherness we have and look at do we really need this sort of player like robbie at this time
1801982 i felt like i couldnt do anything wrong my confidence was so high every time i stepped on the field it was really frustrating not playing at derby the number one thing you want to do is play and if youre not playing then youre wondering what youre doing there we were losing most of our games and i still didnt get the opportunity to play the injury was the lowest point of the entire year but it was also the turning point i felt like i was seeing more clearly what it really took to get back into the national team picture i know myself what i can do and im really looking forward to this the olympics to prove it to myself my coaches and my team mates that i am the player they thought i was a year ago
1801983 bob let me know he knew it was a tough time for me
1801984 he and peter gave me good advice they told me to keep fighting
1801985 when benny came into camp you could see his confidence was down the whole thing had clearly taken a toll on him its always difficult for a national team coach to call in a player who isnt seeing first team action no matter how good he is the question then becomes can this player still contribute if hes not on his game and if you dont call him do you risk eroding his self confidence even more

1801997 am i willing to take the action i most need to for success am i also willing to step back and just allow events to unfold when i find myself trying too hard with no results
1801998 as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1801999 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now
1802000 baseless smears about a muslim with a very good reputation was used to marginalize not only him but the community from the political process
1802001 if someone like mr asbahi cant be vetted to work for the obama campaign then who can
1802002 i know someday youll have a beautiful life i know youll be a star in somebody elses sky but why why why cant it be oh cant it be mine
1802003 era inevit vel o cheiro de am ndoas amargas lhe lembrava sempre o destino dos amores contrariados
1802004 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their homes in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of health care and we need to end the out of control spending in washington thats putting our debt on the backs of our children nows the time for action and when im president we are gonna get it done
1802005 more money in family jobs more money in family budgets and growing jobs and small businesses
1802006 as long as americans insist on a living wage well drive business overseas
1802007 we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their homes in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of health care and we need to end the out of control spending in washington
1802008 were taxing them out of the country unfortunately sen obamas plans would raise taxes on businesses even more hes promised tax increases on income tax increases on investment tax increases on small businesses thats exactly the wrong strategy raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you can do because it will kill even more jobs what we need are policies that create jobs
1802009 hes the original maverick really hes for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar and for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas the original maverick or just more of the same
1802010 dont have any of that info yet will get it to you when i do
1802011 we are not going to release information about our buy but it would be fair to say that it will run in places the mccain ad runs
1802012 exxon mobil paid 10 5 billion in income taxes last quarter there i said it now can we stop the e mails
1802013 feel the pain of people in this economy loosing their homes when he has eight to spare or talk about energy conservation with his own consumption bordering on the obscene

1802019 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is for them to be abolished
1802020 the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the priority is human survival
1802021 i today here in hiroshima again pledge that our country will firmly maintain the three antinuclear principles and take the lead in international society to realize the abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting peace

1802031 we burst into hysterics my sister had made a joke about twins literally the night before because my grandparents and sis both had twins angie was on the table during the sonogram and we were in hysterics we didnt see this one coming
1802032 ze maakt haar vriend regelmatig duidelijk dat ze huisje boompje beestje nog lang niet ziet zitten ook schuift cameron een ontmoeting met haar schoonfamilie in engeland steeds uit
1802033 en als de meiden op stap gaan hebben ze geen gebrek aan bewonderaars
1802034 shes at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart ok quotes a source as saying
1802035 countrywide conned customers into loans that were clearly unaffordable and unsustainable turning the american dream of homeownership into a nightmare
1802036 i built this list because a lot of my friends are reporters and they call me all the time for sources rather than go through my contact lists each time i figured i could push the requests out to people who actually have something to say
1802037 by joining this list just promise me and yourself that youll ask yourself before you send a response is this response really on target is this response really going to help the journalist or is this just a bs way for me to get my client in front of the reporter if you have to think for more than three seconds chances are you shouldnt send the response
1802038 we are looking for commercial investment real estate news deals made exec moves general news etc
1802039 die rimpelige grijze kerel heeft me in zijn campagnefilmpje gebruikt en ik ga ervan uit dat dat betekent dat ik nu ook een presidentskandidaat ben
1802040 h amerika ik ben paris hilton en ik ben ook een celebrity ik kom alleen niet uit de goede oude tijd en ik beloof geen veranderingen zoals die andere vent
1802041 ik ben zeg maar helemaal klaar om het land te leiden
1802042 energiecrisis opgelost ik zie jullie wel weer bij de debatten
1802043 how else do i love thee let us count a ways
1802044 we are so excited to be working with university of phoenix on this tour it truly represents what the myspace music platform is all about creating unique opportunities for artists fans and brands to connect around music
1802045 kates tour last spring was unbelievable and an even bigger turnout than we ever expected this time we have a unique opportunity to give her fans a glimpse behind the scenes as kate maintains balance between life on the road and her college education which her fans are going to love
1802046 i t would be a surprising thing if congress in order to prevent a misapplication of antitrust legislation to labor unions had bestowed upon such unions complete and unreviewable authority to aid business groups to frustrate its primary objective
1802047 defendants sell an illegal pyramid scheme that uses minor incidental sale of travel as a front for their scheme
1802048 of the more than 200 000 consumers who purchased or maintained defendants web sites during 2007 62 failed to earn a single travel commission not even on their own personal travel the typical participant made no money on the sale of travel furthermore the typical annual travel commission earned was less than the cost of just one month for a consumer to maintain his or her web site even among those california residents who participated in defendants program for at least one year from april 1 2006 to march 31 2007 and who paid defendants at least 1 000 45 did not sell any travel and 61 made less income on the sale of travel than the cost of one months use of their website
1802049 73 of their net revenue of over 141 million dollars was from the sale of web sites and monthly fees another 10 was generated through the sale to consumers of training and marketing materials only 14 5 of defendants net revenue were generated from the sale of travel
1802050 defendants operate a travel card mill to permit and encourage consumers to hold themselves out as sellers of travel through the use of credentials purporting to identify them as professional travel agents who sell travel and are thus eligible for discounts upgrades or other courtesies
1802051 we are disappointed that the state has decided to take this action we firmly believe that the facts in this matter support our position and our legal counsel has advised us that our position is strong the company will vigorously defend this matter and we look forward to having the courts decide the merits of our case
1802052 growing your business planting the seeds for a strong harvest
1802053 the marketing and business development team has worked hard to create an all inclusive conference that has everything our agents need to be knowledgeable and competitive in the industry
1802054 we have a large number of agents and suppliers attending and we are still accepting registrations for this years conference well also be accepting pre registrations at the end of the cruise from agents who want to attend next years conference
1802055 the fact that msc cruises is sending two of its newest and largest ships to the caribbean reinforces our commitment to the north american market
1802056 we are excited to be able to offer our travel agent partners the opportunity to allow their clients to enjoy the msc cruises experience in the caribbean on such beautiful new ships
1802057 it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges
1802058 i know that sen mccain likes to call himself a maverick and the fact is there have been times where in the past he did show some independence
1802059 but the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position and now he embraces the failed bush policies of the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and then not a maverick when it doesnt work for you and youre seeking your parties nomination
1802060 our current president ran for the nations highest office promising us that he would be a uniter not a divider well it didnt quite work out that way now did it its about time we had a president who not only said it but meant it and barack obama will
1802061 at a time when were spending 10 billion a month in iraq theyve got almost 80 billion thats not being invested in services for suffering iraqis or reconstruction
1802062 some of this money is sitting in american banks in new york on wall street collecting interest while you the taxpayer are paying for reconstruction efforts in iraq thats why weve got to bring about fundamental change
1802063 do they think that the economy is working right now do they think our foreign policy is working right now if they do then they should work their heart out for john mccain because his policies are not different from what george bush has been offering
1802064 but if you think that we need fundamental change if you think that we can create a brighter future and we can have a more serious politics than we have right now one that focuses on solving our problems instead of on paris hilton and britney spears then i need you to vote for me
1802065 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1802066 barack obamas continued assertion that americans simply inflating their car tires is equivalent to additional offshore oil drilling is wrong and underscores his lack of understanding of this issue
1802067 true energy independence requires john mccains all of the above approach which includes alternative energy additional offshore oil drilling and safe nuclear power
1802068 our current president ran for the nations highest office promising us that he would be a uniter not a divider
1802069 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1802070 he sparked laughter when he said that in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1802071 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
1802072 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
1802073 the death of this boy reflects the depth of the social breakdown we have reached
1802074 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1802075 this is another murder because no one has the right to take someone elses life only god
1802076 he has been a businessman who has lived and suffered the situation of businesses in mexico in the flesh and has been on the other side of the fence
1802077 its indispensable that this agency be in good hands in the hands of a capable honest person with a profound dedication to service to the country
1802078 we were a team and we had leaders our leaders were our senior ranking officers theyre the ones that when we failed they picked us up and sent us back into the fight and we didnt always win
1802079 more likely to enrich oil companies than to lower gas prices for american consumers
1802080 i think the problem with mccains position is that he keeps saying im in support for all of the above but when it comes down to specifics in what he will really support the only thing that comes through loud and clear is more drilling and i think that is the big vulnerability on his part
1802081 the tax the oil company issue is really difficult for republicans but the polling data indicates that the public thinks the oil companies have big role to play i dont know what is really going on here or if mccain is thinking this through carefully but i think this is undermining his credibility and to some degree is his hallmark approach looking for bipartisan solutions to problems
1802082 americans are watching you and millions of people will be watching including our soldiers and sailors and marines and airmen who are serving in iraq they are going to be watching
1802083 i hope they release us tonight so we can go home
1802084 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
1802085 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
1802086 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1802087 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1802088 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1802089 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1802090 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1802091 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1802092 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1802093 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
1802094 the courts run by the government are active around the country
1802095 today in his final term the wildly unpopular president george w
1802096 p erhaps our compassionate conservative in chief will bring our absent democrat congress some
1802097 my duty as president requires that i use every means within my power to get the laws the people need on matters of such importance and urgency i am therefore calling this congress back into session july 26th
1802098 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1802099 the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now
1802100 offshore drilling will not bring immediate relief but might change the mindset
1802101 see this guy gal is not so bad after all even though he she is a republican
1802102 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1802103 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1802104 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1802105 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1802106 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1802107 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1802108 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1802109 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1802110 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1802111 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1802112 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1802113 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1802114 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1802115 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1802116 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1802117 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1802118 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
1802119 wrote it as fast as possible and were publishing it as fast as possible because there is news in the book and we dont want to sit on it
1802120 nak kalo mau ngasih jangan kasih kami semuanya cukup sdikit aja asal bisa ngerasain gajimu aja lah dah cukup nak
1802121 ga usahlah kamu aja yang pegang mungkin ada yang mau dibeli jgn lupa kasih adekmu sdikit biar dia bisa ngersain gaji kakaknya ini
1802122 itukan gaji kamu penghasilan kamu yang pertama pula yang harus ngerasain itu kamu nak bukan mama
1802123 it gently stimulates the sexual nerve pathways taking the woman to a pre orgasmic plateau where she dangles on the edge of orgasm for as long as she wants
1802124 ive been using mine for three years and i just love it
1802125 if women feel they have problems with either sex or relationships its better to go and get professional advice about the possible causes before spending a lot of money on a particular product
1802126 hes been caught lying about his affair with rielle and their love child for many months and now the proof against him is piling up
1802127 my wife telephoned me and said i looked very shabby because i didnt wear a tie although all the other ministers wore them
1802128 i told her im not wearing a tie because im the environment minister i think it will still take a lot of effort to educate her
1802129 in space the intensity of solar energy is twice that on the ground and there are no clouds
1802130 i think japan needs to push for such projects actively
1802131 we need to confirm that this nuclear cooperation is satisfactory in the sense that it will maintain and further strengthen international nuclear disarmament and not undermine the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation regime
1802132 this is something we will not change our position on and still continue to ask india this
1802133 japan is the worlds only country to have suffered atomic bombings and we are aiming for the abolition of nuclear weapons through nonproliferation and disarmament
1802134 i am going to dance shiokumi as i first learned it rendering matsukazes inner feelings in each posture i will make
1802135 come on what you are you waiting for express yourself
1802136 the pure girl like world inside of me that is what lolita is all about
1802137 i think many japanese women feel intimidated by high fashion in the west and feel that they can never live up to the refined beauty that they feel western women strive for
1802138 so instead they shoot for a cute look one that doesnt require tall curvaceous bodies and instead emphasizes girlishness
1802139 one of the salient points about lolita is that it is really a fashion that is not intended to attract men
1802140 the women are creating their own world into which they can get away from the pressures of the larger society
1802141 i dont know if we can ever really hope to conquer foreign markets
1802142 but i think gothic lolita is the best example there is of the tokyo look we are really on the edge
1802143 its 4th of july will smith brings you a movie and you bring your spf to a famous beach the hula to california and the blues to portland
1802144 i want foreigners to see what china has achieved we were called the sick man of asia now we are strong and rich enough to hold such a major international event
1802145 socialism is great a workers memoir of the new china
1802146 from the wii dmv to biking to work joshua tree music festival to punniest of show photos in dumbo
1802147 dont do it you wont like it stay under the covers
1802148 by ignoring the north koreans you will not get cooperation in a million years
1802149 if windows has a gui and linux has a gui why can i a
1802150 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1802151 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1802152 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1802153 we could do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1802154 that way the offshore drilling carries us until new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence
1802155 energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1802156 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1802157 his image of himself was always the handsome celebrity flyboy
1802158 took back a private promise to join mccains campaign finance reform effort
1802159 mccain could dismiss w as a lightweight but he knows obamas smart obama wrote his own books while mccains were written by salter
1802160 a commitment to civil rights which transcends partisan labels and political attacks
1802161 weve got guys that dont care about situations that happen on or off the field
1802162 the doom and gloom that was in here two days ago and we end up with a 4 2 road trip and again were doing fine
1802163 when you get a team thats a little more experienced youre able to understand the situations confront them and move on
1802164 you can see that maturity with our team thats starting to show
1802165 he had his best velocity since ive been here he walked those two guys in the third inning and they scored but he did throw the ball better
1802166 ricky had great at bats sparked our offense big time
1802167 i was real proud of rickie rickie got hot this time of year last year too even though theres a lot of people that get on him because they really dont look beyond the day to day happenings rickies been swinging the bat very well since the all star break
1802168 it was just out of my reach if i had to do it over again id watch it and let brandon field it
1802169 the most important thing is that people are forced to open up to the world and accept different ideas
1802170 its good not only for sports but for human rights and freedom of speech
1802171 its good for the economy and more people here will get to know china and thats good
1802172 its very exciting well be cheering for china of course
1802173 the legacy of the 2008 olympics must not be thousands of chinese citizens languishing in labor camps
1802174 for my daughters itll impress upon them that the world is changing
1802175 i think that my kids have so many opportunities in the united states and its important for them to realize its good to know who you are and where youre from
1802176 hunter called my office last week and left a message and asked to meet with us this week and personally apologize
1802177 he started out by saying i made a mistake said some things that were wrong and ive learned from my mistake and apologize
1802178 weve now combined the welcome dinner on tuesday with the gala dinner on wednesday so those were old issues that were brought up
1802179 i dont care where he heard them from and i think if he makes the team hunter will probably feel very differently about it
1802180 i talked to him and told him i dont take those comments personally
1802181 hes apologized to the pga of america done all of the things hes needed to do to try to correct what was a little bit of a faux paux
1802182 this is a big week because right now my season with just a couple with just two wins is i think just ok
1802183 but if i were to able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1802184 i love the pga championship it is my favorite major
1802185 im a golf course owner and i feel like this tournament is the heart and soul of the pga and im just proud to be a part of it
1802186 these are probably some of the toughest greens youll ever see and a lot of slope a lot of undulation
1802187 you get above the hole very fast and then obviously the rough is up
1802188 so the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should be so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
1802189 the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power that it wont happen again i can tell you that much
1802190 if there is a perceived advantage ill try to exploit it
1802191 if theres something there ill try to find it and if theres nothing there theres nothing there
1802192 europes done a great job of exploiting course advantage on us for a long time they have the advantage of going to sites that the european players all know and the american players dont know
1802193 we dont have that advantage here because most of the europeans who play
1802194 they have been able to neutralize our power in the past by bringing the fairways in at certain points and forcing guys like tiger woods and phil mickelson to hit clubs off the tee where they will all end up in the same spot
1802195 i realize that the four picks is going to be a little more difficult than i thought
1802196 there are a lot of really quality options for me now
1802197 im looking for guys who are playing really well and have a lot of confidence and ive said that from the get go that i want players that are confident and that makes a big difference
1802198 experience is important but its also over rated anyone who has played in the last six ryder cups has experienced getting their arse beat so im not looking for experience
1802199 i dont see one single positive that tiger isnt on our team
1802200 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without arguably the greatest player who has ever lived
1802201 its an opportunity for a lot of guys you look at guys who have not won majors who are my age or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
1802202 if you look at the world rankings from fifth to 20th theres a lot of guys very bunched and playing very good golf there are so many guys that can win this week
1802203 ive had quite a few second places quite a few thirds and top fives so quite a few chances
1802204 but i think tiger a lot of times has just been way better
1802205 i remember in 2000 finishing second three times and twice to him in majors
1802206 i feel ive still got quite a few years left so ive got to keep pushing away
1802207 i get criticised in south africa a lot more than i get over here its something that ive had to live with for a while if tiger woods wasnt around i probably would have won a couple more majors but i dont feel like im done yet
1802208 ive got a very good feel about the golf course
1802209 my swing is in pretty good shape and i feel excited about this week i feel like i have a reasonably good chance at making a good showing and hopefully i have a chance on sunday
1802210 hes too big kelly pavlik is a big guy i tried middleweight once and what i learned is im not a middleweight i definitely wont be fighting kelly pavlik
1802211 if oscar fights whenever he fights im there and ill be in the corner
1802212 this is how i pay my bills and feed my family if he wants to fight pacquiao ill be there i was going to be there if he fought my son wasnt i
1802213 but if oscar wants to secure his legacy i would think hed have to fight someone like margarito or little floyd mayweather after that
1802214 any time youre playing a course where theyve had u s opens its a great experience definitely playing out here is different than playing most courses a different kind of experience
1802215 its the heartbeat that pumps life into our facility hosting the u s amateur reminds us of the fundamental value as an ambassador of golf as a lifelong game
1802216 we might have to back off of the firm and fast a little bit
1802217 its hot its humid its sticky its wet theyre all going to play the same golf course and it isnt going to be like the golf courses weve all seen in the u s open a little bit softer a little bit slower but it will be the same on monday as it would be on sunday that is one thing that all the competitors can expect consistency
1802218 to try and win a major and to earn a lot of points for the ryder cup
1802219 im here to try to win try to play my best and hope thats good enough at the end of the week
1802220 but its much longer than in 2004 and the rough is thicker
1802221 to try and win a major and to earn a lot of points for the ryder cup
1802222 im here to try to win try to play my best and hope thats good enough at the end of the week
1802223 but its much longer than in 2004 and the rough is thicker
1802224 its an opportunity for a lot of guys you look at guys who have not won majors who are my age or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
1802225 if you look at the world rankings from fifth to 20th theres a lot of guys very bunched and playing very good golf there are so many guys that can win this week
1802226 ive had quite a few second places quite a few thirds and top fives so quite a few chances
1802227 but i think tiger a lot of times has just been way better
1802228 i remember in 2000 finishing second three times and twice to him in majors
1802229 i feel ive still got quite a few years left so ive got to keep pushing away
1802230 i get criticized in south africa a lot more than i get over here its something that ive had to live with for a while if tiger woods wasnt around i probably would have won a couple more majors but i dont feel like im done yet
1802231 ive got a very good feel about the golf course
1802232 my swing is in pretty good shape and i feel excited about this week i feel like i have a reasonably good chance at making a good showing and hopefully i have a chance on sunday
1802233 i have said many times that i cannot imagine a better place to play or to coach than the university of kansas
1802234 my family and i look forward to being part of the lawrence community for many years to come
1802235 he has done a tremendous job leading the kansas mens basketball program both on and off the court
1802236 theres no one id rather have at the helm of the kansas program
1802237 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1802238 these results were known ages ago but they decided to release them just before the olympic games
1802239 there is a feeling that they officials did it especially to create unpleasantness for us
1802240 no one is excusing the athletes who broke the wada world anti doping agency code
1802241 there has to be some kind of weapon that will frighten those who dont have enough dignity to stop and for whom material profit is more powerful than moral gain
1802242 this is a big week because right now my season with just a couple wins is just okay
1802243 but if i were able to come through on sunday and win the last major it could turn it into something special
1802244 i feel great off the tee and the area that im spending most of my time working on is my short game
1802245 i feel like around these greens putting is going to be a big part of it and so will chipping
1802246 im trying to spend most of my time working on my short game
1802247 i felt like i hit the ball well all day
1802248 it was just three or four holes there in the end i hit good shots they just didnt go in
1802249 me manda una carta de amor y yo voy a buscarlo
1802250 the one thing i do know is that these guys are competitors both of them they go out theyre going to get after each other in this kicking competition
1802251 he threw a pretty good bullpen the other day and those guys were fresh in the pen so we decided it would be better to give him another day
1802252 matos and romo have done a good job it was more of a case that yabu was ready to come off the dl and sadlers been throwing very well

1802278 i am so tickled by getting to write this post i can barely actually write it
1802279 well honey e mail them and tell them so you can find the address on their website
1802280 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
1802281 we have a lot to learn from their success too
1802282 they infinity ward did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1802283 its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic
1802284 the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from

1802287 the company must have the ability and be willing to grow bacillus anthracis sterne strain at 1500 litre quantities
1802288 it raises a serious question over how the us is going to demonstrate its compliance with obligations under the biological weapons convention if it brings these tanks online
1802289 if one can grow the sterne strain in these units one could also grow the ames strain which is quite lethal
1802290 i can definitely see them testing biological weapons delivery systems for threat assessment
1802291 what would happen to the biological weapons convention if other countries followed suit and built large biological production facilities at secretive military bases known for weapons testing
1802292 it was fairly clear that the likelihood of mines being located in the remaining area was minimal
1802293 yet a judgement to lay this land aside had not been considered by any of the managers of the programme
1802294 how do you ensure that the dose doesnt cross the threshold for permanent damage
1802295 what happens if someone in a crowd is unable for whatever reason to move away from the beam does the weapon cut out to prevent overexposure
1802296 the whole area of our most recent excavation was a war zone
1802297 this was clearly no minor skirmish this was shock and awe in the fourth millennium bc
1802298 it is likely that the southerners played a role in the destruction of this city
1802299 the military needs to hold up on this conversion to tungsten alloy weapons until more is known
1802300 i am deeply concerned about the ethical aspects of this research
1802301 even if the use of temporary severe pain can be justified as a restraining measure which i do not believe it can the long term physical and psychological effects are unknown
1802302 sensory consequences of electromagnetic pulses emitted by laser induced plasmas
1802303 i dont have anything interesting to convey i was just providing some background for the group
1802304 the focus will now be with the defense department and its research into earth penetrating technology using conventional weaponry the nnsa indicated that this research should evolve around more conventional weapons rather than tactical nuclear devices
1802305 i have long cautioned against an rnep weapon and i am relieved that the administration has abandoned this irresponsible and dangerous path
1802306 since their first days in office the bush administration has appeared intent on finding new uses for existing nuclear weapons and designing new nuclear weapons whether the military had any use for them or not and regardless of the grave international ramifications
1802307 he insists that assurance must be made that no bullets hit him in the face
1802308 two weeks before president mckinley was killed i offered a waistcoat to him

1802310 the military has been using two frequencies from day one of gps this will be first time that we are adding a second frequency for civilian users
1802311 it makes it difficult to pursue the things space is uniquely suited for such as communications navigation and exploration
1802312 since 2001 the pentagon has clearly laid out its intentions to carry out war in space
1802313 my one ray of hope is that its going to be hilariously expensive
1802314 the bcpd lab routinely reported that gunshot residue collected from a subjects hands most probably arose from proximity to a discharging firearm despite the fact that comparable levels of gunshot residue were detected in the laboratorys contamination studies
1802315 none of what we do can establish if anybody discharged a firearm
1802316 i dont think its a very valuable technique to begin with its great chemistry its great microscopy the question is how did the particle get there
1802317 if i was going to go out and look for gunshot residue police stations are the places id look
1802318 because the possibility of secondary transfer exists at least three unique particles must be detected in order to report the subject object surface as having been in an environment of gunshot primer residue
1802319 will make recommendations to the scientific community regarding accepting conducting and interpreting gsr exams
1802320 i think its important as part of the investigative phase
1802321 there are people who are going to be a bit more shall we say enthusiastic thats where youre going to run into trouble
1802322 visually stunning and thematically arresting daft punks widescreen debut is a beautiful sun blushed nugget of cinema
1802323 this is the first vinyl release for the acclaimed solo debut from bradford cox to make the 4 sides of the album complete there are six new songs added rest assured these are not mere leftovers from the mixing of the album in fact most of them were recorded after the album had already been completed
1802324 third album by the critically acclaimed group expands on their signature multi lingual sound while paying respect to their international roots and the city where they got their start
1802325 ten years of clinic flipsides are joyously addled but have consistently given a reason to listen beyond the a sides covering acid punk to damaged hoedowns and any stops in between
1802326 fate is the record dr dog were destined to make a timeless yet contemporary distillation of the bands open armed big hearted sound taken to new heights of craft and creativity inventive magnificently realized and absolutely irresistible
1802327 the vocals sound less human than ever before the bass lines are more mangled keyboards spiral and squeal out of control electronic pings and stabs invade the melodies the lyrical anxiety and disdain of previous albums pervades on every song
1802328 this seven song mini album features guest appearances by levon helm michael hurley and tara jane oneil and includes covers of songs by john martyn dolly parton and annie briggs
1802329 randy newmans first studio album of all new material in nearly a decade is by turns hilarious poignant and scathingly satirical harps and angels often has an easy going crescent city feel with newman on piano fronting a small combo and revealing his serious love and study of the new orleans piano tradition
1802330 preteen weaponry reminds oneida of what a live performance might sound like
1802331 the cd is one of the best introductions to their work weve ever seen nearly 3 albums worth of music from the legendary tamba trio one of the grooviest groups in the 60s bossa years in brazil the trio are quite unique in that they not only play upbeat bossa rhythms but also harmonize along with their grooves in a soaringly sublime quality that really electrifies the tunes

1802346 thats just the way im built thats just the way i play football
1802347 early in camp ive got to tone down the speed a little bit sometimes i get ahead of my blockers get to a hole before its there ive got to gear it down every now and then but thats a good thing
1802348 when i come running through a hole i dont want to be thinking about that i want to be thinking about that play
1802349 so that was a good sign and he had a great practice
1802350 hes been very conscientious about how hes looked and what hes doing
1802351 for a guy whos been in this league for 11 years thats a quality that you always want hes always asking did i make the right cut what did i do here what could i have done better there you like having guys like that
1802352 im not worried so much about what i do individually as long as i do positive things for this team all the little things the big stuff will come
1802353 we need him his experience and his understanding of the game
1802354 i dont know if hes going to run away from a lot of people but hes going to get you the yards that he needs to get whatever yards are there hes going to get them
1802355 looks like hes getting ready for a big one and i think all of us know we need a big one out of him
1802356 we are not satisfied with the score it couldve been a better result for us
1802357 germany dominated in the first half and played much better than brazil
1802358 but in the second we were able to impose our style and created more scoring chances
1802359 i think it was a good game for our team
1802360 the defense was perfect we did quite well covering marta
1802361 overall were a very strong physical team thats kind of our style
1802362 them being small they probably got the worst of it
1802363 the goal was big for us its always frustrating when your pressuring the ball and it doesnt go into the net
1802364 i think some people look at it and are a little nervous but i like the young attitude we have
1802365 but going into the end of the year willie parker probably would have won the rushing title if it wouldnt have been for that injury to me i dont see it being a big issue
1802366 you lose a potential hall of fame lineman theres always going to be questions
1802367 chris needs to set the tone and let people recognize who he is and not try to worry about replacing faneca
1802368 z sat back and kind of let us do our own thing last year
1802369 this year everybody is really paying attention and trying to do that because you cant have combat between two different styles
1802370 theres definitely a sense of urgency around the locker room as far as giving up sacks
1802371 i think theres a little different chemistry from what i understand kendall and marvel kind of stepped up as leaders and i think everybodys on board
1802372 its a damn shame thats all there is to it
1802373 we know were missing out on a quality experience for the student athletes but its too big a load to bear
1802374 all the benefits inherent with the conference situation were not enough for us to forget about the travel costs
1802375 there is no room for divorce we cant get into priuses or onto buses and solve our problems
1802376 airlines dont have marketing people now so were dealing with some 800 number or getting some group desk
1802377 you hope to get a deal but its something that is never going away
1802378 we have coaches online just about every day trying to book flights at reasonable rates and theyre nowhere close to where they were before
1802379 its a guessing game you dont know whether to lock in a rate you just hope you get lucky
1802380 in sports where you wish to be competitive youre still going to have to find a way to do it
1802381 theres going to be more pressure on selling tickets more pressure on fundraising
1802382 i really want to go to tennessee they play up and down and they play at a pace that i like to play at
1802383 i guess i gotta just keep playing harder in order to pick up an offer from tennessee we talk sometimes hopefully i can get that offer
1802384 ive thought about waiting since im going up there i might wait until the spring before committing
1802385 everyone is on the same level up there its going to be good for me playing there
1802386 i feel like im very competitive i want it more than anybody thats my mindset
1802387 i think that comes from how i live and where i come from
1802388 my ginormity is making it harder than ever to get around its not just my belly last saturday i bought a queen latifah brand bra 40ddd the largest they sell
1802389 indeed my hosts were so sweet lots of cupcakes because as you may know i cooked cupcakes weekly and ate cupcakes three times a day the month i got pregnant and they specially made me french fries which i have eaten nearly everyday of this pregnancy to starve off nauseousness with a side of ranch of course one of the hosts is the nice internet woman that invited me out the night that i was so upset from ivf delay number 5 weve become fast friends she gets it
1802390 my first musical hero was tom jones and later i was into british rock led zeppelin that sort of thing
1802391 im really into martial arts and jazz and i make sure my son listens to everything
1802392 i borrowed some cds from my father i was impressed
1802393 at one point in the 60s we were so popular they were lined up five abreast around the block wed play koseinenkin hall in shinjuku three times in one day
1802394 we were the opening act for bobby vee and a girl named joanne campbell
1802395 she was in a movie at that time a twist movie with joey dee and the starlighters and she was popular in japan because of the movie she was the headliner
1802396 and bob used to play with the whammy bar and once in a while instead of a note hed hit a chord and give it a little vibrato
1802397 in 1964 we returned to japan and 6 000 people met us at the airport
1802398 in those two years they had been playing our records you couldnt go anywhere without hearing the ventures coffee shops radio even outdoor loudspeakers
1802399 the pta or their equivalent here tried to ban us
1802400 what they had then were things like trios los panchos all acoustic guitars that was the japanese idea of a small instrumental group
1802401 he said i could put you in a ballpark but you should be in a more intimate setting so he had us play three shows a day at places that held about 3 000
1802402 just japanese style inns also we toured in the summer and the venues had no air conditioning theyd place a block of ice on a table and put a fan behind it
1802403 the girls who were serving us their jaws just dropped to the floor
1802404 and in those days it took six hours to get somewhere that today would only take 90 minutes he would bring his guitar and sit with nokie the whole time asking him how to do this and how to do that
1802405 we got the feel for enka japanese folk ballads when we first got here
1802406 so we started writing in that vein but just a little bit away from it then the girls who recorded our melodies put japanese words to them
1802407 and when we tell them we wrote kyoto no koi and futari no ginza they say really they know the songs but they dont know we wrote them
1802408 one of the characteristics of our early songs was that muffled rhythm within a minor key and if you take that sound and place it in a different context like traditional japanese music played on a shamisen it fits theres also that plucky quality and the phrasing is similar too
1802409 so when i read that the ventures are the pioneers of surf music i go what we were never a surf group
1802410 i think the only person in the band who has ever surfed is me
1802411 billy joel was backstage at the hall of fame ceremony
1802412 and he told me that one of the very first songs he learned
1802413 one of them comes up to me and says are you the ventures
1802414 we want you to take your best pregnant belly photos from little baby bumps to big pregnant bellies and enter them into our baby bump contest while youre there share and comment on other peoples pregnant belly photos too
1802415 from now on im only going to cry over something worth crying over
1802416 hes a jerk and i dont care about him anymore now on with life
1802417 he knew he was driving and that he would get in trouble for it
1802418 they the state are desperate to convict someone in this tragedy the woman they have had locked up for the past half year will do just fine
1802419 the fact that she had to be extricated is the telling tale
1802420 it looks like its going to be new york or tampa bay were waiting to find out and we could learn in the next hour or so
1802421 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1802422 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1802423 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1802424 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1802425 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1802426 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1802427 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1802428 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1802429 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1802430 en aquellos tiempos los de primera eran las calles ju rez allende y corregidora y se distingu an por los muebles aqu en las orillas no ten amos de estos silloncitos eran sillones de madera entonces all hab a puros espejos m quinas el ctricas y aparte la gente los mejores clientes eran en el centro los de centavos la tarifa de nosotros era 90 centavos la rasurada y 1 20 el pelo ah en el centro se cobraban 2 50
1802431 uno tiene que buscar por el pelo c mo hacerle para que quede presentable c mo hacer que se vea bien el cliente casta as redondas casta as cuadradas abultado medio abultado los pachucos quer an abultado con media cola ya no los hago porque la gente ya no los pide nosotros no ten amos modelo el cliente dec a yo lo quiero as y nosotros sab amos c mo ve amos su tipo de pelo
1802432 bueno yo fui ch charo o sea aprend a trapear bolear limpiar espejos pues ah empieza uno a ver y se va uno ense ando luego el maestro ya le da a uno oportunidad de empezar a pelar a gente en aquel tiempo hab a unos que estaban medios tocados entonces eran nuestros maniqu s y ah empezaba uno a trabajar hasta que se hac a uno peluquero empec ya como oficial como a los 16 y ahorita tengo como 54 a os en esto
1802433 esas rayas tienen su significado el caramelo cuando a m me toc estar de aprendiz yo ya no lo vi pero el maistro nos dec a que los peluqueros anteriormente ten an sanguijuelas y se pegaban en las v rices para sacar la sangre y tambi n sacaban muelas entonces ese era el rojo que viene siendo la sangre el blanco significaba la limpieza porque ten a que tener puros peinadores blancos y bata blanca y el azul significa la confianza porque le tienen que tener confianza al peluquero porque imag nese con esa navaja entonces ese era el significado y adem s donde lo ve a uno ya sab a que ah era peluquer a
1802434 esto es lo que ya no le hacen a uno en una est tica no es lo mismo ni los servicios son los mismos hay mucha diferencia entre un estilista y un peluquero nosotros arreglamos barbas bigotes y los estilistas no creo que le entren incluso donde trabaj bamos nos daban 20 25 minutos por cliente ahora en 10 minutos ya ya est un estilista ya acaba ahorita ya no afilamos navajas porque nos dijeron que pura desechable por lo del sida pero antes ten a uno que afilar navajas sus tijeras ahora ya no creo que lo hagan
1802435 m s o menos ha de tener como unos 25 a os lo que pas fue esto no exist an las unisex ni las est ticas las peluquer as de primera ten an tambi n sala de belleza que es a donde iban las se oras yo me acuerdo de la se ora evangelina esa era la de categor a y qui n sabe si haya ense ado gente no s si fue la se ora evangelina la que empez a sacar su academia o si fue de los gay empez a salir estilista y estilista y nos invadieron y se pusieron escuelas donde dan mec nica estilista y cocina y todo eso pero yo creo que lo m s esencial es que se ense en practicando

1802439 no fim das contas queremos que o motorista tenha o controle final
1802440 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth about the primaries
1802441 if mccain and obama are serious about moving beyond partisan gridlock
1802442 yeah right theres a ton of fruit and flowers books out there what makes you and your book so different
1802443 make a blog related wish on your blog sharing with all of the world well some of the world on the other hand it might not but theres always next week
1802444 mccain has a serious problem with evangelicals and jindals conservative credentials will help shore up that weakness despite jindals conservative views he does not seem to be demonized by the left and in a more long term sense a jindal pick could be an important step in rebranding the party and increasing the tent the one negative is that jindal would neutralize any kind of attack on obamas experience but mccain hasnt been taking that route anyways
1802445 he does do two extremely significant things 1 he beats obamas message of change with a bludgeon how can you call yourself the ticket of change when the other party is running a republican and independent picking lieberman would make mccain much more competitive with independent voters 2 lieberman is not going to be the next leader of the republican party picking lieberman gives the republicans four years to find the future leader of the party and hopefully for their sake turn around their losses in the senate and house
1802446 mccain desperately needs a candidate who will bring buzz and a sense of excitement to his campaign basically anyone other than a middle aged male wasp
1802447 pawlenty adds some youth to the campaign and some all important domestic abilities the governor of a state shows that mccain cares about domestic issues and wants someone with executive experience on board
1802448 former budget director rob portman in an obvious effort to shore up his economic credentials with conservatives portman is from ohio a key battleground state and may not turn off moderates portman will essentially become the point person for mccains economic plan allowing the senator to focus on his biggest strength national security
1802449 romney is strong in two key areas where mccain is weak the economy and fundraising
1802450 because obama needs to look like he respects experience he needs the foreign policy chops and he needs someone familiar to the american working class bidens a great debater and has the air of wisdom that comes from a guy who doesnt have to carefully measure his words because he knows that you know what hes really all about biden will also help obama take pa
1802451 the only criticism that mccain seems to make of obama that actually sticks in the media is criticism on the security front wesley clark four star general and supreme allied commander during the balkan war takes away this line of attack before he even opens his mouth aside from that hes popular in the south is well respected elsewhere for his service and commanded a war without a single american casualty an important distinction given the iraq mess his advice would be essential seeing that iraq and afghanistan are dealt with properly in over the next four years hes a catholic which was a group obama had trouble winning over in the primaries hes also 64 which will appeal to older voters another group obama has had trouble with quite simply all the pieces fit
1802452 hagel is a vietnam war veteran a lifelong republican and a member of the senate foreign relations committee who previously worked as political organizer for ronald reagan and then as his 2 political appointee at the veterans administration so his selection would not only be an unprecedented bi partisan gesture but would also bring the military and foreign policy credentials obama lacks to the ticket hagel left government service in 1982 and became a multi millionaire business entrepreneur and ceo before he returned to government as a us senator in 1996 thus he also possesses the business experience and economic credentials that both obama and his opponent john mccain lack hagel was also an early critic and vocal opponent of the iraq war and obama would find huge support for this among independent and republican voters particularly in midwestern states
1802453 senator mccaskill has largely been an effective and articulate surrogate for obama and she hails from a red state she also connects well with women and working class voters and is perceived as a moderate the obvious liability is that she has even less national experience than obama having been elected to her 1st term in 2006 however she does have political experience in missouri as state auditor which dovetails nicely with cleaning up washington
1802454 gov richardson has everything sen obama needs to complete his candidacy experience gov of nm check foreign policy un ambassador check not jaded by being part of the washington machine hasnt been in dc since the clinton administration check appeal to a very imp ortant voting bloc hispanic heritage check help with purple states gov of nm proximity and hispanic voting strength in nv check
1802455 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1802456 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1802457 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1802458 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1802459 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1802460 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1802461 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1802462 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1802463 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
1802464 i said sure what can come of such a case
1802465 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
1802466 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
1802467 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
1802468 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
1802469 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
1802470 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
1802471 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
1802472 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
1802473 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
1802474 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1802475 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1802476 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1802477 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1802478 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1802479 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1802480 that facility could have taken care of me any day
1802481 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
1802482 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
1802483 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
1802484 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1802485 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
1802486 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
1802487 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
1802488 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
1802489 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
1802490 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
1802491 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
1802492 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
1802493 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
1802494 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
1802495 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
1802496 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
1802497 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
1802498 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
1802499 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
1802500 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
1802501 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
1802502 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
1802503 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
1802504 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
1802505 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
1802506 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
1802507 we had thousands more signatures than we needed in kansas city
1802508 the missile footage has just been grafted onto the front and it looks like a surface to surface missile to me
1802509 this seems more likely than something hitting it in the air
1802510 in the past the problem with lasers of this type has been that they often permanently blind human targets
1802511 this new wave of low intensity laser weapons do not have a permanently damaging effect apparently
1802512 they already use bright white lights at vehicle checkpoints in iraq to dazzle drivers who are approaching too fast
1802513 internal force sensors detect the ground variations and compensate for them
1802514 and bigdogs active balance allows it to maintain stability when we disturb it
1802515 they seem to have done a good job with adaptive dynamics and fast reflexes to deal with terrain variation and disturbances
1802516 it certainly looks very impressive fast moving highly reactive autonomous both in power and possible intelligence and looking fairly robust i have seen none that would be better but there must always be a certain caution from videos
1802517 the truth is that we withheld crucial information skewed other information and colluded with the contractors and the programme officials to put a positive spin on the results of a test that was a failure
1802518 the biggest problem was making the device non lethal at minimum range yet effective at maximum range
1802519 without thorough independent testing we cannot ascertain their usefulness effectiveness or safety
1802520 the legislative aide to illinois governor rod blagojevich suggested in a 2003 e mail he could win a senators vote if the administration hired the lawmakers secretary
1802521 the first man portable heat compliance weapon of its kind
1802522 the non lethal weapons community is always complaining about bad treatment in the media but without more transparency about what is being developed and what the effects on people are suspicion is bound to be created
1802523 until these systems have proven to be safer than existing systems baton rounds tasers tear gas there is little likelihood of them being deployed operationally
1802524 i wasnt planning to make heaps of money out of this room
1802525 these guys come in and they dont want sex they come in for company but no one gives a bugger about that because the law says we cant do it

1802569 la inflaci n de julio va a ser alta porque en la primera quincena fue alta y porque persisten las presiones en los precios agropecuarios y de los combustibles

1802584 we believe there is the possibility that this has been caused by global warming
1802585 particularly unusual and unstable because cold air from the north is likely to rise to the upper levels of the atmosphere

1802589 find just a small group of people and meet and talk about our beliefs and struggles and study the bible and connect on a real level and let that be church
1802590 weve taught kids and youth to expect to be entertained and now we are in a vicious cycle on how to up the quotient and keep their attention this is magnified and made even more ugly in a church setting when we try to find a way to insert the gospel into this machine of age segregation

1802607 a market require is there however there are much of mortgage initiation issues that have to be dealt using loaner are non attend offer this unless its the profitable product
1802608 by owning a previous automatic rate cut mortgages a condition was that it never estimated out training finance the mortgages
1802609 ours is built upon a rate reducing new of a mortgage and the instrument that funds the mortgage when a rate of interest clicks down on a mortgage the interest will too push button down on the funding instrument
1802610 a total of refinance activity goes higher while rates fall amp goes down when rates rise
1802611 what the ratch mortgage does is mimic that in a extra effective fashion whenever rates begin running down it would last down

1802614 when you attack jews amp americans in the media and physically killing them you almost never get condemned for your actions

1802616 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

1802618 evita was like the springtime for hitler song in the producers but not like joke like for real
1802619 it appears to be a nationwide network that attracts right wing extremists as well as law and order types and people connected to public safety such as firefighters police auxiliaries retired police and military officers and even their family members
1802620 i doubt it could exist without some people in positions of power looking the other way
1802621 this is torture thats happening right here in american cities and towns
1802622 but its like pre world war ii germany people refuse to believe that such abuses could happen in a civilized society but it is happening and im convinced that local and federal authorities not only have knowledge of this extra legal targeting but are providing funding and direction
1802623 i know the fbi knows about it because ive been down there several times over the past two years to report it
1802624 im not saying they know of the worst abuses such as using microwaves on targeted persons to degrade their health and make it impossible for them to earn a living
1802625 you havent done anything wrong so they cant charge you with a crime so they attempt to make it look like youre crazy thats how they marginalize people who dont fit in with their world view
1802626 we havent had these kind of widespread financial woes for sixty years
1802627 you have to wonder if these rogue programs of personal destruction werent a blueprint for an ideologically motivated purge
1802628 the issue of state supported vigilantism and extra legal control represents an assault on our judicial system that makes watergate look like the third rate burglary that it started out to be
1802629 since government agencies appear to be involved in funding these programs its up to congress to investigate to use its powers of oversight to ensure that democracy and the rule of law prevails and not the law of the jungle
1802630 mr chertoff are you aware that many americans believe they have been the victims of so called community or gang stalking possibly perpetrated by persons equipped and trained by federally funded volunteer programs under your charge have you heard of such reports and are you investigating to ensure that these programs and their resources are not being misused
1802631 i am not afraid of you and i will beat your a
1802632 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1802633 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

1802641 what hath god wrought the transformation of america 1815 1848
1802642 theyre probably spending more on the advertising than they are on the research
1802643 do the american people want to elect the worlds biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an american hero
1802644 just because a car looks like a ferrari doesnt mean it will run like one mccain has to get voters to look under the hood and if he can i think theyll see they are being sold a kit car with a vw engine
1802645 they need to have a stronger concentration of effort and focus on this issue and several subsequent issues to win a majority of the vote
1802646 hopefully this is the start of an aggressive issues debate through election day
1802647 every obama ad since his announcement has fit nicely into a theme an argument mccain ads are just catch as catch can one wild swing at obama after another their increasing bitterness reflects a campaign that is more about some sort of therapeutic frustration venting for the staff than any coherent strategy to elect mccain its unprofessional to the core
1802648 it seems like they are talking to the press pack not voters
1802649 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas
1802650 lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset two golden hours each set with 60 diamond minutes no reward is offered for they are gone forever
1802651 in washington proximity to power is power and on the february day solis doyle was replaced she experienced one of the more rapid and extraordinary free falls in american politics
1802652 she said we are moving on and we cannot waste time with the what ifs
1802653 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1802654 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1802655 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1802656 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1802657 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1802658 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1802659 if the surge has worked amp political progress has been made why are we still there posted by bsimon july 30 2008 4 19 pm fair enough question but not cognizent of history answer we never leave we are still in germany japan bosnia turkey
1802660 only one problem with your view simple simon the facts troops have started to come home political progress has been made
1802661 i was just kidding barry i really do like you but i just cant support anyone whod hire me
1802662 i guess in simple simons world the effort in iraq has been to no effect whatsoever pretty much the same as last year
1802663 whatever you think of mccain hes not in it for the glory
1802664 the last month the un verified that 15 of 18 benchmarks were met
1802665 perhaps my comments are colored by my sense that obama is a controlling egomaniac who has bedazzled frustrated and easily beguiled liberal progressives with his lofty but insubstantial rhetoric and his embrace of the personality cult as strategy
1802666 the biggest challenge ahead of us is the provincial elections law
1802667 the systems structured so that the constitution will not develop significant changes
1802668 its hard for the central government to get out of baghdad and out of the green zone and move things ahead
1802669 there is still much important work ahead for the people of iraq and their government
1802670 nevertheless todays legislative actions reflect a significant commitment to address important issues and find political bases on which to move forward
1802671 realistically they can figure out that the chances we would pull the plug and leave is just about zero
1802672 ddawd you seem to be the typical obama supporter avoiding any and all facts that are contrary to your kumbaya world view the last month the un verified that 15 of 18 benchmarks were met but perhaps you know better sitting at your desk
1802673 one of these things is not like the other one of these things is going to win
1802674 his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
1802675 left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
1802676 i have always loved longitude i love latitude its in the stars but longitude its about time time and clocks and all the rest of that have always been a fascination for me
1802677 answer it did and i always said it would except when i didnt which was mostly my voters dont care about facts i am the hannah montana candidate cue the lights and special effects roll the teleprompter
1802678 today milbank cut out the first part of an obama quote to trash him
1802679 ok we all know you loathe the clintons and were just trying to be clever in your own special way but lets get real here
1802680 unlike his partys presumptive nominee ohanlon has admitted publicly and repeatedly that his expert opinions on the surges inevitable failure turned out to be spectacularly wrong why his candidate cant do the same is more than a mystery it is deeply troubling
1802681 words do matter words challenge us to reach higher words are a catalyst for change and words motivate us to chase our dreams
1802682 she probably hid from bubba because she didnt want the intern treatment
1802683 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders would react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact perhaps but he has the burden of explanation does he elide contradictions claim theyre irrelevant and generally spin in his interview with nbcs brian williams he suggested that hed always said the surge would decrease violence in iraq thats not just spin its not true
1802684 to say youre going to get out on a certain schedule regardless of what the iraqis do regardless of what our enemies do regardless of what is happening on the ground is the height of absurdity im not going to go to the next level of invective and say he shouldnt be president ill leave that to someone else
1802685 there has been a long list it seems to be getting shorter
1802686 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1802687 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1802688 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1802689 why is feingold not mentioned for a possible obama vp pick
1802690 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1802691 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

1802699 liberal democrat solution to any problem raise taxes and spend more
1802700 theyre probably spending more on the advertising than they are on the research
1802701 rewarding effective teachers with pay increases is an incentive to keep effective teachers
1802702 if i dont get at least a 5 pay raise im outta here
1802703 please explain exactly how altering the margins of some teachers pay is going to magically substantially change the dynamics of the students who are flunking
1802704 this approach taking public dollars away from public schools and diverting them to private schools is exactly what has made our college and university system the best in the world with the threat and promise of competition
1802705 side benefit taking his pants off will increase airflow to his brain
1802706 i thought your guy was about change yet it seems he will not change anything about the public school system
1802707 well i think we should explore the possibilities of off shore drilling
1802708 throw the environment out the window at 4 a gallon and get on the oil company lobby gravy train
1802709 instead he takes his wealth and directs it to his kids only in essence throwing up his hands and abandoning the system
1802710 ie the surge was a failure and made things worse and now this
1802711 gen casey surge bought time but gains are fragile and reversible
1802712 why do his own girls go to private school has he thrown up his hands and walked away from chicago public schools
1802713 how could he turn to this man for useful advice
1802714 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
1802715 obamas solution to americas energy crisis is inflating tires maybe hes been out of the country too long
1802716 interesting that the folks i have spoken with inside the o campaign know and understand that problem
1802717 if he doesnt choose hillary then obama proves to be an idiot
1802718 barack obamas vice presidential vetting process has moved into a new stage in which a larger than previously reported group of candidates is being exposed to a
1802719 the punditry has been chasing its collective tail and that we are likely to be surprised when the details of the process and the veep choice itself emerge
1802720 virginia has an election in 2009 and the sitting governor cant be re elected

1802737 if you doubt you can accomplish something then you cant accomplish it you have to have confidence in your ability and then be tough enough to follow through
1802738 our office has been flooded today with calls and emails from supporters urging the senator to press on the message from them is clear alaska needs ted stevens in the u s senate
1802739 the indictment of senator ted stevens is a sad day for alaska and for the senator after his 40 years of service to our state
1802740 the people of alaska are resilient and strong i have great faith in our state and our people and we will continue to move forward

1802749 i just dont like him for the things hes done he seems to be fighting the abortion issue more than anything else
1802750 representatives from nomura research institute are understood to be coming to queensland next month to discuss possible collaborative water research

1802761 on my journey the vast majority of people i met did not grow up in the churches they currently attend
1802762 all were on a spiritual quest to do that which god called them to do a mission that could only be accomplished in a community of diverse sorts a band of contemporary pilgrims on a quest to find home

1802773 curiosamente el subdesarrollo es un gran obst culo para luchar contra el subdesarrollo
1802774 es un hecho que el pa s est progresando y eso es muy positivo y creo que hay que reconocerlo
1802775 ese crecimiento hay que procurar que llegue de una manera m s homog nea al conjunto del pa s y sobre todo a los sectores que est n muy marginados donde hay todav a mucha frustraci n porque muchos peruanos sienten que los beneficios de este crecimiento no les llega
1802776 estamos cuadrando una reuni n en la casa blanca para tratar el tema tps el presidente george w

1802779 no voy a permitir que le roben la paz interna a frida sof a que le roben el derecho de ser una persona normal
1802780 es muy triste ver el morbo ver c mo los buitres llegan a la herida y te est n carcomiendo y que la gente sea capaz de juzgar de poder hacer pedazos a una personita que est comenzando a vivir a una jovencita que tiene todo el derecho a vivir

1802784 este es un estado de derecho en el que se respetan los derechos de los ciudadanos y si alguna persona se quiere expresar dentro del marco del respeto ante las instituciones por supuesto tienen todo el derecho a expresar su opini n
1802785 para este momento a diferencia de otros a os el movimiento de inscripciones es m s grande hoy est n registradas 54 organizaciones con fines pol ticos nacionales para postular y un total 486 organizaciones entre nacionales y regionales
1802786 un 87 por ciento de las organizaciones nacionales y regionales inscritas est n autorizadas para postular y de los grupos de electores el 100 por ciento est autorizado para postular esto es un excelente n mero con respecto a otras oportunidades
1802787 este es un movimiento que lo podemos calificar de exitoso y optimista porque a 24 horas de haber iniciado el lapso de postulaciones es un gran porcentaje el que se ha postulado o al menos manifestado el inter s de postulaci n
1802788 el lapso vence el 12 de agosto a las 12 de la noche el llamado es para no dejar para ltimo minuto las postulaciones

1802798 nosotros con seriedad y sin ning n tipo de llamado a la violencia instamos a todo el pa s a que esta ley tiene que ser desaplicada y desconocida por el propio pueblo venezolano
1802799 este decreto se refiere a que el gobierno puede meterse cuando le de la gana expropiar intervenir el comercio de cualquier persona y quitarle sus bienes y destruir el local de cualquier trabajador en un momento dado por razones pol ticas

1802812 saya sekarang lebih banyak tinggal di amerika tapi masih sering mengunjungi indonesia
1802813 persaingan mendapatkan posisi sebagai profesor di amerika memang sangat ketat setiap satu lowongan lebih dari 350 orang yang mendaftar
1802814 ayah saya seorang pekerja keras saya juga terbiasa melakukannya sejak muda hingga menjadi profesor seperti sekarang
1802815 bimbingan keluarga orang tua guru dan sekolah itu penting tapi yang lebih penting adalah usaha kita
1802816 yang terpenting lakukan hal yang paling kamu sukai sehingga kamu pasti berhasil di dalamnya tentu saja ditambah dengan usaha yang keras
1802817 saya tidak punya rencana sejauh itu toh 20 tahun lagi kita adalah citizen of the world orang akan bebas tinggal di mana pun
1802818 semua kenangan tetang masa kecil dan orang tua saya ada di sini saya tentu tidak bisa melupakan indonesia
1802819 untuk mendapatkan gelar tersebut kan susah butuh banyak biaya untuk riset dan penelitian
1802820 di amerika banyak yang mau memberikan bantuan dana untuk pendidikan dan saya bisa mencarikannya dengan mudah
1802821 sejak kecil saya ingin jadi pendidik di bidang sains dan engineering sayangnya posisi ini di indonesia kurang dihargai
1802822 inilah yang menjadikan mutu pendidikan kita rendah guru guru dengan gaji dan fasilitas pas pasan tentunya tidak bisa memberikan pelayanan optimal karena harus mencari tambahan sampingan
1802823 jika ada profesor yang kembali ke indonesia ditawari jadi dosen atau anggota dewan maka jawabannya pasti yang terakhir its the reality
1802824 jika ada satu saja universitas di indonesia yang setara dengan di as maka anak anak kita yang pandai tidak akan lari ke luar negeri mereka akan memilih kuliah di negaranya sendiri
1802825 talk to me in 50 years when you really have done something you think youre ahead but youre really behind dont classify yourself as someone who has done well for their race but someone who has to catch up on years and years of opression
1802826 my feeling is that my role in the presidential election this time is to remain one of the coordinators i wont say any more in detail but i firmly believe that a presidential election involving more than one candidate will be held
1802827 it was impossible to predict such a concentrated heavy rain lashing the area

1802832 the china market represents a large opportunity for most of our businesses

1802839 in essence the mccain charge is this obama cares so little for the welfare of wounded american soldiers that he canceled the visit when he was informed he could not bring reporters and television cameras to document it but there is no evidence that obama ever planned to bring anyone to the hospital other than a single military adviser whose status as a campaign staffer sparked last minute concern among pentagon officials that the visit would be an improper political event the obama campaign has cited those concerns as the reason for canceling obamas visit
1802840 the cancellation provided one of the few sour notes in an overseas trip that otherwise seemed to be well orchestrated it offered an opening on a subject military affairs that the mccain campaign believes mr obama is vulnerable on
1802841 he decided not to put the troops in that position
1802842 barack hussein obama should have gone to visit our wounded troops in our us military hospital in germany
1802843 no matter who went with obama to visit the troops it would have been a political trip nothing more nothing less
1802844 they did not like being told by senator obama that if bush left the white house they would quit hunting and quit going to church and they certainly did not like senator obamas failure to fight for his right to visit the troops in germany cant he stand up to the pentagon
1802845 thats completely untrue and i think honestly they know its untrue
1802846 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you cant fool all of the people all of the time
1802847 wait he did do drugs its a fact coke and weed
1802848 but it turns out that the pentagon did in fact tell obama that in this case it was not only
1802849 we have longstanding department of defense policy in regards to political campaigns and elections
1802850 we informed the obama staff that he was more than welcome to visit as senator obama with senate staff however he could not conduct the visit with campaign staff
1802851 its unclear how obama could have made the visit at all given the pentagons directives no senate staff was on the trip and the obama camp says they received the pentagons directives on wednesday after they were already abroad
1802852 john mccain and his campaign have been doing their darndest to keep the story alive
1802853 bho failed to visit hospitalized troops to go to gym
1802854 mccains facts are literally true but his insinuation that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time is false
1802855 if a presidential candidate tells me he is going to raise my taxes then you can bet there is no way he will get my vote if he tells me that he is going to raise the capital gains taxes i will give him an f in economics and adivise other people not to vote for him due to his poor understanding of economics if he claims there are 57 states i will give him an f in history i will also wonder why this story is passed over by the press especially considering the grief that dan quial got for just misspelling a word my only adivce to obama is that surly the press has given you a long list of passes on your gafes but this will only be tolerated by them for so long and then they will come after you
1802856 what seems necessary is for all the news media to do what the post and times did to state uneviqocally that the mccain campaign is lying and for reporters to ask mccain why he is repeating a lie
1802857 if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
1802858 flying too low over the iberian peninsula he took out some power lines
1802859 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
1802860 hanoi has aired a broadcast in which the pilot son of united states commander in the pacific adm john mccain purportedly admits to having bombed civilian targets in north vietnam and praises medical treatment he has received since being taken prisoner
1802861 the english language broadcast beamed at south vietnam was one of a series using american prisoners it was in response to a plea by defense secretary melvin s laird may 19 that north vietnam treat prisoners according to the humanitarian standards set forth by the geneva convention
1802862 that equals to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
1802863 if you can show us that the information presented in our mailer is untruthful we will stand down
1802864 these ads make no sense we never wanted reporters in the hospitals
1802865 feed him some disinformation and hope he regurgitates it to the press which will have been given a covert heads up
1802866 in essence the mccain charge is this obama cares so little for the welfare of wounded american soldiers that he canceled the visit when he was informed he could not bring reporters and television cameras to document it but there is no evidence that obama ever planned to bring anyone to the hospital other than a single military adviser whose status as a campaign staffer sparked last minute concern among pentagon officials that the visit would be an improper political event the obama campaign has cited those concerns as the reason for canceling obamas visit
1802867 the cancellation provided one of the few sour notes in an overseas trip that otherwise seemed to be well orchestrated it offered an opening on a subject military affairs that the mccain campaign believes mr obama is vulnerable on
1802868 he decided not to put the troops in that position
1802869 obama has him chasing his tail and mccain doesnt even know it
1802870 obama is such a scum bag he is going to destroy this country
1802871 obama has him chasing his tail and mccain doesnt even know it
1802872 if senator mccains campaign gets its way the obama campaign cant use that shot
1802873 feed him some disinformation and hope he regurgitates it to the press which will have been given a covert heads up
1802874 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving

1802876 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time

1802912 a change in the phase of the economy may have taken place
1802913 from prehistoric times man has sought to worship powers of nature or symbols representing those powers or idols representing those symbols in vulgar minds they become debased superstitions and seem to come into competition with the worship of the one true god but the names of the false gods are interesting to us from the point of view of comparative religion as under one form or another such cults still exist in countries which have not accepted the gospel of unity as they have always existed since man turned from his maker and sustainer to the worship of created things or invented fancies

1803131 republicans arent even responsible for what their campaign managers say or what they say themselves you got a problem with that
1803132 lets look at jared polis record on education polis has pushed for conservative ideas that have undermined public schools

1803151 this is a huge problem for china we already have about 20 million boys who will never be able to marry because there arent enough women
1803152 it will bring crime and prostitution it will destabilize china
1803153 wow theres a lot of criminal activity there lets nail the criminals
1803154 the situation with this team is we are all new to each other
1803155 its not a boot camp it just gives us the opportunity to know how were going to travel its a teaching environment these guys have to get a feel for what we want to do
1803156 we did the best we could at the last minute to get a mix of teams with different styles of play every game will be a challenge for us
1803157 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
1803158 we have seven new guys coming in that are great guys and looking to win thats the biggest thing the program is ready to win
1803159 these men and women sacrifice so much to serve our country
1803160 for me to be given the opportunity to show our support is unbelievable im very very honored to be part of it
1803161 for eight days we hope to give them a little fun and little bit of home back to them they put themselves in harms way every day and it will be a great honor to be over there with them

1803164 the project which seeks to involve a wide range of audiences and engage them at different levels offers alternative ways to understand the history ideology and lines of thought that have significantly impacted political social and cultural events in the americas
1803165 close to 50 per cent of the respondents spoken to have suffered some form of abuse
1803166 twenty five per cent of the children have suffered sexual abuse in more than 30 per cent of the cases relatives of the child are involved
1803167 nearly 71 per cent have been physically beaten by persons in position of authority
1803168 in more than 56 per cent of the cases in new delhi the beating resulted in bleeding
1803169 the government is very keen on registering seminaries but it pays no attention to improving the living conditions of the students especially those residing there
1803170 this is often attributed to seminaries in order to defame islam
1803171 in order to curb this menace a qari monitors the rooms or a hall where 10 to 20 students live
1803172 islam has fixed stricter punishment for committing sodomy than that for fornication however under the pakistan penal code the accused of sodomy faces an imprisonment for only 14 years
1803173 though a medico legal report is important in a case when a victim reports the incident several days after sodomy has been committed it is difficult to establish it however a witness from the side of the victim is enough to get the accused penalised
1803174 the government should at least provide shelter after rescuing all destitute boys and girls from the roads because there they are an easy prey for perpetrators
1803175 the statistics show that poverty compels people to make their children beg
1803176 ironically their parents or guardians know that by doing so they are exposing their children to sexual abuse as well perhaps they have no other alternative
1803177 they lured me to addiction because they wanted to abuse me
1803178 my elder brother and i used to seek alms at intersections considering it an easy way to make some buck my brother however does not sniff glue smoke hashish or opium the intoxicants i had developed a taste for
1803179 when the bureau first handed me over to my father he gave me a sound thrashing my fathers hostile attitude forced me to quit home again and join the company of the same boys
1803180 during the day we would beg and in the evening we would smoke up whatever we could lay our hands on the older boys told me how to save money by taking free breakfast and lunch from baba chhatriwala on ravi road and the evening meal at data darbar

1803184 the mission of this non profit association is to develop a low cost laptop a technology that could revolutionize how we educate the worlds children our goal is to provide children around the world with new opportunities to explore experiment and express themselves
1803185 i think the olpc project has a lofty goal and i wish it an absolute success but there are some issues about the project that bother me
1803186 its not a gift its a laptop textbooks trade off even at 100us per laptop giving one to every kid in a country requires a substantial amount of money where will it come from from the education budget of participating countries
1803187 technology is used in a broader context to satisfy a medical or human right need then again technology is used to kill other people too
1803188 maybe thats why medical military and human rights teams do use technology to achieve their missions
1803189 men who have diabolical intentions to jeopardize the future of the girls in the communities should be dealt with seriously in order to deter them from such practices
1803190 the worst thing is that some of the recalcitrant students have joined the youth with questionable characters in the community and engaged in drug peddling and abuse
1803191 as a country we should commit ourselves to reverse the past trend of irregularity in census taking and under utilization of census data so that census results become a basis for informed policy formulation programme implementation and socio economic development
1803192 we are also as part of the process confirming district boundaries both new and old so that data collected can be presented for each respective district
1803193 the quality of education the achievement of universal primary education
1803194 quality education the role of the private school teacher in ghana
1803195 it is a responsibility and together we can do it
1803196 our research desk have confirmed that the minors aging between fifteen 15 and seventeen 17 years have been given money of various sums and an assurance that they are in government and as such nobody can prosecute them if they register
1803197 the most unfortunate aspect of their behaviour is when they do anything wrong they justify it with the wrongs of the past administration
1803198 minors not to attempt or dare to coming close to registration centre otherwise if they manage to register we shall prepare a dossier on them between now and december 7th and resist their attempt to vote
1803199 the situation calls for unity of purpose from all and sundry it also calls for total commitment of all assembly members traditional council youth groups and all stakeholders in ashaiman

1803204 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
1803205 worry is assuming responsibility that god never intended for you to have

1803209 did you do something you feel bad about or hurt somebodys feelings at school
1803210 thats ok you dont have to say if you dont want but whats the problem with thinking this thing
1803211 i dont at all but i cant get my brain to stop thinking about this word i heard somebody say at school its a really nasty word and i dont like it but it keeps popping into my brain no matter what i do and it makes me feel really really bad
1803212 listen to me b you are never bad just for thinking about something never
1803213 what but if its bad to say a bad word then its bad to think it
1803214 but how can you decide whether its bad if you dont even let yourself think it
1803215 yes it is its fine erin you cant stop your brain from thinking especially a huge brain like yours and youll make yourself crazy if you even try
1803216 it is never bad to think something you have permission to think about everything in the world what comes after thinking is deciding whether to keep that thought or to throw it away thats called your judgment a lot of times its wrong to act on certain thoughts but it is never ever wrong to let yourself think them

1803237 is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil
1803238 is one of the most urgent threats weve ever faced
1803239 and i will say that achieving them is absolutely necessary if we want to keep america safe and prosperous in the 21st century
1803240 its necessary if we want our families to thrive again to have good jobs with good wages that let them get ahead again

1803243 the government of ghana must follow the example of the ivorian government which on thursday july 19 2008 announced 50 per cent cut on salaries of all government officials in order to fund the importation of crude oil
1803244 even though we do not have empirical figures we believe with this arrangement the nation spends between ghc8 000 and ghc10 000 on each government official per month and view it as irresponsible application of the national revenue
1803245 we would like to state unequivocally that we do not subscribe to this kind of colonial arrangement where officials of government hide behind allowances and privileges to rob the nation of money that could be saved for national development
1803246 we therefore recommend a consolidation of all those allowances and privileges into a taxable income just as any civil servant earns a month

1803250 as far as i know this is the first time three groups have ever gotten together on the same night to investigate the same place
1803251 theyve come from customers theyve come from people that passed by on the street law enforcement officials
1803252 its not just a place thats trying to market ghosts to get people in the door theres really something going on
1803253 the more i got active the more i realized that i didnt want to find answers for stuff that was going on in my home
1803254 i just wanted to be able to get out and help people who didnt have the answers
1803255 it was something we talked about in high school over the lunch table
1803256 these are people trying to wrap their hands around a very big question and find their own answers
1803257 bullying and political motives as the reason why 100 000 to fund a senior housing development on pearl street was left off next years budget
1803258 we will speak up we will not be silenced said callahan conjuring up a round of applause
1803259 you dont expect to have the commitment made and have that derailed for political purposes he said
1803260 unfortunately what was promised to everyone else republican or democrat was not available to me she said
1803261 i was singled out because i had the courage to speak out
1803262 my single responsibility is to represent people in my district to bring a voice to those who sent me to boston she said
1803263 crucial to enabling a full range of us responses from diplomatic to military in the event of hostile action against our spacecraft
1803264 its a defensive step but one that assumes an attack
1803265 it is a baby step in the preparation for fighting in space
1803266 the us is becoming more vocal about protecting its satellites after chinas anti satellite test
1803267 and the reason is that the us is uniquely vulnerable because of its massive dependence on space systems for everything from high tech communications to satellite navigation
1803268 if you can hit the sensor with a big enough burst of energy it will blind optical sensors on a photoreconnaissance satellite the laser technology to perform this attack has been around since the 1980s
1803269 but i know of no evidence of it being used by the chinese government
1803270 think of it like the passing gear in an automatic transmission
1803271 the idea is to avoid running on electric power but save it for high acceleration needs

1803278 i also get a lot of religious emails and have come out of the closet finally due to getting them they have slowed but not stopped this is ok because this opens the door for me to finally voice my nonbeliefs after hearing all about theirs for years i suggest not ignoring religious emails we almost have a duty to stand up for ourselves and perhaps save them since they are trying to save us

1803285 i like coach dennis erickson and like the others i feel i have a good chance for early playing time at asu
1803286 for football i want to go to a school where i have a chance for early playing time i also want to be cool with the coaching staff

1803291 i think it will be a great fit and i look forward to helping a team that is in a great spot to make a run for an mls title
1803292 i think were obviously adding a quality player who brings another dimension and further options to our attack as we enter the final third of the season and playoff push
1803293 he has had a lot of success in this league and we look forward to having him for many good years in columbus

1803303 es necesario un mejor entendimiento de la problem tica de seguridad para eso record desde arcert estamos debatiendo si se pueden hacer controles preventivos ante un nuevo incidente ver si podemos prevenir aquellos que pueden afectar a los organismos gubernamentales hoy no tenemos esa atribuci n pero es parte de lo que hoy se est debatiendo de cara a la recategorizaci n de la entidad
1803304 los organismos del estado cuentan con informaci n muy sensible y son blanco de ataque precisamente por contener esta informaci n estamos hablando de datos tributarios y financieros de los ciudadanos por ejemplo que son blanco de inter s para generar bases de datos y luego venderlas
1803305 todos los d as hay alguna que otra actividad maliciosa que tiene alg n impacto sobre el estado
1803306 vemos mucho malware que son archivos espec ficos destinados a causar da o en un lugar puntual y se hostean en una alguna pc que no necesariamente se aloja una m quina del estado sino en alguna que est en argentina tambi n vemos phishing estafas en l nea mayoritariamente que est n hosteados en argentina y que afectan a entidades financieras externas y tambi n casos de defaced alteraci n o sustituci n de una p gina web gubernamental contra p ginas web tanto comerciales como de gobierno en la argentina
1803307 es importante recibir cada vez m s reportes de aquellos que sufran ataques porque tal vez para no sentirse expuestos no denuncian la existencia de un incidente muchas veces se quej nos enteramos por otros canales y luego los organismos terminan confirmando que hab an sufrido un ataque hace falta mayor conciencia acerca de las ventajas de reportar los incidentes

1803309 horse pastures in the fall a perfect time to renovate
1803310 an example of one of them is utilizing temporary fencing in horse pastures to allow for maximum pasture productivity this fall and next spring

1803312 pat since i think you are the real winner of the night i wanted to give you my surfboard
1803313 i didnt win the do something award and was a little sad
1803314 when lauren won her award she dedicated the award to me and my work that made me feel special lauren didnt have to tell me that i was amazing she didnt have to go out of her way to give me a present and she didnt have to dedicate her award to me but she did simple kind and generous gestures like this make all the difference to me and i will never forget it
1803315 she stayed up all night making the ipod playlist for him and then offered the surfboard to him privately when there were no cameras around
1803316 we all look up to celebrities and i want to tell everyone that lauren conrad is an exceptional person more than a reality tv star or fashion designer but a person that i am proud to look up to
1803317 i hope that one day i can make someone feel as good about themselves as lauren conrad made me feel shouldnt we all want to make someone else feel great if we can come on celebrities make someones day it will make you feel good too

1803321 it would be a foolish distributor who took a product if it wasnt marketed for them
1803322 in the late 1990s competition was so keen that distributors were said to sell at or below cost and take their profit direct from the marketing funds they received from vendors vendors nowadays keep watch to see their marketing funds are actually spent on marketing but distribution runs on single figure profits and vendor marketing funds are a crucial aid

1803349 the bush administrations own energy department has reported that repealing the offshore drilling ban today wont produce oil or gas until 2017 and would have no impact on prices before 2030
1803350 the republican drill only plan doesnt work and theyve stood in the way of comprehensive legislation that would increase supply reduce prices protect consumers and transition
1803351 before we adjourned republicans blocked several bills that would have done something to address high gas prices in the near term drawing down oil from the nations own stockpile the strategic petroleum reserve curbing speculation in the energy markets expanding drilling in alaska and use it or lose it legislation requiring energy companies to use the 68 million acres of taxpayer owned land for which they already have drilling permits or allow others to drill on them

1803356 todays nuclear weapons were not designed with security and longevity as the top priorities
1803357 weve had an impassioned debate about whether that is more likely to be salts or perhaps ice or even some other materials that are more exotic

1803367 the chinese government places great importance on the incident the public security authorities are currently investigating with their utmost effort
1803368 we learned about that for the first time through japanese media reports we are currently looking into it

1803372 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1803373 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1803374 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1803375 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1803376 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1803377 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1803378 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies

1803380 while americans are struggling with gas prices john mccain is playing politics
1803381 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1803382 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another four billion in tax breaks
1803383 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1803384 in 2008 these winds are likely to be weaker than normal thereby increasing cyclonic vorticity and helping more and stronger storms to spin up
1803385 when people live that way they engage in high risk behaviour
1803386 when we first started we didnt have much experience and patients tended to be suspicious if these medications would work so their adherence was not good and that resulted in higher rates of drug resistance
1803387 17 6 percent of patients were found to be resistant to at least one drug
1803388 a small number of people are now trying out second line drugs to see if the medication is suitable
1803389 this is an important finding since there are effective medications to reduce gastric acid that can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding
1803390 more research will be needed to determine whether this is a viable strategy to improve outcomes after stroke in high risk patients
1803391 this finding especially in headwaters of a major lake system calls for a quick and precise response because eurasian water milfoil is considered more aggressive than the variable water milfoil which exists in 25 ponds and lakes in maine
1803392 we have seen in the recent past that a rapid response to a new infestation can significantly limit and even eradicate an invasive species thats our objective today
1803393 it is extraordinarily fortunate that we discovered this infestation of the highly invasive eurasian water milfoil early on
1803394 we are aggressively addressing the containment and removal of these plants following the rapid response plan we developed in 2006 we are also working cooperatively with the department of inland fisheries and wildlife to control surface water uses in the immediate area of the infestation in order to prevent the spread of this invasive plant we have been extremely fortunate to have kept this invasive plant at bay thanks to the work of many volunteers and staff at dep and ifw under maines invasive aquatic plant program
1803395 it should be viewed though as a stop gap on the way to real e records management including for e mail that allows for the functionalities that nara outlines

1803401 well i dun really know if it werkz or not lolz i looked at sum pics and it looks like it might but i really dun know lolz you shud just try it and tell us if it werkz or not rofl 111
1803402 yeah it might work i dunno theres lots of conflicting info out there why dont you just try it and see
1803403 im getting a cr x so i need more info on d series engines but really it doesnt matter since im just getting rid of the d series and putting an ls in instead so whoopty freakin do what the hell am i even talking about
1803404 yeah it might work i dunno theres lots of conflicting info out there why dont you just try it and see
1803405 im getting a cr x so i need more info on d series engines but really it doesnt matter since im just getting rid of the d series and putting an ls in instead so whoopty freakin do what the hell am i even talking about
1803406 when we deliver our first sample to tega we want to be absolutely sure that we have what we want and deliver it properly
1803407 its really tricky because you have to give them all the steps and you cant quite tell what theyre doing
1803408 we tell the arm what it needs to think about and where the surface is and what motor motion it has to do to get there but its only six or eight hours later that we see what its done
1803409 it looks like we got much more soil than were use to working with and it might just have clogged the screens
1803410 the soil has actually moved but it hasnt moved very far
1803411 it seems convincing to me that the transmitter is helping to scatter electrons
1803412 however were going to take our time just to make sure that we do it right
1803413 i know we had a bit of drama yesterday relative to communication but there never was an issue with phoenix
1803414 this is a contingency that we had always planned for
1803415 our arm was cooped up in our restraints for 14 months
1803416 it was raring to go its busted loose now and were ready to go were excited
1803417 it couldnt be better im really looking forward over the next 90 sols 90 martian days for some major scientific breakthroughs
1803418 everything that we faced over the course of these last 4 sols on the surface of mars has been rather benign
1803419 a very expensive weather station on a plant without weather
1803420 it should have had tracks and landed in a place of interest
1803421 if we had a bad day on mars the picture was designed to help us figure out what went wrong
1803422 now its going to help us figure out better what went right for future missions
1803423 our tools at mars are getting so powerful now youre able to get a sense of what to expect before you get there in a way that you never could before
1803424 what this work establishes is that if there was an early window for life on mars it was indeed short
1803425 we looked at a variety of other localities including some martian meteorites
1803426 the important question is whether life could have originated at high salinity
1803427 its a sobering conclusion but i find it very convincing
1803428 they present a cogent argument that mars is and maybe always has been sterile
1803429 i find the arguments compelling the question is whether they are complete
1803430 is the appearance of water at the martian surface always governed by the same processes so we can be sure of its subsequent history i would say that it is probably too early in our state of investigation of mars to reach the sweeping conclusion they have
1803431 all these data suggest that yes youll get some killing but youre not going to get 100 sterility
1803432 there is a possibility youd get contamination but the probability is very low
1803433 if were going to rove into them were only going in with a very clean lander
1803434 the tega team has demonstrated that it will work perfectly fine and we can get all the sample that we need in the amount of open door that we have
1803435 it is just possible when we do future digging that we can do a very quick turnaround we could get from scoop to image in a short enough period of time to see ice in the microscope
1803436 we achieved far more than we expected in a very short time
1803437 the moon regolith is not like sand its more like compressed talcum powder
1803438 theres certainly a lot of things you could do if you poke things into the ground
1803439 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1803440 its a stable chemical it does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
1803441 could potentially keep a lot of graduate students busy for a very long time
1803442 frankly has not been through as much review and validation as theyd like
1803443 weve been able to find an aurora that seems to be very similar to jupiters
1803444 the recent detection of volcanic plumes on enceladus suggests thats probably the dominant source
1803445 this paper is a contribution that shows that saturn does have some auroral processes that are like jupiter
1803446 in the end we ended up with something pluto like and i dont think we could have done better
1803447 it sounds like hemorrhoid and it sounds like asteroid and of course these objects are planets and not asteroids
1803448 i think this pronouncement is one more step in the iaus increasing irrelevance
1803449 the iau could announce tomorrow that the sky is green but that doesnt make it so
1803450 we do not issue laws at the iau this is a working recommendation that will make life easier for people in the field
1803451 were looking to see if the ice has partly melted producing thin films of water and evaporating to produce salts
1803452 we are going to modify the process to acquire another icy sample and attempt to deliver it to tega
1803453 we will repeat what we did successfully with small modifications to adjust for what we learned
1803454 we were all very flabbergasted at the data we got back
1803455 this means that theres a broader range of organisms that can grow in this soil
1803456 there is nothing about it that would preclude life in fact it seems very friendly
1803457 we rehearsed all of the problems and none of them occurred
1803458 the way were going to land humans on mars is with propulsive systems and landing legs
1803459 life on earth has radiated into every conceivable and in some cases almost inconceivable ecological niche
1803460 jupiters moon europa is thought to harbour an ocean under its icy crust any life in the ocean would have to survive temperatures of 90 c
1803461 how come nasa hasnt put any telescopes on the moon yet
1803462 i thought you could get far better resolution than even hubble on the moon
1803463 the more flux comes out of the sun the faster those pieces will decay back to earth and get out of the way of other satellites
1803464 if its a low solar cycle the pieces will be up there for much longer
1803465 anything over 1 centimetre can really cause problems almost for any satellite if it happens to hit an instrument or an antenna it could completely disable it
1803466 our committee has really split right down the middle with an above average prediction and a below average prediction

1803495 ive consistently believed when it comes whether its native american issues whether its african american issues and reparations that the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just to offer words but offer deeds
1803496 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
1803497 ive consistently believed when it comes whether its native american issues whether its african american issues and reparations that the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just to offer words but offer deeds
1803498 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed and i think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and jim crow but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done that i think is the best strategy
1803499 members of the press havent asked sen obama to explain what he means by saying that the u s government should offer deeds regarding reparations
1803500 if the press insists on hinging on every word of obama cant they at least ask for clarifications and details about his sweeping proclamations
1803501 the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
1803502 seem ed to be something of an endorsement of the idea of reparations for slavery which is usually taken to mean cash payments

1803517 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1803518 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1803519 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1803520 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1803521 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1803522 i can expect mmts but not in the near future
1803523 people are herded as pigs in push pull kakatiya when there is so much potential and trafiic why rlys not runing more services every inch of bogie was filled with passengers when i travelled by push pull from bhongir to jangaon both my journeys were on a working day and at odd hours 3 30pm and 11 30am i sent a note to scr on this occasion too
1803524 hope someone in rlys will take seriously my note and
1803525 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
1803526 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
1803527 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
1803528 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
1803529 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
1803530 i think its pretty likely well see water release at those temperatures
1803531 seems unbelievable that they fitted a camera that cannot accurately resolve images 4 feet away my pocket canon could do a better job at twice the distance
1803532 this is exactly what the lander was designed to do
1803533 my pocket canon could do a better job at twice the distance
1803534 i didnt think it would get mashed between two of the largest storms in the solar system
1803535 jupiters third giant red storm has been chewed up by a collision
1803536 it appears jupiters third spot was torn up last week
1803537 amateur astronomers broke the news of the spots stormy dismemberment
1803538 both of these results point therefore to an active source for mercurys magnetic field a dynamo stirred by motions in mercurys fluid outer core
1803539 in order for such shrinking to take place mercury must have had a molten liquid core that has cooled and contracted over time
1803540 these little clumps completely disappearing over the course of a few days that is perfect evidence
1803541 we have dug a trench and uncovered a hard layer at the same depth as the ice layer in our other trench
1803542 in a word yes there is a link the last two words in the first paragraph to a before and after shot that shows ice then nothing in a very short amount of time shadows show some time elapse is that significant enough
1803543 we believe these things are water ice and in the process of sitting out in the cold but very dry atmosphere they sublimated
1803544 it would be the equivalent of having water ice on a 140 day on earth
1803545 its not going to be there very long not long enough to take its picture
1803546 one of our great fears was that wed see ice for example under the lander and the arm wouldnt be able to reach it
1803547 finding out what is mixed in with the ice and to what extent its a habitable environment
1803548 have to be there if youre going to have a habitable zone on mars
1803549 looks like an ice layer and feels like an ice layer
1803550 weve got hard layers that are different we hope to learn a lot from those differences
1803551 ice at 80 or 90 c is as hard as a table top
1803552 the presence of these sizable sources in areas that are potentially attractive targets for attack is a major factor making radioactive caesium chloride such a concern to the committee
1803553 eight radionuclides account for more than 99 of the sealed sources that pose the highest security risks in the united states caesium 137 in the form of caesium chloride poses greater concern than the others because it is widely used in significant quantities and is soluble and dispersible
1803554 weve finally touched it and tasted it it tastes very fine
1803555 we named it after the witch from hansel and gretel who saw her final demise by being pushed into an oven
1803556 we usually think of soil as the impurity in the ice
1803557 in this case you could almost say the ice is the impurity in the soil
1803558 were looking beyond finding water to finding habitats for life
1803559 its most likely an organic particle made of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen possibly from the wild 2 comet
1803560 this is not at all unexpected we have around 100 candidates and weve only looked at the first six
1803561 this one was hard often theres a name that sort of speaks to you that directly relates to the object
1803562 one of the difficulties we have is coming up with an analogue that behaves exactly the same way as the soil on mars
1803563 we tried to put together a size distribution that combines our knowledge from the previous five landers
1803564 what im really worried about is how were going to handle the icy substrate
1803565 i think weve gotten to the point where weve come up with a simulant that replicates general conditions on mars
1803566 the main problem is that these systems do not have the discriminative power to do that
1803567 it is based i think on a mythical view of ai
1803568 we have to say where we want to draw the line and what we want to do and then get an international agreement
1803569 i have a moral responsibility to make sure that these weapons are introduced responsibly and ethically and reduce risks to non combatants
1803570 with a robot i can be sure that a robot will never harbour the intention to hurt a non combatant
1803571 ultimately they will be able to perform better than humans
1803572 i hope an autonomous system could realise that man was clearly incapacitated effectively a prisoner of war and should not have been killed
1803573 one of the fundamental abilities i want to give these systems is to refuse an order and explain why
1803574 we cannot make them that generally intelligent they will be more like dogs used for specialised situations
1803575 for those situations we have very clear cut guidance from the geneva convention the hague and elsewhere about what is ethical
1803576 were very confident that we hit the satellite we also have a high degree of confidence that we got the tank
1803577 from our position you always want to hedge your bet because theres no absolute certainty
1803578 that unto itself was not enough reason to go after this satellite with a missile
1803579 prior to this study the gravity tractor deflection technique had been proven in only a conceptual way
1803580 although there were few if any substantive criticisms of these concepts some of us had the feeling that the ideas were viewed as quaint but not ready for prime time
1803581 the jpl study gives it the solid engineering underpinnings that we never really doubted but now are there for anyone to see
1803582 the gravity tractor is a wimp but its a precise wimp
1803583 it can make very small precise changes in orbit and thats what you need to avoid a keyhole
1803584 we have a little bitty spacecraft with this monster swinging its butt at it
1803585 born of a single quantum event the universe is at some basic level a single interconnected quantum system there are no truly independent pieces of this system and therefore no random and uncontrollable interactions to impose a classical solidity on the quantum maelstrom once a quantum system always a quantum system
1803586 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices virtual planckian black holes
1803587 a more fundamental property than the disappearance of viscosity becomes visible if superfluid is placed in a rotating container
1803588 there could be a way to feel the ether more directly theory predicts that the quantum vacuum behaves in some ways like a viscous fluid according to general relativity a gravitational field is just a distortion of the geometry of space time and it turns out that bending space puts a strain on the quantum ether if this strain changes with time you get friction leonard parker discovered in the late 1960s that an expanding or contracting universe would create particles out of a pure vacuum in effect the stretching of space jiggles up some of the virtual particles and turns them into real particles
1803589 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices
1803590 i think the biggest thing for people to be concerned about really is the fact that we dont have that kind of strategic understanding of the chinese intentions
1803591 china is developing a multi dimensional program to limit or prevent the use of space based assets by its potential adversaries during times of crisis or conflict
1803592 the pla is also exploring satellite jammers kinetic energy weapons high powered lasers high powered microwave weapons particle beam weapons and electromagnetic pulse weapons for counterspace application
1803593 we continue to ask the chinese to sit down and talk to us about that test and they havent
1803594 many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for computer network attack
1803595 developing capabilities for cyberwarfare is consistent with authoritative pla writings on this subject
1803596 china is developing weapons that would disable its enemies space technology such as satellites in a conflict

1803599 nothing new will let you know when something is done
1803600 it says right in the introduction that its dedicated to his family
1803601 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book
1803602 i t is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
1803603 if youll read carefully what media matters said they point out there is no dedication page even in the second edition
1803604 and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
1803605 obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather
1803606 m issing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
1803607 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack sr or to his indonesian stepfather
1803608 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
1803609 the economic health of every country is a proper matter of concern to all its neighbors near and far
1803610 i am excited that we have the opportunity to expand our programs in a place as full of energy and focus on innovation as aus school of communication
1803611 our new affiliation is a good fit for mission which is to help transform journalism for today and reinvent it for tomorrow
1803612 jan schaffers j lab is a great fit for aus school of communication
1803613 the mission and achievements of j lab reflect americans intense focus on interactive and converged media and our deep commitment to public service and public affairs j lab will join our center for social media and investigative reporting workshop thanks to move and to the knight foundations support we have a critical mass of talent and expertise for innovation in journalism and democracy in the digital age
1803614 knight foundation is dedicated to helping create transformational change in journalism with american universitys support j lab can do that even more effectively
1803615 we think a lot of bad things that happen to the cardiovascular system are because the lining of the vessels cracks and becomes inflamed setting the stage for plaques to form and rupture
1803616 we want to show the world that change is possible and highlighting the selfless work these individuals are doing to rid the world of slavery is a great place to start
1803617 while there is a great deal of work to be done there are countless stories of survival and hope and the freedom awards will provide a wonderful venue to celebrate the progress being made
1803618 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1803619 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1803620 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1803621 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1803622 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1803623 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1803624 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1803625 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1803626 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together

1803628 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
1803629 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
1803630 while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families
1803631 a compelling positive storyline for yourself a less appealing one about your opponent
1803632 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically
1803633 he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time
1803634 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again

1803662 microsoft has always had a strong commitment to working closely with partners and the industry to enable them to leverage our tools and platform to deliver great user experiences
1803663 with hundreds of advertisers multiple platforms and large site traffic spikes we needed to work with a partner that could provide an integrated scalable robust solution
1803664 by expanding doubleclick to work with silverlight 2 we can make it possible for clients to create unique entertainment and advertising experiences without increasing their workload or creating new complex processes said google product manager ari paparo

1803672 its clear to us that we do not want to be in the search engine marketing business maintaining objectivity in both search and advertising is paramount to googles mission and core to the trust we ask from our users for this reason we plan to sell the performics search marketing business to a third party
1803673 we believe this will allow us to maintain objectivity and the search marketing business to continue to grow and innovate and serve its customers
1803674 the ministry by law is supposed to come out with the guidelines to determine the levies but the guidelines have stopped coming for over five years now
1803675 the stoppage of the guidelines issuance is a very very important lapse on the part of the ministry and since they no longer come the assemblies are forced to do their own thing

1803693 theyre purposely kept anonymous so that nobody can influence their vote
1803694 i just think hes just brilliant anything hes ever done
1803695 to have been taken out of this world so early in his career its sort of like a hank williams story but yet hes changed country music for the good
1803696 hes been dead almost 20 years and his music has stood the test of time
1803697 its been almost 20 years and theres still all these artists dropping his name as an influence

1803723 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1803724 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1803725 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1803726 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1803727 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me

1803736 the united states denies as a matter of law and fact that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought
1803737 it sounds like you are a great example of somebody who came into the sport of hunting much later than most
1803738 exactly when you find spare time in the offseason as you play sports you meet more people they put you on to it to come try it and if you like it you like it
1803739 ten years ago did you ever imagine yourself being a guy who would hunt deer
1803740 not at all never coming from california dye now 34 was born in vacaville calif i would never envision myself doing this if i had probably been playing for another team in another city that wasnt really known for populations of deer and ducks i probably wouldnt be doing it but you try something and you like it you never know
1803741 you know shane halter then shortstop with the detroit tigers and you guys have a hunting relationship is that right
1803742 yeah in the offseason i kind of got hooked up with him when he used to play for the royals he introduced me to a couple of his hunting friends and they got me hooked he lives here in kansas city in the offseason and we go just about five times a week once the season ends
1803743 was shane responsible for turning you on to the bowhunting side of things
1803744 i like a challenge and i view bowhunting as harder than hunting with a rifle halter kind of got me hooked on it one day we were shooting his bow and arrow and i kind of liked it i went out two years ago and bought one and went out and started hunting
1803745 we hunt on then new york mets pitcher kevin appiers land he still lives here in kansas city
1803746 i think it helps to get away from the sport of baseball and gives you a little quiet time and relax time and just lets you think about being outdoors enjoying the moment it gets your adrenaline going when you see that deer from about 100 yards walking your way
1803747 when i first got my bow and arrow i went out a couple of times and i got my first shot and shot an eight point whitetail so ive got one with my bow and arrow and one nine pointer last offseason with my rifle
1803748 never did it its kind of funny because the guys i go with have been hunting for so long and have maybe killed one deer every time ive gone ive seen a deer and let some go or shot one the first time i shot with my rifle i took a nine pointer after 10 minutes in my stand the guys get on me because they think that it is not fair for me to just start and have two trophy bucks
1803749 so the nine pointer was the first shot ever at a deer
1803750 with my rifle yes and i was in my stand for no more than 10 minutes shane was actually walking down to his stand and couldnt believe it
1803751 what was that experience like some people would say that is amazing you may never get to put a scope on a bigger buck
1803752 exactly i think just from me being able to shoot a shotgun and go duck hunting and stuff i anticipated what it was going to feel like but you still have that feeling of what is going to really be like am i going to be able to keep the rifle steady when i pull the trigger but it came out all right
1803753 yeah ive shot handguns at target ranges but i never felt the power of a rifle from your shoulder
1803754 i like summer sausage and deer jerky but the steaks and the hamburgers i dont really like
1803755 if nobody wants the meat whether it is deer or duck or geese we send it down to the mission and donate it
1803756 what would you say your most memorable day in the field has been and why
1803757 i think my first shot with my bow and arrow it was getting dark and here is this buck trotting over the hill a little bit it was probably my only chance to get a shot off with it getting dark where he was everything played out right the wind was in my face i probably wouldnt have taken the shot if it was earlier because it was a little farther than i wanted but i got him
1803758 yeah but this was the first animal you had taken with a bow what was going through your head
1803759 adrenaline was pumping heart was pumping i just tried to be as calm as i could be and try to pick a spot where i thought he was going to cross over hit the release and calm my nerves i couldnt really tell if i had hit him at first he jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran into some brush i called up kevin and shane and we went looking for him and found him
1803760 i think some athletes i dont know if this is true of everybody compare the adrenaline rush of reeling in a big fish or taking down a whitetail to getting a big hit or making a big play
1803761 i think so anytime you have that adrenaline flowing in hunting and fishing its like the other day in boston we were down by one run in the ninth inning and their closer comes in and i hit a home run to put us in extra innings you get a great feeling from that giving your team a chance to win and we went on to win that game in the 11th inning with another home run
1803762 in the offseason you arent playing baseball youre a competitor though looking for a thrill does hunting fill that gap to some extent
1803763 i think so i cant sit around the house with wife tricia and son jalen doing nothing ive always got to be doing something and the hunting and the fishing takes your mind away from things and puts the competition in your mind you arent stepping in the batters box youre competing with your buddy to catch fish
1803764 thats funny you should mention that is there friendly competition when you get athletes together in the offseason even if it is fishing
1803765 definitely i have a boat and shane has a boat we pack two or three people in there and whoever catches the most fish gets his meal paid for
1803766 so how are you described as a baseball player and does that carry over to hunting or fishing at all
1803767 i think im described as a hard working person who goes out there and plays hard every day and has fun doing it and i think im the same way outdoors i just go out and have fun i dont have to kill anything that day just the joy of being out there and enjoying the atmosphere and being in the wildlife thats fun for me
1803768 he doesnt have any skeletons in his closet hes eaten them all
1803769 as everything falls into place for everyone else im still waiting
1803770 the assumption in the garage is that im back at red bull but they have the option and havent picked it up yet
1803771 i want to be here when they put mike skinner in the car i easily couldve said forget this im tired of it but i didnt want to do that i wanted to improve and i feel like ive done that i want to drive for red bull
1803772 those images of him in victory lane made people wonder about him
1803773 over the past couple of weeks i think ive been able to show my peers i can run up front
1803774 that team is better than its ever been and aj is better than hes ever been
1803775 that means results on the track he must continue to have results
1803776 were not in any hurry to advance scott we will evaluate and graduate him as we go but were in no hurry to make him a full time cup guy
1803777 we are evaluating where aj and scott are we have three very good young race car drivers we should know in the next 30 to 45 days have some conclusion by then about our situation the situation were in is good because these guys are all performing now
1803778 red bull gives us phenomenal support but theres no expectation or enthusiasm to sponsor three cars
1803779 weve been so busy just trying to get the 83 in the chase get the 84 in the top 35 and challenge scott with different things weve had success lately but were not in any hurry to sit down and map out future because weve been working so much in the present but in next 30 to 45 days well need to figure out the next step
1803780 well twist those lids and hope our kids look more like me than you
1803781 im a million miles away i have to turn on national television and see you dancing with another guy oh thats great
1803782 lunch tomorrow 1 15 p m 2 00 p m

1803784 ratings play a bigger role in a studios financial plan
1803785 we want to market this as a pg 13 movie
1803786 we dont guarantee the film made from a script will get a certain rating but we can give them an idea
1803787 we wanted to provide a place where parents can turn to for neutral objective information on the games their kids might want to play
1803788 the university authorities have now made clear that possession of this material is not required for the purpose of your course of study nor do they consider it legitimate for you to possess it for research purposes

1803790 ahora s lo necesitamos un intermediario que se encargue de convencer a esos ni atos caprichosos que se creen alguien importante cuando alguien se dirige a ellos directamente claro zync ya han conseguido visibilidad y contactos y adem s podemos camuflar nuestos enlaces dentro de un texto completo lo que les va a dar mayor puntuaci n para el buscador
1803791 la cuesti n es que me ha llegado una oferta de zync de xxx viajes donde nos dice qu debemos de escribir d nde debemos de enlazar con qu anchor y encima que no enlacemos m s m s o menos lo que le falta es escribirnos el post pues que me perdone el encrgado de marketing online de xxx pero eso ni es marketing ni es na eso es una mierda y en mi pais se llama compra de enlaces claramente se las suda el contenido mientras no sea perjudicial
1803792 a mi personalmente me ha encantado el analisis y al verdad es que tiene raz n en muchas cosas cosas que creo que hay que cambiar
1803793 nuestra blogger prob el producto y no acab de satisfacerle as que antes de que hiciera este segundo an lisis me puse en contacto con el responsable de la compa a para comentarle este punto soy consciente de que a las empresas no les guste que les critiquen y menos a n pagar para recibir cr ticas as que prefer curarme en salud y pedirles su opini n antes de continuar con el proceso la verdad es que me sorprendieron gratamente y nos dijeron que como ya hab amos acordado este segundo an lisis lo har amos aunque tuviera algunas connotaciones negativas
1803794 caregivers tell us they need access to a community wide health history for a patient but they are already overwhelmed with too much information dumping more data from more clinics and hospitals onto the doctors desktop is not going to be accepted or effective
1803795 organizing the discrete fragmented healthcare data we get from medical claims acute and ambulatory electronic medical records and other sources into disease based clusters is critical to deal with this cognitive overload
1803796 delivering patient information in this way enables clinicians to easily find the links between diseases and complications so they can better manage the patients care
1803797 meg enables physicians to quickly grasp the complexity and severity of a patients condition
1803798 coupled with careevolutions software this patient profile can provide physicians with a timely easy to use summary of their patients medical care
1803799 this is a decisive blow to the pas attempts to shirk its responsibility to the damages and suffering it has caused and still causes to many of the nations citizens

1803804 are you ready to see whats in our scary box
1803805 i think that we should be looking to create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than just israel
1803806 we will let the iranians know that yes an attack on israel would trigger massive retaliation but so would an attack on those countries that are willing to go under the security umbrella and forswear their own nuclear ambitions
1803807 treacherous alliance the secret dealings of israel iran and the u s
1803808 to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete
1803809 could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our soil or that of our allies
1803810 space systems could provide on demand near global access to ballistic missile threats

1803812 my suspicion would be that theres black money from the classified part of the budget going into it
1803813 if one warhead were to detonate it is possible that the other seven warheads in the storage cell could be engulfed in the fire which is virtually certain to ensue from the rupture of the missiles fuel tanks
1803814 does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons at any particular place at any particular time
1803815 there has never been an accident involving nuclear weapons in the uk that has put the public at risk the mod maintains the highest standards of safety and security during the storage or transport of nuclear weapons
1803816 our commitment to covering football is bigger than its ever been
1803817 our decision to give football fans the top local sports stories right after nfl football shows that nbc 5 is the place to be for diehard bears fans not only will we have all the highlights and post game reaction we will have engaging unfiltered analysis from chicagos best known sports radio personalities
1803818 this is as excited as the nbc5 sports team has ever been
1803819 our new relationships with current and former bears along with our groundbreaking agreement with the competing sports radio stations in town gives us an opportunity to bring fans not only great coverage of chicago sports but a free wheeling forum in which to discuss the hot topics both on and off the field this expanded sports sunday promises to be the place to be for everything from bears highlights and analysis to pennant race breakdowns on both sides of town

1803822 i think magicians and cognitive neuroscientists are getting at similar questions but while neuroscientists have been looking at this for a few decades magicians have been looking at this for centuries millennia probably what magicians do is light years ahead in terms of sophistication and the power of these techniques

1803828 instead of a culture of responsibility the federal government has instilled a culture of denial
1803829 labs hide problems and think that accident reporting is for masochists
1803830 i think the answer is to create a level playing field by having clear and absolutely mandatory reporting requirements
1803831 eliminate even the possibility of an institution claiming that it does not have to report infections
1803832 people armed with tasers will now aim at the head the officer may end up blind
1803833 we have to fulfil our obligations and commitments if we expect non nuclear parties to cooperate
1803834 got sucked into this rather amusing exchange of e mail communications

1803836 effects of backward speech and speaker variability in language discrimination by rats
1803837 like many weapons these days you can fire this gun from a remote position
1803838 if a shell was jammed in the breech and the cordite then fired it could set off the ammunition in the canisters
1803839 its a very tragic accident but it is not a robot gone out of control
1803840 i think it is bad luck more than anything else the shells move through the gun so fast you only have to be a fraction out for something to go wrong
1803841 if a country has the technology to loft a satellite into space then it is exactly the same type of technology necessary to launch a warhead thousands of miles
1803842 this could be iran telling israel that whatever you can do we can do too
1803843 iran could easily just be planning to launch civilian satellites
1803844 if you ask pentakika to pray then rain will fall
1803845 in fact youd probably consider me a lowlife im the custodian of a brothel and when im not cleaning the place up or taking their clothes to and from the bath house i appear with the hookers on stage and play a drum while they dance and perform when im not doing that i just entertain them
1803846 theres more to you than that isnt there are you sure that you never did some very special deed
1803847 you know rabbi there is something i remember not long ago a young israelite woman came backstage on the brothel theater crying her eyes out i asked her why she was so distressed she told me that the romans jailed her husband and that she needed money to gain his release the young lady barely had money for bread and water the only way she imagined to raise money for her husbands release was by selling herself to prostitution i saw that she was an innocent young wife from a good home so i wouldnt allow her to entertain such a thought i therefore sold my bed my mattress and my pillow and gave her the money she arranged her husbands release the same day
1803848 you are surely worthy of having your prayers answered for your deeds are purest altruism
1803849 estoy contento porque ha sido un gran triunfo despu s de tantos a os luchando pero por suerte o por desgracia no hay tiempo para disfrutarlo ahora estamos aqu viviendo una experiencia bonita y distinta y trataremos de hacerlo lo mejor posible
1803850 la verdad es que es una experiencia inolvidable estar aqu con el resto de deportistas y tener la oportunidad de ver y conocer a algunos a los que veo por la tele

1803855 here in germany we block the web sites of right wing radicals
1803856 and its natural that china would also block some sites but they have to provide access to the important information that journalists need in order to be able to do their jobs
1803857 instead of demanding that the chinese ensure freedom of the press
1803858 very clearly expressed that he found the blocking of internet sites unacceptable
1803859 there are far right internet pages that we block and of course its also the case in china that some sites are blocked
1803860 were not talking here about internet pages with prosecutable content were talking about amnesty international
1803861 instead of making demands of the chinese side vesper has trivialized and justified chinas behavior
1803862 ive always opposed censorship in china to accuse me of the opposite is unfair wrong and absurd
1803863 im going to kill senator feingold on july 4th may thomas gt paine smile upon me and alexander hamilton bless my cause gt praise the lord and pass the ammunition

1803865 sometimes my mom tells me i was voted number one whatever in israel
1803866 television transmissions from terrestrial transmitters could be used like gps
1803867 its one of the easiest things to detect because its a huge bright signal
1803868 its furthering along hit to kill technology for space based missile defence
1803869 i think thats a serious step that we really need to think through before we take
1803870 it is doable with basic knowledge and off the shelf information
1803871 we didnt see anything that would put anyone at risk our study shows there are no lasting effects at all
1803872 its the same population sometimes in restraining them they die sometimes after pepper spray they die the rates dont seem to be changing in all likelihood these deaths are associated with excited delirium
1803873 tasers are in all likelihood preventing more injuries and deaths than they are causing
1803874 we now have just over half a million uses of taser on people either in training or in the operational environment
1803875 under 300 people have died when the taser is used appropriately it is by far the least lethal technology
1803876 if the police set that standard the guy down at the convenience store will think he can do that too
1803877 we oppose their general sale to members of the public where there are no controls no oversight
1803878 there is a huge temptation for criminal elements to use tasers as an incapacitating tool for whatever they want to do whether its robbery mugging or rape
1803879 it combines the well known dangers of impact projectiles inaccuracy potential for serious injury with a taser shock four times longer than usual which also carries an increased risk to the health of the victim
1803880 my overall concern with all three developments is that they would further remove the process of human interaction negotiation and reasoning from the decision by police to use force
1803881 well make decisions each day as to whether were going to proceed or not
1803882 weve been very clear about why the president made this decision
1803883 this is about reducing risk to human life on earth
1803884 weapons deployment in space by one state will inevitably result in a chain reaction
1803885 this in turn is fraught with a new spiral in the arms race both in space and on earth
1803886 which lasted over four decades and resulted in a gigantic waste of material and other resources at the expense of finding solutions to the problem of development
1803887 a peaceful and tranquil outer space and prevention of an arms race serves the common interests of all countries
1803888 i hope the conference on disarmament will start subsequent discussions and reach consensus on it the treaty as soon as possible
1803889 this interceptor is really intended for missiles travelling at 3 to 4 kilometres per second the satellite theyre going to be shooting at has a speed of 7 to 8 kilometres per second
1803890 has never wanted to explicitly say the missile defense system has an anti satellite capability so theyre dancing to say that we had to modify the system
1803891 do they understand this well enough to quantify the risk to the space station
1803892 no one thinks they are trying to defy the treaty it is just taking a long time to destroy these things
1803893 imagine peeling the roof off the building and watching people go about their lives like in an ant farm
1803894 you cant identify individual ants or keep track of them as they scurry past each other but you can watch as they move food into the nest or dig chambers
1803895 this recombinant virus like particle represents a novel and highly effective dually acting reagent for treatment and protection against anthrax
1803896 clearly the us government is keen to find a vaccine that requires fewer doses to boost compliance
1803897 one that acts as a medication could also be very useful
1803898 well need larger scale studies though to see how useful this new treatment actually is
1803899 the offensive materials directly contradict the values that my parents taught me and are forbidden in my parents home my facebook page is my sole responsibility

1803921 the epileptic seizure inducing device is grossly irresponsible and should never be fielded
1803922 we know from similar chemically artificially induced fits that the victim subsequently remains
1803923 theres a long history of trying to develop micro robots that could be sent out as autonomous devices but i think many engineers have realised that they cant improve on mother nature
1803924 when the rat realised that it was no longer being controlled it went into odour sniffing mode
1803925 what you want to avoid is some way of detecting that its not a plain old insect or some situation where its signals could be jammed
1803926 i was in the process of designing a new vision chip that would cost about 60 000 to make
1803927 it occurred to me that i was spending 60 000 to mimic a tiny portion of the flys brain when i could get better capabilities in a moth for 4
1803928 i have no sensible neurobiological explanation for why thats the case
1803929 we conclude that cfs is an oxygen toxic state and that oxygen toxicity status appears to determine outcome in therapeutic trials and is therefore a locus of control in chronic fatigue syndrome

1803945 he deliberately did it and in a very dimplomatic manner
1803946 this is a breakthrough technology thats going to give our forces a capability they dont now have
1803947 we expect the services to add it to their tool kit and that could happen as early as 2010
1803948 we now have the technology to see on the ground what the pilot sees before say a bomb is released
1803949 we are working with the british to put rover video downlinks on their fighters and forward air controllers there have already used it to great effect
1803950 we are taking advantage of the internet and ipod generation coming though the military
1803951 i think if it is used properly rover will virtually eliminate fratricide
1803952 we put btid through a series of battle runs in which a live enemy provoked the sorts of scenarios that can lead to fratricide to try and confuse btid vehicles would appear from all angles with no notice however it behaved itself and looks very promising
1803953 many of the nato nations have gps situational awareness built into their radio systems like the uks bowman radio
1803954 a central control centre then retransmits all the friendly vehicle locations to all the units in the network
1803955 the friendly fire problem will then be taken care of because these systems help prevent misidentification
1803956 putting gps radios on all vehicles is a huge tool in fratricide prevention even though it might not look like one
1803957 i have come to believe that by and large the human family all has the same secrets which are both very telling and very important to tell they are telling in the sense that they tell what is perhaps the central paradox of our condition that what we hunger for perhaps more than anything else is to be known in our full humanness and yet that is often just what we also fear more than anything else
1803958 in sum the purchase of goods and services is the largest single expenditure within most organizations therefore the single largest impact on company profitability is how well the procurement process is managed
1803959 having an easy to demonstrate return on investment is not enough companies many previously burned maintain a healthy cynicism regarding software applications to meet our commitment to educate all sized organizations about the benefits of esourcing we had to offer more we needed to all but eliminate risk
1803960 we then decided to do something no other esourcing provider would do k2 sourcing offered an unconditional money back performance guarantee on the esourcing platform
1803961 when smaller organizations feel ready we are here to help them understand and see first hand what esourcing can do for their business
1803962 it became apparent that given our rapidly growing hospitality business the role of the senior vice president should be based at our main hospitality office in california as a result of family commitments steve was not able to relocate to california after a thorough internal search i am very pleased to promote jo masters to an officer level position at the company jo brings a strong hospitality background to this position and extensive knowledge of the complexity of our global commercial business i would also like to thank steve for his many contributions to softbrands in his more than three years at the company steve played a major role in transforming our hospitality business from a small declining business into the vibrant business it is today
1803963 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1803964 you have to start with the recognition that most wells drilled in the rockies are not oil wells they are gas wells there would never be an expectation of huge returns on the oil side
1803965 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
1803966 because we are a frontier region its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
1803967 if you restrict drilling youll go from a situation where were growing one billion cubic feet in production a day to a situation where youre flat or declining in two years
1803968 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
1803969 there is obviously in the rockies a tremendous amount of industry investment it is reasonable to expect that surge will bear fruit with new production over the coming decade
1803970 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
1803971 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west
1803972 and then run some amps over to steve and derri to borrow for a couple weeks
1803973 the product is also enriched with essential oils which strengthen and sterilize hair resulting in a healthy shine
1803974 the fact is we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately i believe that its vital that we move forward with that solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1803975 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere this plan will not lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration
1803976 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1803977 mccain represents four more years of oil companies calling the shots after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1803978 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1803979 same genetic profile as a serial killer but hasnt previously acted on any homicidal impulses

1803983 we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter which was our largest revenue quarter in the companys history reflecting the impact of large group contracts in our hospitality business and strength in our consulting businesses
1803984 in addition both of our businesses contributed to our strong operating profit performance in the quarter
1803985 our manufacturing business delivered strong profitability in the quarter our sap business grew as a percentage of our total revenue but we are not yet at the point where our sap business is fully offsetting the natural attrition in our base business
1803986 in the fourth quarter we expect stronger license performance from the manufacturing business in fiscal 2009 we expect our manufacturing business to deliver top line growth as revenue growth accelerates in our sap business
1803987 our hospitality business posted its highest revenue quarter ever with double digit increases in license and professional services revenue
1803988 hospitalitys results included significant revenue from red roof inns which will continue to have a material positive impact on our results for the next nine to 12 months

1803990 we are also taking further action to adjust the operating model of the company consistent with our new structure the results of these efforts will become evident as we move forward in late 2008 and into 2009
1803991 do you have some prescriptive guidance for an individual team member who would like to evolve the the team and reclaim a code base that has trended toward entropy

1803996 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1803997 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1803998 they may not have hit a home run but at least they hit a triple
1803999 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1804000 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1804001 design essentials is all about the community and this is another way to serve those who support us

1804003 i dont mean to sound bitter cold or cruel but i am so thats how it comes out
1804004 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1804005 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi
1804006 today we primarily use our phones for communication information gathering and entertainment but lifecomm wants to transform our phones into in the hand toolsets that can help us maintain our good health or manage a condition we may already have

1804008 working with jahna industries was an absolute pleasure they are one of the most honorable and trustworthy companies i have ever done business with and if it were not for the lawyers we could have closed that deal on a handshake
1804009 ron johnson and corby myers approached me about their interest in the land and in a matter of one hour we made a deal and closed shortly thereafter these are good people and they represent one fine company
1804010 we are still working to complete our water and sewer permitting with water management and the state dep once complete we will be ready to start construction
1804011 how serious are the authorities in this war on crime and violence
1804012 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging
1804013 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years

1804016 the internet industry should by no means stand in the opposite camp against the music industry
1804017 google always believes profoundly that mutual interest rather than monopoly is the key to sustainable growth
1804018 it is disturbing for investors to do a convertible offering at these levels
1804019 general corporate purposes which may include among other things debt reduction
1804020 the companys still not out of the woods and things are likely to get worse before they get better
1804021 theres nothing to get overly excited about the company still faces significant challenges
1804022 we made progress in the quarter but were far from satisfied
1804023 were still not in a position to deliver sustained revenue and earnings growth weve not turned the corner yet i have been clear that this will take some time
1804024 realignment based on investments we want to make going forward
1804025 were still going through where all the new positions will land and so forth to make sure we continue to drive the business in sales marketing and technical support
1804026 we continue to invest in smb and in our highest growth areas within our product divisions this is a realignment to continue to grow the business
1804027 its business as usual we feel strong about our position in the market
1804028 all computer systems are intrinsically flawed and can only ever have a transitory utility if you place faith in computerized systems its asking for trouble
1804029 the madness of our particular age is the delusion that our world can be controlled and managed by using the pseudo science of technology this is the madness of control freaks
1804030 control freaks dont appreciate that their actions trigger an uncertainty principle pointing mathematical insights at complexity in a non linear world can only create more complexity
1804031 when you treat similarity as sameness and assume that all comparisons between are absolute facts then you have a problem
1804032 the trouble is we are trapped because thats what human beings do categories are our way of differentiating meaning
1804033 putting data on a computer amplifies the errors numbers are like people torture them enough and they will tell you anything
1804034 but whenever we make a database and categorize we always introduce uncertainty
1804035 of course there are benefits but we must remember that technology is part of the problem not the solution

1804039 it was an obstruction of such character as to leave no doubt in my mind as to our future proceedings for we might as well sail through the cliffs of dover as to penetrate such a mass it would be impossible to conceive a more solid looking mass of ice not the smallest appearance of any rent or fissure could we discover throughout its whole extent and the intensely bright sky beyond it but too plainly indicated the great distance to which it reached southward

1804054 silvia una scrittrice che vive sola per scelta e non ha mai sofferto per amore la sua esistenza non conforme ai clich libera e piena di soddisfazione viene travolta allimprovviso da un abbandono marcello luomo che riuscito a farle provare emozioni totali si allontana senza spiegazione o forse con decine di spiegazioni plausibili che si confondono e perdono consistenza di fronte al silenzio e al niente di giorni vuoti e silvia cade nel baratro della depressione nonostante la presenza di unamica sincera e di un uomo che incontrato su un aereo la coinvolge in una relazione di amicizia dalle tinte fortemente erotiche il suo amore per marcello era socialmente sbagliato un amore che nessuno potrebbe approvare eppure il dolore assoluto e profondo questa storia la visione dellamore dal punto di vista di chi apparentemente usurpa e perde ma anche un calarsi nel quotidiano orrore della depressione senza aiuto depressione che pu cogliere anche la donna pi forte e realizzata come uno scherzo brutale della vita contro il quale impossibile difendersi
1804055 always show a link to the posts feed when diplaying a post
1804056 i f a 501 c 3 organization posts something on its web site that favors or opposes a candidate for public office the organization will be treated the same as if it distributed printed material oral statements or broadcasts that favored or opposed a candidate
1804057 w hen an organization establishes a link to another web site the organization is responsible for the consequences of establishing and maintaining that link even if the organization does not have control over the content of the linked site
1804058 will focus on analyzing the content around a link in the unrelated organization cases and not pursue at this time cases involving a link between the web site of a section 501 c 3 organization and the home page of a web site operated by a related section 501 c 4 organization
1804059 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1804060 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1804061 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1804062 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1804063 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1804064 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
1804065 right now weve already got a camera working it works very well with computers its just how to connect the camera to the brain that is the issue to be solved
1804066 how do you grieve and also be there for your children
1804067 because i know that she is completely whole because of my faith i know that shes completely whole and completely okay and im going to see her again
1804068 weve talked a lot and youll hear all of us talk about the process of grieving with hope thats such for what has kept us breathing kept us alive is that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
1804069 ive gotten a stronger faith through all of this but then theres those days you know that just hit you and youre just like oh man this is just awful you just got to continue to choose to live and thats the faith that you know that continues to keep me going
1804070 my son said the other day that you now we are a family and a lot of people say of great faith but were a family with a lot of questions but thats what faith is
1804071 we could just get a lot of people just showing up to camp
1804072 people from out of state if they found out that we were going to open up free camping in the park would say hey we can actually go to the dnc and stay for free
1804073 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there

1804075 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer

1804082 five years ago i survived a battle with cancer and now we have another battle on our hands in july i was given the news from my doctors that another form of cancer has appeared over the last few weeks i have begun radiation and chemotherapy treatments and therefore i will not be around the office at 1 jarvis st and out in the community as much as i have been in the past the goal is to get this taken care of and move forward just like i did five years ago we will approach this the same way and i thank you all in advance for your kindness as i am on my path to recovery

1804091 yeah and what are you going to do about it
1804092 so what was the best part of the day for you

1804094 were excited to bring gabriel on board as we head into the final stretch of the season
1804095 gabriel has proven himself in a number of leagues that he is a very complete defender and we are confident that he will make an immediate impact
1804096 i think were obviously adding a quality player who brings another dimension and further options to our attack as we enter the final third of the season and playoff push
1804097 he has had a lot of success in this league and we look forward to having him for many good years in columbus
1804098 i am excited at the opportunity to return to mls and especially to join the columbus crew i think it will be a great fit and i look forward to helping a team that is in a great spot to make a run for an mls title

1804101 jesus died too so she must be jesus kitty now
1804102 this contains code to prepare for future growth of the service
1804103 he is detained in a holding cell at hong kong airport
1804104 it is my understanding that he has refused to be put on an airplane back to
1804105 he has demanded his right as a chinese citizen with a valid chinese passport under the chinese constitution and also article 12 of the un covenant for civil and human rights which china is a signatory to be able to continue his humanitarian mission on mainland china
1804106 i am a chinese citizen and i have every right to enter my country
1804107 unfortunately this is not an isolated case many hundreds if not thousands of my countrymen are denied the right of return
1804108 many of them have had their passports illegally confiscated this is an issue that must addressed by the international community
1804109 we were disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa
1804110 the grandmother becomes very emotional when she is told that the child cannot be taken out of india the lawmakers will have to find some solution for this
1804111 this groove is out of fashion these beats are twenty years old
1804112 the conditions are not unfavourable at the moment and my understanding is that we are not going to be taking any extra measures
1804113 the conditions are really tough with the pollution and its really hot we dont have too many days to adapt so i hope to be much better than today
1804114 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1804115 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1804116 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1804117 the cognitive load did not however decrease the proportion of utilitarian judgments as the dual process model predicts people were just as likely to approve of smothering the baby even if it took them a little bit longer to make that judgment
1804118 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1804119 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1804120 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1804121 and his view that nothing should be done unilaterally by either side to alter the status quo on beijing he faces a delicate balancing act
1804122 sen mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists
1804123 the candidates are responding to the fact that the public is hurting and crying for relief
1804124 i dont do things i would normally do right now
1804125 politically i think its the only domestic economically leaning issue where the republicans have a slight opportunity even advantage because of the trend in support for even greater exploration
1804126 i would have to lean more toward mccain with this offshore drilling
1804127 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1804128 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1804129 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1804130 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1804131 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1804132 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1804133 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up
1804134 as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1804135 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now
1804136 baseless smears about a muslim with a very good reputation was used to marginalize not only him but the community from the political process
1804137 if someone like mr asbahi cant be vetted to work for the obama campaign then who can
1804138 you know i hope that i and all americans can be colorblind about any president
1804139 makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country
1804140 im not home a lot so michelle is usually willing to give it up
1804141 the only time i grab for the remote is when a game is on
1804142 sometimes i win the arm wrestling contest but foolishly she continues to try to assert her control over the remote
1804143 this is a battle that will continue for a long time
1804144 but they can still hang with spongebob squarepants and i have to say spongebob is pretty funny
1804145 remembering back to the last time this occurred theres something a little disturbing about 200 000 germans chanting their support for a charismatic leader in the streets of berlin
1804146 what i really meant by saying the surge wouldnt work
1804147 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the election
1804148 adam thought it would be really funny to get paris to respond to the john mccain ad that featured her
1804149 adam contacted paris directly and she agreed to do it he wrote the sketch and she really really loved it
1804150 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1804151 because she decided she just wanted to do it for fun
1804152 doesnt look like all those other presidents on dollar bills
1804153 when obama says hell only tax the rich hes saying he will only tax the engine room not the rest of the ship
1804154 carl has been with us in the trenches in our fight against illegal immigration from prop 200 to the minutemen you can count on carl to walk the walk i also know that carl will be a conservative voice for fiscal restraint and a champion for traditional family values we need him at the capitol thats why he has my support and i urge you to give him yours as well
1804155 come together to agree on how to accommodate californias growth
1804156 it is also the first time in the country that the issues of land use transportation housing and climate change have been brought together in a comprehensive piece of legislation
1804157 this is about creating an environment to continue to make things happen in indigenous affairs
1804158 the three of us have never been in the one room together but we are like minded in our thoughts about how to drive change in indigenous affairs
1804159 during the cold war the principal objection in the united states to a nuclear weapon free world was that you could not get there
1804160 if the nuclear powers wish to be safe from nuclear weapons
1804161 they must surrender their own then we will all work together to assure that everyone abides by the commitment
1804162 then we will all work together to assure that everyone abides by the commitment
1804163 if people with racial power want not to live in fear they better surrender their racial privilege for their own sake and the future for the planet
1804164 lessen our racial power and make us less afraid of black people
1804165 we should ensure all these people be evacuated to safe places in order to guarantee the peoples lives
1804166 we took the initiative to open up the mausoleum to hundreds of samarra residents who came to visit
1804167 we deployed our troops to protect the site and thankfully everything went well
1804168 in negotiations with the german government the claims conference has secured payments for certain jewish survivors of the nazi occupation of budapest
1804169 in recognition of the incarceration and suffering of budapest holocaust survivors certain jewish survivors of nazi era budapest who currently reside in eastern europe and previously did not receive any payments from certain major compensation programs will receive a one time payment of 1 900 euros a3 200 from the claims conference budapest fund
1804170 these payments mean a historical recognition of the horrible fate of budapest jewry during the nazi persecution
1804171 streamline the process and distribute the funds as quickly as possible the claims conference has reviewed over 25 000 files to identify eligible survivors
1804172 people are also happy with dvd because the quality and convenience jump from vhs to dvd was far greater
1804173 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1804174 we have a responsibility to the taxpayer and to the overall financial system to thoroughly analyze and understand these authorities should circumstances ever warrant their use
1804175 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1804176 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1804177 we have been talking to rhys yes but as yet nothing is finalised
1804178 i have heard rumours he has decided to leave but i havent heard anything for certain
1804179 we want to end the series well we want to make it 3 0
1804180 when we hold up the trophy at the end of this test match it will be nice if we can have played really well here at the oval
1804181 hes got a once off test match against us and hell obviously be hugely motivated hell be excited hell be nervous and hell have a lot of energy
1804182 its about sustaining that afterwards for us the best way to keep him under pressure is to beat england like we did to michael vaughan we kept him on the back foot in terms of his performance and as a captain you know that pressure grows very quickly
1804183 hes always been a very single minded guy he backs his ability and a lot of the time he comes off hes become a really top class cricketer
1804184 its going to be interesting now that hes been thrown a lot of curve balls
1804185 as captain you have to have an open mind you arrive at a stadium and there are so many different things to challenge you on any given day its not only about your own performance
1804186 have agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
1804187 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran and its failure to meet the deadline set by the unscr 1803 the p5 1 are discussing the next steps in the unsc and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanction resolution
1804188 have agreed that while informal contacts between mr solana and mr iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
1804189 our objective is not sanctions for the sake of sanctions
1804190 we have to resort to the security council sanctions if we dont see theres any possibility to enter into a dialogue
1804191 but we are getting closer to the point where we will make that determination
1804192 if iran does not choose this path the un security council will be referred to once again
1804193 we would have preferred a clear yes but it is more complicated than that

1804221 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1804222 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1804223 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up
1804224 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1804225 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when you received your partys nomination

1804267 a sense of how important an mwbe program was to him
1804268 i dont want to put words in anybodys mouth i cant remember a conversation like that
1804269 we agree with betsy gotbaum whose investigations have found that the city just isnt getting the job done for women and minority businesses

1804278 we cannot afford to have a workforce with inadequate knowledge and skills otherwise we will fail to exploit a global market that is increasingly dependent on the knowledge economy
1804279 therefore it is imperative for our survival as a nation that we produce those with the right skills and the right knowledge

1804361 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1804362 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1804363 theyre killers that live in mexico who want to challenge the government who want to use terror in the form of beheading

1804380 that its beneficial to girls and makes no difference to boys that is young women benefit from it while young men are not affected one way or the other i think for some young women not having to compete with men in the classroom brings out leadership qualities in them that might otherwise go undeveloped
1804381 always co educational there was never a single sex school available even my junior high home ec class had a few boys in it
1804382 hard to say i think seeing males rewarded caused me to identify more with them at times than the girls in my classes i also think i was sometimes distracted by boys romantically and how i looked around them or behaved around them when there were better things i could have been doing with my time
1804383 i suspect i would have been a better student in a single sex setting and that i would have felt less pressure to hide my intelligence in class
1804384 as a woman i prefer teaching at a womens college i like the dedication to educating women and the curricular focus on women whenever possible i find myself giving students kinds of classes i wish i had been offered
1804385 nothing comes to mind unless it was something she would have failed in any setting
1804386 i think so in any class you have some students who are more talkative than others but in an all female class all the talkative people are women it would be hard to say definitively unless i observed the same student in both environments

1804402 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers
1804403 we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough
1804404 after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
1804405 the predators enjoy a feast of aphids early in the season and lay many more eggs but by the time they hatch later in the season much of the damage has been done
1804406 we think the trend over the next 50 years will be for a 10 fold increase in aphid numbers

1804409 our findings take the early history of milk use back to the seventh millennium bc early in the evolution of animal domestication and pottery production and use

1804419 and they made cuts in it which didnt surprise me at all they have an editor they edit but they took out a verse about the caesars where i say you know they were sleeping with their sisters stashing little boys in swimming pools and burning down the city what are they protecting tiberius its like these people have been dead 2 000 years i mean theyre not going to you know kevin caesar isnt going to come out of the woodwork and sue em i mean what difference does it make
1804420 but you know what ive been giving my opinions too much
1804421 in interviews ive been doing all of a sudden ive turned into like warren beatty like an activist or something i used to hate it when show biz people would be commenting on issues but the way things have gone with this administration its in your face all the time its so noisy that you almost cant avoid talking about it with people
1804422 you know the old saying its a curse to live in interesting times well in a way that applies in this situation its much more interesting to me to examine an individual character or something
1804423 cool and wet weather conditions improves the snails success at breeding and of course you are more likely to see them when the weather is cool and wet as it has been this year
1804424 barely walk to the front gate without the familiar sound of snails crunching underfoot
1804425 it is mainly down to the weather that people will see an increase in snails and there is very little they can do about it except their usual methods of pest control
1804426 they are a problem for gardeners particularly in the spring when they eat the young shoots and plants that are just starting to grow and are at their most vulnerable by the time you get to late summer the plants have done most of their growing so snails are not so much a problem
1804427 if scattered on the ground it wont have much effect on a snail but might be detrimental to the garden soil and plants
1804428 cheaters evade detection innocents are falsely accused and sport is ultimately suffering

1804431 with 126 samples taken in the tour de france assuming 99 per cent specificity the false positive rate is 72 per cent so an apparently unusual test result may not be unusual at all when viewed from the perspective of multiple tests
1804432 this is well understood by statisticians who routinely adjust for multiple testing
1804433 to various degrees these same deficiencies exist elsewhere including in some forensic laboratories
1804434 labs must have stringent criteria and processes for concluding doping but before they can be used in an actual case the process criteria must be validated we need to know the proportions of non dopers concluded to be positive false positive rate and we need to know the proportion of dopers concluded to be positive sensitivity
1804435 i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners account for tibetans who have disappeared since the protests in march and engage in meaningful dialogue and genuine autonomy for tibet
1804436 but it does no service to the chinese government and certainly no service to the people of china for the united states and other democracies to pretend that the suppression of rights in china does not concern us it does will and must concern us
1804437 the emergence of an economically vibrant more politically active china offers new opportunities for prosperity and cooperation
1804438 as president i intend to forge a more effective regional framework in asia that will promote stability prosperity and help us confront common transnational threats such as tracking down terrorists and responding to global health problems like avian flu
1804439 we need to watch with interest and perhaps increasingly with concern its military program
1804440 but we cant assume that that inevitably foreshadows military confrontation with china you could create a self fulfilling prophecy there which would be unnecessary and antithetical to our national security interests

1804445 he didnt hunt fish or go to the bar with the boys at least not as far as i know
1804446 but he could go on for hours about some guy from fresno who was coming to the state fair no matter what you talked to him about it always came back to golf
1804447 no one and i mean no one gave more to golf than frank freer
1804448 outside of his family he lived for one thing and that was the state fair every year other than that i dont think he did anything but go to the golf course and look around
1804449 theres no way he can get this within 20 feet of the hole

1804474 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1804475 they may not have hit a home run but at least they hit a triple
1804476 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1804477 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1804478 we can only trust that the next subjects will include cooks tailors and cobblers without whose support terrorist leaders would be left unfed unclothed and unshod and therefore rendered incapable of planning or executing their attacks

1804535 the reality is we cant afford 14 teams and we cant fit a 14 team round robin into the competition window

1804583 the fccs new policy sanctioning fleeting expletives is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act for failing to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy
1804584 a n an agency must be afforded great latitude to change its policies but it must justify its actions by articulating a reasoned analysis behind the change
1804585 the agencys obligation to supply a reasoned analysis for a policy departure requires an affirmative showing on record
1804586 so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise

1804608 previous geas simulations with significantly less data and cross validation correctly forecasted the most surprising species collapses of the past decade sciurus carolinenis and sciurus vulgaris for example and the anatidae chen so we have very good reason to believe that these simulation results while shocking do accurately represent the rapidly growing threats to the viability of the human species

1804638 introversion returns to spill the beans on what happened when all of the hangovers camera crews excitement and hype surrounding igf dissipated we will discuss the trials and tribulations of running a small independent games company including topics such as advice on how to attain commercial credibility and compete with the big boys of the games industry whilst retaining creative freedom maximizing the benefits whilst downplaying the limitations of running a small dev team tapping in to the opportunities now present to indies via internet retail and distribution why now is a better time than ever for the budding independent developer

1804641 but ive seen worse if it really was as bad as you say youve made progress also the it band in your left leg does seem to be a problem but i think whats really the matter is your left quad you have some tenderness and weakness right here
1804642 you say this is the spot where you hurt yourself during a 10k run well i think the muscle hasnt fully healed and thats causing all of the other problems its causing the it band syndrome and everything else
1804643 do you see how your right leg is stronger than your left leg
1804644 your body is out of balance your left quad hasnt fully recovered its still a little sore a little weak and thats throwing everything else off balance when we run there are many different systems that have to work in concert with each other if one of them is off it throws everything else off a sore quad can ruin your bio mechanics

1804649 its very possible that youre running too slow people have natural running paces just like they have natural walking paces
1804650 i didnt know that but it makes sense when im on my own i have a fast pace that i fall into about 9 10 and a normal pace about 10 30 i cant make myself run as slow as we do in training
1804651 and i think that when you do you might actually be forcing your body to do things that seem unnatural you may want to consider moving up to a faster training group or maybe you should just run on your own
1804652 no running for a couple of weeks you can bike if you want or walk or better yet swim but no running okay
1804653 i guess that kind of puts running the marathon on hold but maybe i can walk it
1804654 ive started running again but by myself its not as fun but

1804692 other positive national effects of the proposed projects significant use of wind energy include the implications for matters such as new zealands future ability to fulfill its ever increasing energy demands
1804693 project hayes is a matter of national significance because there is widespread public interest in regard to its likely effect on the environment it involves significant use of natural and physical resources and it has effects on more than one district or region

1804708 the question is whether this incident needs to be enshrined in permanent regulation or whether it indicates that the market actually works to protect legitimate consumer interests in the absence of regulation i think its the latter
1804709 this points to how corporations silently degrade their products shoppers beware products shrink but prices stay the same
1804710 as economists use the term price discrimination means charging some buyers more than others for essentially the same product or service is it a bad thing buyers paying the higher prices understandably resent the practice they might thus be surprised to learn that it often enables them to enjoy both lower prices and higher quality than would be possible if sellers charged the same price to everyone even more surprising price discrimination often metes out rough justice among buyers requiring those who are responsible for a greater share of sellers costs to shoulder a greater share of the burden

1804760 i deal with anything that has to do with family in particular anything that helps families make consumer choices
1804761 food safety and food preservation thats where extension has its niche
1804762 some days you come in and do planning for programs or you might come in and some major thing has happened and youve got calls coming in like when the powers out and people are calling to see if its still safe to keep their food
1804763 she understands how easy it is to slip away from an exercise routine

1804773 asvab is well known as an aptitude screen for military enlistment
1804774 feel that the test is a recruiting tool they and their families are hesitant about taking it
1804775 students werent coming to school on the day of the asvab they were uncomfortable taking the test
1804776 the program is most important to students to give them choices to let them see what kind of opportunities are out there what their skills and abilities are

1804784 if you go to the asvab career exploration web site they dont mention even what the acronym stands for
1804785 we havent changed the name or disguised the name of the program
1804786 taking the sats or acts for college prep kids this is a similar test for a trade union or an apprenticeship program
1804787 kids are afraid to take the test because they are afraid they might have to go into the military and thats not the case at all
1804788 we warn them that the recruiters may be calling them we say if youre not interested ignore them
1804789 children do not need to be made to learn to be better told what to do or shown how if they are given access to enough of the world they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others and they will make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else could make for them

1805056 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions
1805057 none of that serves the victims their families or the public likewise we will not discuss reports or details on the timing of briefings to the public or victims and their families we will provide such details to the press at the appropriate time and not before

1805063 any standards that are applied to groups based on race any jobs where there are different standards for admissions

1805084 web 2 0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the internet as platform and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform
1805085 a journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step
1805086 a slowdown is probably wise and prudent given the circumstances
1805087 the echelon delay certainly improves the prospects for citycenter now they have at least a two year head start
1805088 they are still moving forward but i think that fontainebleau could have some trouble
1805089 i dont solicit all this press coverage the press finds me i think that the press finds me because im colorful im not shy i have an opinion and i frankly really dont care if someone agrees or disagrees with it im willing to share
1805090 the controversy the invective that i get comes primarily from the games industry people always writing me emails and asking me what do you think about this
1805091 i publish my monthly console and handheld hardware numbers because the neogaf guys think its so fun
1805092 but no ones ever asked to see my annual forecast for all those things im spot on for my annual forecast id love to see those guys put out a contest for annual forecasts for the next five years and then well compare my numbers to theirs because ive been spot on for five or six years now
1805093 the average neogaf visitor isnt equipped to actually prepare those things
1805094 because it requires you to make an assumption about pricing and ive been great on that as well its hard to do
1805095 i love the innovation i love the opportunistic rapid market response i think this companys going to earn a lot more money than most people do
1805096 im just making an economic argument not so much a suggestion
1805097 prices of next gen games arent going up youre seeing collectors editions at 70 youre seeing the gta collectors at 90 guitar hero 90 people dont even blink they stand in line for the thing
1805098 i just meant that the public is willing to spend more for the content that they want
1805099 again adjusted for inflation the old psone game in 1995 that came out at 49 99 would be probably about 70 bucks right now just at 3 percent inflation compounded for the last 12 years youd be up over 70 on an apples to apples basis 60 is a bargain and the content of a ps3 game is a lot greater or an xbox 360 game than the content of the first generation psone games
1805100 the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1805101 i believe we must assess a governing power not by what it says it is or by what it intends but by what it does
1805102 the time has come to recognize that the antitrust approach has been a failure the costs it imposes far exceed any benefits it brings
1805103 some of the resources devoted to extracting its secrets could be turned to other tasks to other foreign targets but some of those foreign targets had a domestic tinge as topics like international narcotics trafficking terrorism alien smuggling and russian organized crime rose in priority for the intelligence community it became harder to distinguish betweeen targets of law enforcement and those of national security
1805104 few foresaw any danger in nibbling a bit at the principle that intelligence and law enforcement must remain separate undertakings
1805105 today the risk to civil liberties is largely theoretical however theoretical those risks may be they cannot be ignored one of my offices jobs at the agency was to review requests for intlligence from drug enforcement agencies in some cases we suspected they were trying to shortcut constitutional or statutory limits and their requests were denied but i have no illusions that our objections would have prevailed if a different message had been coming from the leaders of the agency and the government

1805121 el sistema de la comisi n militar es un proceso legal justo y apropiado para el procedimiento de alegato de los detenidos que han cometido cr menes en contra de estados unidos o sus intereses estamos esperando que otros casos vayan a juicio
1805122 cualquier veredicto resultante de tal defectuoso sistema traiciona los valores estadounidenses las reglas para la comisi n militar de guant namo est n tan equivocadas que la justicia nunca ser entregada desde el principio hasta el final ste ha sido un desastre monumental para la justicia estadounidense

1805139 ill look at carl when i say this and he can slap me if he wants
1805140 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year tony stewart with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1805141 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1805142 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1805143 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1805144 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1805145 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1805146 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1805147 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1805148 in april each of you worked on a project in iearn the deadline was april 30 visions of me self portraits
1805149 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1805150 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1805151 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1805152 this shows the world that they have no hearts in america
1805153 claim ed that pc games are on the way out killed by the threat of easy piracy
1805154 im not prepared to offer an opinion one way or the other
1805155 that doesnt necessarily prove that piracy was the primary factor but it certainly could be part of the explanation
1805156 even the most tech savvy among us should be sure to investigate the technical aspects of what we see online before leaping to conclusions
1805157 the internet in general and blogging in particular makes it far too easy for even very thoughtful and sophisticated observers like richard to jump to conclusions quickly

1805186 i was like where the heck did he get that squeegee at i thought maybe he stopped at a gas station on the way to the track it was funny
1805187 if you worry about it youll perform worse most of the time
1805188 i went off track a couple of times but the car was fast and hopefully well have the same type of car this weekend
1805189 the last five races and ever since we won the pole in loudon its given us a little bit more confidence and now were running top 20 a little bit more
1805190 im starting to battle with the cup drivers a little bit more where i couldnt early on out there
1805191 you still have to be smooth but you can enter a corner as late as you want and just abuse the car i think you need a little bit more finesse with a stock car than you do with an indy car otherwise you will just burn everything up
1805192 you have to let the car do what it wants
1805193 thats the biggest thing ive learned im still learning every race that we go to every track that i race on im still learning a little bit more and more
1805194 things dont happen so fast as when youre in an indy car
1805195 even at an oval track like las vegas i was coming down the straightaway and i would snap sideways with the car but on a road course things happen a little bit more slowly
1805196 in school we ought to concentrate on writing reading and arithmetic

1805198 educational programs to students in any of grades k 12
1805199 his brand of cricket is going to have to change with the style of play that he wants the team to play
1805200 you can do those things until you bump your head and the pressures on and you need to win series and win tests
1805201 knowing the man like i think we do hes going to be trying to prove to everybody that he can
1805202 but for him its going to be about finding the balance where he can marry the two of his captaincy and batting
1805203 i think theres certainly a lot more responsibility in terms of having to walk the walk with your team
1805204 you are always asking a lot of your players demanding a lot from their performances and thinking and you have to do that yourself that will come in time
1805205 its in time when you need to sustain your success
1805206 he has some tough challenges ahead hes got to develop a team pretty quickly and decide on what his style of play will be

1805225 everything from very low end user costs for being able to participate lots and lots and lots of listening to users having them involved having them contribute
1805226 weve all heard it and probably even said it games are kind of like movies we have the blockbusters the opening days the big budgets and interdisciplinary teams there are many lessons we can learn from the well established content industries but games are also software and the software world is undergoing a revolution the web world is in ferment some say a new bubble and its dragging content industries kicking and screaming into the 21st century the underlying technological assumptions of the web regarding concepts such as ip distribution and user participation are very different from the big media way of doing things could release early release often possibly apply to the world of gamemaking this session is about lessons we can learn from how the web world works applied to the game industry and concrete takeaways on how to leverage the brave new web world

1805228 what are the companies collecting who are they sharing it with how long do they store it and what control does the consumer have over the information these are the fundamental questions
1805229 first no one is forcing you to buy the phones equipped with lbs or purchase download these technologies
1805230 the only scenario i could imagine is if a stalker purchased a lbs equipped phone activated the service signed up for loopt or some other lbs service and then threw the phone in the car trunk of the person they wanted to track
1805231 from a policy perspective a la carte regulation is worse than a solution in search of a problem it is a problem waiting to happen

1805242 how would all those beat downs have affected his longevity keeping in mind that being batman means never losing if you look at consecutive events where professional fighters have to defend their titles muhammad ali george foreman ultimate fighters the longest period youre going to find is about two to three years that dovetails nicely with the average career for nfl running backs its about three years thats the statistic i got from the nfl players association web site the point is its not very long its really hard to become batman in the first place and its hard to maintain it when you get there
1805243 find what it is that your competition feels is beneath them to do thats where the business is and thats always where the dough resides
1805244 but when it comes to new business prospecting small business people and consultants make a huge mistake by only going after the big kill the contract everyone is fighting over meanwhile theres smaller business hiding in crevices out there that you can take to the bank the small potatoes fill you up my friend think about it its out there
1805245 one afternoon i was driving along the highway and noticed a work crew along the side of the road there was one guy supervising them it made me think hey maybe those supervisors need training when i got home i visited the states web site and sure enough there was an rfp for management training of the states road crew supervisors i did a proposal went to see em and got a years contract and you know what they told me they had trouble finding a professional who would take it on

1805270 58 of canucks think humans evolved from less advanced life forms over millions of years and 22 believe god created people in their present form within the last 10 000 years
1805271 a majority of canadians believe in the theory of evolution
1805272 public discontent with classical evolution as an inclusive theory stems partly from an intuitive appreciation of its limits
1805273 its an opportunity for a lot of guys you look at guys who have not won majors who are my age or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
1805274 if you look at the world rankings from fifth to 20th theres a lot of guys very bunched and playing very good golf there are so many guys that can win this week
1805275 ive had quite a few second places quite a few thirds and top fives so quite a few chances
1805276 but i think tiger a lot of times has just been way better
1805277 i remember in 2000 finishing second three times and twice to him in majors
1805278 i feel ive still got quite a few years left so ive got to keep pushing away
1805279 i get criticised in south africa a lot more than i get over here its something that ive had to live with for a while if tiger woods wasnt around i probably would have won a couple more majors but i dont feel like im done yet
1805280 ive got a very good feel about the golf course
1805281 my swing is in pretty good shape and i feel excited about this week i feel like i have a reasonably good chance at making a good showing and hopefully i have a chance on sunday
1805282 this is a big week because right now my season with just a couple with just two wins is i think just ok
1805283 but if i were to able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1805284 i love the pga championship it is my favorite major
1805285 im a golf course owner and i feel like this tournament is the heart and soul of the pga and im just proud to be a part of it
1805286 these are probably some of the toughest greens youll ever see and a lot of slope a lot of undulation
1805287 you get above the hole very fast and then obviously the rough is up
1805288 so the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should be so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
1805289 they will not appear in the story if you ask about his son theyll stop the car and drop you on the fucking 405
1805290 i play a complicated position in an intensely team oriented game a basketball player has to play defense im not even on the field half the time
1805291 being in the system ive been in for eight years with the same coach and the same offense when we call a play ive run it hundreds of times peyton and i share that when you practice an entire nfl season thats 123 practices a hundred and twenty three practices with sixty plays a practice you know thats six thou thats a lot of plays and then you have all the game situations and thats another eight nine hundred plays a season so i know where all those mistakes come in i mean beat i have a memory and i can just eliminate mistakes when they come up because ive already made them
1805292 we all have experiences in our lives that change us and we all learn from people like my dad but at the end of the day its only us and were only responsible to make ourselves happy too often in life something happens and we blame other people for us not being happy or satisfied or fulfilled so the point is we all have choices and we make the choice to accept people or situations or to not accept situations if someone lies well you had a choice to trust that person or not i think the way my father raised me well he trusted everybody and that worked for him
1805293 over the last whatever fifteen years of my life that doesnt make me as happy
1805294 when i was eighteen and i was way down on the depth chart i would blame everybody id blame the weather id blame my coach and how they put me in with the third string guys it was never internal
1805295 until i understood that im the reason why im in this position i couldnt fight my way out of it
1805296 to try and win a major and to earn a lot of points for the ryder cup
1805297 im here to try to win try to play my best and hope thats good enough at the end of the week
1805298 but its much longer than in 2004 and the rough is thicker
1805299 any time youre playing a course where theyve had u s opens its a great experience definitely playing out here is different than playing most courses a different kind of experience
1805300 its the heartbeat that pumps life into our facility hosting the u s amateur reminds us of the fundamental value as an ambassador of golf as a lifelong game
1805301 we might have to back off of the firm and fast a little bit
1805302 its hot its humid its sticky its wet theyre all going to play the same golf course and it isnt going to be like the golf courses weve all seen in the u s open a little bit softer a little bit slower but it will be the same on monday as it would be on sunday that is one thing that all the competitors can expect consistency
1805303 hunter called my office last week and left a message and asked to meet with us this week and personally apologize
1805304 he started out by saying i made a mistake said some things that were wrong and ive learned from my mistake and apologize
1805305 weve now combined the welcome dinner on tuesday with the gala dinner on wednesday so those were old issues that were brought up
1805306 i dont care where he heard them from and i think if he makes the team hunter will probably feel very differently about it
1805307 i talked to him and told him i dont take those comments personally
1805308 hes apologized to the pga of america done all of the things hes needed to do to try to correct what was a little bit of a faux paux
1805309 its an opportunity for a lot of guys you look at guys who have not won majors who are my age or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
1805310 if you look at the world rankings from fifth to 20th theres a lot of guys very bunched and playing very good golf there are so many guys that can win this week
1805311 ive had quite a few second places quite a few thirds and top fives so quite a few chances
1805312 but i think tiger a lot of times has just been way better
1805313 i remember in 2000 finishing second three times and twice to him in majors
1805314 i feel ive still got quite a few years left so ive got to keep pushing away
1805315 i get criticized in south africa a lot more than i get over here its something that ive had to live with for a while if tiger woods wasnt around i probably would have won a couple more majors but i dont feel like im done yet
1805316 ive got a very good feel about the golf course
1805317 my swing is in pretty good shape and i feel excited about this week i feel like i have a reasonably good chance at making a good showing and hopefully i have a chance on sunday
1805318 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1805319 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
1805320 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
1805321 to try and win a major and to earn a lot of points for the ryder cup
1805322 im here to try to win try to play my best and hope thats good enough at the end of the week
1805323 but its much longer than in 2004 and the rough is thicker
1805324 to my surprise i have learnt that our contracts will be extended thus we will still work under contracts
1805325 most of these people foreigners take anything that come their way which makes our work cumbersome when trying to take management to task regarding our grievances
1805326 cannot claim to represent all teachers as others belong to other trade unions
1805327 bosetu advises all teachers to ignore such letters as they may be fake or the work of a conman
1805328 the union has met bec twice recently to discuss the conditions at the marking centres and the remuneration that the union wants teachers paid
1805329 the union is therefore investigating the origins and authenticity of the letter if the letter turns out to be genuine this will be a case of negotiating in bad faith by bec
1805330 and we have never entered into any negotiations whatsoever with bosetu our duty is only to consult with our various stakeholders including bosetu
1805331 we have been having meetings with bosetu to hear their thoughts sic on how the allowances and wages can be improved but some of these things might need a consultant to look into
1805332 we are still consulting as to whether bosetu can be recognised as a negotiator even the likes of bopeu are yet to be considered as negotiators
1805333 concentrate on making fall out 3 a fantastic single player experience

1805343 ocorrem mais congestionamentos de tr nsito mais acidentes aumenta o custo do estacionamento e deixa sem op es quem n o tem carro

1805346 you hear people say our universe is fine tuned for life that stars are rare and couldnt form if certain things were different
1805347 the right way to do the problem is to start from scratch
1805348 you have to turn all the knobs and find out what happens
1805349 you can change alpha or the gravitational constant by a factor of 100 and stars still form
1805350 you have no idea what life would be like in a universe with different constants
1805351 ive long had a suspicion that this talk of fine tuning needs constant questioning and re examination
1805352 its sometimes hard to recognise that living somewhere else in a different way might be just as easy

1805355 i who am the statistical average in the great accounting
1805356 with a fierce and youthful fervor perhaps even the first of his life
1805357 now rysio wrote unpunctuated amorphous prose played adjunct to hubert and was a venerable figure in the literary world
1805358 dont talk to me like youre just one of the guys when you dont use fucking commas and periods when you write
1805359 if you used punctuation then maybe we wouldnt need show deaths in this country
1805360 sin has assumed the form of virtue amorality rules us using moralitys laws it uses moral nomenclature it constructs its own positive systems it re wards saintliness and hurls the damned in to hell evil has tapped into our ethical code and turned itself into good a fatal cancerous good
1805361 spent his entire professional life making artists rot in jail now that he was retired he had suddenly begun to envy his victims and had taken up painting himself on every canvas there was a young naked woman with her pussy prudishly painted out
1805362 his guests were also men of distinction generals from the security police governors high officials from the censorship vice ministers they too had become part of the artistic elite they were writing memoirs and sensationalistic novels carving tree roots composing hit tunes and sculpting busts of their colleagues who had passed away any of their children who did not wish a career in politics were placed in art schools and so now the regime had its own art the regime is self sufficient it creates reality and mirrors it in art
1805363 that is local gossip incidental more important is konwickis examination of the tensions both tragic and comic generated by a situation where conscience demands sacrifice and reality offers no hope that the sacrifice will be of any value or significance
1805364 i have created a theory of how allusions function in a socialist society the tension caused by the hunger for truth those dangerous tensions are artificially eliminated by a skillfully employed allusion after a certain amount of time people will prefer an allusion to the truth itself
1805365 what color gas can do you want theres a choice red yellow or blue
1805366 poetry must be a violent assault against the unknown forces in order to overcome them and prostrate them before men
1805367 about the accident itself i can say very little almost nothing it involved something falling from the sky technology parts bits thats it really all i can divulge not much i know
1805368 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1805369 which will come to an end upon the holding of the general election preparatory to the introduction of the new democratic constitution

1805371 who in the course of upholding or opposing the aims and policies of the government of zimbabwe zanu pf or either formation of the mdc may have committed crimes within zimbabwe
1805372 homegrown solutions for zimbabweans now we are selling in liters gallons not in dollars
1805373 where coupons become a currency it reflects the rapidly falling value of the zimbabwe dollar barter selling provides something that holds its value
1805374 i think people were more sanguine about spending 100 new dollars instead of a trillion old dollars it doesnt feel so bad
1805375 the last thing he did in november 1957 was to write up a press release describing a riot that took place at elgin when the enlisted men attacked the womens quarters and the officers mess stole all the booze got drunk as shit attacked the women beat up two officers it was a very funny and colorful story completely fictional of course and he sent a copy of it to the ap and to upi left a copy on his captains desk then drove like a son of a bitch for the gate
1805376 at fault for bringing them all together and he felt sick 89
1805377 a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the possibilities of the american dream he was a foul caricature of himself a man with no soul no inner convictions with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad he also held him in a strangely high regard
1805378 he didnt belittle us he made us even more of a myth than we were at the time 89
1805379 they just played one of the three songs i know
1805380 but the monster was happy when we made him a maze cause he dont understand intentions he just looks at your face
1805381 i swear by my life and my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine
1805382 if you want to attack a group of people and still be politically correct executives are about your last available target says bond who has read the book twice
1805383 i know from talking to a lot of fortune 500 c e o s that atlas shrugged has had a significant effect on their business decisions even if they dont agree with all of ayn rands ideas
1805384 it offers something other books dont the principles that apply to business and to life in general i would call it complete
1805385 when i die i hope to go to heaven whatever the hell that is and i want to be able to afford the price of admission
1805386 thats what i mean james so i want to be prepared to claim the greatest virtue of them all that i was a man who made money
1805387 perfect capitalism is as attractive and impossible as perfect communism the greedy and lazy will ruin either system for the rest
1805388 until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good you ask for your own destruction when money ceases to become the means by which men deal with one another then men become the tools of other men blood whips and guns or dollars take your choice there is no other
1805389 the heart of the city will beat to the sound of the anvils and grinding stones in the presence of expert french and international expert knife makers
1805390 but my father gave me this when i was 16 this is very traditional in france
1805391 there was no problem when i travelled here from paris
1805392 you are not in france you are in britain now
1805393 as a cub scout in the 1960s i was given a knife by my parents to wear on my belt it was one of the best presents i can remember a bone handle with a long and razor sharp blade housed in a tough leather sheath
1805394 it was certainly dangerous but it was also significant a sign that my mum and dad considered me mature enough to be trusted with such a tool were i to do the same for my son today i would be regarded as irresponsible and he might be regarded as a criminal
1805395 crime has been falling for over 12 years and yet our law makers have passed more than 50 acts of parliament to deal with public concerns that it is getting worse
1805396 some of the legislation has been valuable but there is scant evidence that all the new laws have contributed to making us safer i suspect the constant focus on counteracting the crime menace has helped make us all more fearful
1805397 shall we station a policeman at every kitchen cutlery drawer
1805398 the first thing we need to recognise however difficult it might seem is that panic and fear about young people and knives is far more pervasive and powerful than the risk of knife crime itself
1805399 one thing we should surely have learned by now is that panic and fear can be the most dangerous epidemic of all now that is what i would call a national crisis
1805400 la prima volta che ti ho vista ho subito capito che eri una fan di avril
1805401 guarda quanto toga questa che cha tutti sti cappelli strani
1805402 im the doctor im a time lord im 903 years old and im the man whos going to save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below you got a problem with that
1805403 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1805404 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1805405 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1805406 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1805407 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1805408 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year
1805409 i will purchase a new backpack from wal mart with all her school supplies but nothing else will be new at the beginning of the school year
1805410 we recognized pretty early on the economic environment had taken a bit of a shift
1805411 we looked at what people are experiencing pain at the pump pain when we go to the grocery store
1805412 the good news for boeing is that it is a genuine opportunity
1805413 at this point it is a fair bet that politicians are going to start meddling in the selection process
1805414 normally we prep in april and may and open in june this time the tour begins in august its a nightmare everyone in italy and france is on a beach sunning themselves
1805415 imidacloprid thats gaucho left a small residue in nectar and pollen but there was no evidence of a link with the drop in the bee population
1805416 if we were to follow the teachings of miss carson
1805417 we would return to the dark ages insects vermin and disease would once again inherit the earth
1805418 mans attitude toward nature is today critically important simply because we now have acquired a fateful power to alter and destroy nature but man is part of nature and his war is inevitably a war against himself
1805419 at the sight of this filth and disorder my spirits rose
1805420 the witchs house the woodchoppers hut the gray dwarfs cottage
1805421 one of the wealthiest and most powerful lunatics on earth
1805422 everything i had heard about this man and his country made me want to go there
1805423 an almost robotic obedience decorum rigidity order with no frills a scaling down of space agreed upon courtesies no arm swinging
1805424 the back yards the barns the hovels the side roads and slums the telling facts of village life the misery that airplanes fly over
1805425 adam thought it would be really funny to get paris to respond to the john mccain ad that featured her
1805426 adam contacted paris directly and she agreed to do it he wrote the sketch and she really really loved it
1805427 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1805428 because she decided she just wanted to do it for fun
1805429 via asp how do you copy a remote file to a local folder
1805430 an image right there of the leaning tower of pisa and the washington monument you tell me why those two phallic symbols are placed there
1805431 you remember that alright look at the beginning of that ad again you tell me pow i really wish someone would answer the question run the ad again and take a look at it
1805432 ms wass career as a producer and a television executive coupled with her brilliant storytelling and casting skills are a perfect fit for own and will put us in a position of great strength as we lay the foundation of the channel
1805433 comedy central applauds the new york comedy festival for its ongoing efforts in showcasing and celebrating standup comedy we look forward to providing a national platform for this illustrious event
1805434 one of the beauties of being here in seattle and working at optimedia is to be able to work with one of the top advertisers in the country but do it from what i like to say is a great place to live
1805435 weve had a great relationship with them and really grown the business and grown with them
1805436 weve kind of transcended from being a vendor to a true partnership
1805437 actually helping them innovate on the product development side all the way through to the marketing communications plans that were developing
1805438 working in partnership with mtv last year we actually developed and executive produced a web television show called connected which ran for about nine episodes
1805439 i think it wouldnt have hurt for it to be t mobile presents connected
1805440 at this point mtv is still interested in another round of connected
1805441 we were quite excited when we started seeing signs in stadiums say that barkleys not in their fave fives
1805442 i picked journalism because i needed to be able to satisfy the creative portion of my personality
1805443 and the more i looked at advertising versus some of the other venues it seemed to offer the most opportunity
1805444 my comfort in the quantitative part of the world made media feel like a pretty comfortable place for me to focus on
1805445 that quickly created a desire to be able to get back into a larger agency where i could have the resources that i needed at my fingertips
1805446 i would call myself a mediocre chef with a desire to get better
1805447 i avoid anything thats a casserole and anything that has potato chips on top of it because thats what my mother did when i was growing up
1805448 god bless her but im not going to subject my children to that
1805449 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
1805450 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
1805451 i took an hiv aids test and was found to be positive the doctor gave me a weeks sick leave so i could go for medical attention when i told the managing director about my condition and that i would be on leave for a week he said he wouldnt work with someone who was hiv aids positive
1805452 the persistence of hiv in latent reservoirs presents a major challenge to the ultimate goal of eradicating hiv from the human body
1805453 while researchers strive to answer this and other key scientific questions we cannot afford to squander the prevention and treatment knowledge that already exists today
1805454 ignoring the needs of children affected by hiv and continuing to marginalize groups at greatest risk for infection will only lead to more new infections and fewer people on treatment
1805455 on the back of this application please briefly tell us what this scholarship would mean to you and your future

1805457 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1805458 oh come on you have a house full of gadgets high tech 21 speed bikes easy access to a gigantic mall and 9 kinds of organized sports we didnt have
1805459 when i was a kid there we no virtual 3d playrooms at mcdonalds
1805460 i appreciate the compliment regarding to what i assume are my most recent blog entries as for the prospect of blogspot what is that exactly what i write is mostly written as a throwaway and as such myspace does suffice if anything it exists to fill up the void on the upper right section of my myspace page hah p but blogspot huh perhaps
1805461 the rush hour is in another part of the city peasant and you are far far from it
1805462 you unlock this door with the key of imagination beyond it is another dimension a dimension of sound a dimension of sight a dimension of mind you are moving into a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas youve just crossed over into the twilight zone
1805463 everything is in the opposite direction of what youre used to
1805464 you feel really awkward going the opposite direction that youve trained your body in its a really big difference
1805465 gas is the big deal two stops and well call it a day
1805466 could we as a people have obtained more things for our children and others if we went with the name of tuscarora instead of lumbee
1805467 we have to serve all of the lumbees first before we serve any tuscaroras
1805468 she is terminally ill and was in that shape when she went and applied for assistance
1805469 having between them sold more than 300 million albums it is only to be expected that the first studio collaboration between rock giants queen and revered rock legend paul rodgers in the form of the upcoming album the cosmos rocks is one of this years most eagerly anticipated
1805470 people really truly playing together in the studio you dont get that much these days but you will get it on the new queen and paul rodgers album
1805471 itll be great to see the guys and play and go back down that road again just for one night
1805472 what im doing is protecting the legacy that we have built cementing the rights to the trademark bad company for touring
1805473 i cant really go into that because its kind of in the hands of our lawyers at the moment
1805474 by doing this one night stand with bad company we will be cementing our right to the trademark bad company for touring and anyone who attempts to challenge us and tour misuing our trademark and mislead the fans will be liable to legal action
1805475 i think it should be pure bad company and nothing else
1805476 were gonna dig into the catalog a little bit there are some great songs there id like to revisit like simple man and of course the favorites too
1805477 nothing is effective or bad however my mentation makes it then
1805478 question about a custom search for my site not word search though
1805479 it was two children and one adult the children have their whole lives in front of them the adults life is already half gone
1805480 if anyone causes one of these little ones those who believe in me to stumble it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were drowned in the depths of the sea
1805481 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
1805482 whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me
1805483 you never stand so tall as when you stoop to help a child
1805484 we know ua needs the dorms but my parents were promised theyd have a home for their lives and that promise shouldnt be broken
1805485 we have to have a new and fresh set of conversations about this
1805486 im not putting a dollar amount on it but the boards action is telling our lawyers to go back and get more creative
1805487 theres no question that the university needs on campus housing for students
1805488 but the university has many needs and the question is what form is the housing to take and what are students willing to pay for it
1805489 we are concerned that off campus students are living in a safe and inspected building we are also very concerned that the students behavior is appropriate and that they are being good neighbors
1805490 monmouth university has been very cooperative it gets a little better every year
1805491 it looks like the university will be willing to share some information with us about where students are housed for the purpose of safety
1805492 the university told us they are going to share whatever information they legally can they are going to compare information they have with information we have for the sole reason to make sure students are living in safe and inspected housing
1805493 we meet several times a year to share issues of mutual concern and to hear directly from the community
1805494 we will both look at the addresses that we know students are living at
1805495 students provide the university with their address for emergency purposes
1805496 it is to make sure it is a safe and secure place for the students
1805497 we wanted to essentially enhance police presence in that neighborhood which is an otherwise quiet district in the city
1805498 i think it is a less egregious problem than it was several years ago
1805499 we want to monitor and intervene before it rises to where there is a need for police intervention
1805500 we continue to find space so that students dont have to find housing in a residential community
1805501 we have been at pier village now for three years and i can count on one hand how many times we have had complaints about students there
1805502 if it were a problem for students to live in the fountain gardens or pier village we wouldnt be there today
1805503 i feel good when the apartment complexes call us and are saying that they have an apartment coming and ask if we want it
1805504 we are working to meet the demand for student housing
1805505 you want to be able to provide the opportunity it helps the students it helps the campus and it helps the community
1805506 we continue to find other places for students to live that are appropriate for students to live
1805507 if you look at the numbers there has been a nice and steady decline
1805508 the first couple of weeks of school you may see a spike because there are new people living off campus
1805509 a community norm is different in on campus residential housing and offcampus residential housing
1805510 if a student is involved in an issue of misconduct off campus the police will send a copy of the report to us and i will review it
1805511 we will charge the student under the code of conduct the student will go through the citys court and through the monmouth university court
1805512 just because you do not physically live on campus does not mean you can do whatever you want a students actions affect our reputation
1805513 we tell our students to introduce themselves to their neighbors
1805514 we tell them to help their neighbors to get to know them so that if they are noisy or if it is about trash cans the neighbors will come to them
1805515 we welcome them to the neighborhood and let them know about our zero tolerance policy
1805516 we track the housing through cos we visit every one of those addresses
1805517 first of all more than 80 million people will turn 18 over the next decade
1805518 second more young people are pursing college educations than ever before finally state budget deficits are causing a serious shortfall in university owned housing someone is clearly going to make money from the convergence of trends so why shouldnt it be you
1805519 never forget the discipline required to walk away from a deal thats overpriced and doesnt provide enough cash flow to cover expenses contingency reserves mortgage payments and a reasonable return on the equity investment

1805536 we are considering various strategic options but have reached no final agreement as yet when there is a resolution we will announce it
1805537 one of the things that i always find funny is when people always quote kameo and perfect dark zero as being flops at the launch of the 360

1805699 i am most concerned by the execution of mexican national jos medellin yesterday in texas mr medellin was not informed of his right to consular help at the time of his arrest even though the united states are legally bound to guarantee this right under the 1963 vienna convention on consular relations this is a regrettable attitude by a country which is very vocal about its commitment to the rule of law the judicial authorities also blatantly ignored the order by the international court of justice to stay the execution on the grounds of the violation of the right to consular assistance i wrote to the texas board of pardons and paroles in july asking for a stay of the execution but my appeal has been disregarded in the same way as the calls from the mexican government the un secretary general and several other governments and international organisations the issue at stake is not the guilt of mr medellin he was found guilty of a particularly gruesome crime and he deserved to be punished the problem is the death penalty which is rejected by a great majority of democratic and civilised countries across the world and also the pick and choose attitude of the united states of america and its individual states when it comes to respecting international law the execution of mr medellin was therefore not only a violation of human rights and human dignity but also an act of arrogant defiance which undermines the collective mechanisms for peace and security in the world

1805934 what in the globe practiced does a great credit score run when you mightt even earnings your bills both year develop out of debt number one so start distressing around buying the house or even a just released car etc claiming a high credit score when wasting hundreds of dollars monthly on 21 interest is lunacy inside my opinion

1805965 vacating settlements which were previously approved for these families has rubbed raw the wounds of september 11 it has caused severe upset disappointment and for some anger
1805966 moral reasons of corporate responsibility and a desire that u s taxpayers not be required to pay for my familys loss
1805967 my attorneys fee were agreed at 25 percent were earned at 25 percent and i request that your honor please pay these attorneys fees at 25 percent of my recovery
1805968 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1805969 we learned a great deal about what happened on september 11th but compensation does not heal our wounds
1805970 the wounds of 9 11 will not easily be assuaged
1805971 but neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards
1805972 the nice thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every cell type in the body the difficult thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every type of cell in the body
1805973 and so when you push them to specialize they tend to make different cell types were trying to control that process and identify the genes that get the cells down a pathway and then hold them at the start
1805974 our goal is to recreate what happens in the embryo but in the dish
1805975 and so for us this is truly a step forward in understanding what genes can control cell fate and use them to make clinically relevant tissue
1805976 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1805977 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1805992 my initial reaction to this proposal is huh theres no question that this country has not been investing enough in either rebuilding and modernizing existing infrastructure or adding much needed new capacity but is a new federal entity of this sort a sensible response

1806019 iran has also tested high altitude explosions of the shihab 3 a test mode consistent with emp attack and described the tests as successful iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1806020 while the commission does not know the intention of iran in conducting these activities we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots
1806021 the government is well within its rights to tell the public we believe you dont need to worry about any such future attacks but it doesnt seem right to leak all this stuff about a dead guy

1806038 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1806039 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1806040 they may not have hit a home run but at least they hit a triple
1806041 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges

1806057 youre always going to be worried that in that first meeting theyre going to be like ok its kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey on a desert island hunting for pirate treasure but its not going to go that way my expectation at this time from everything that ive heard is that it will very much honor the dramatic and thematic elements of the game they certainly understand the material and are able to provide a stamp of their own
1806058 i think theyre a little generous with their time its hard just in the fact its a movie you have to walk that line between the fact that its a property you love and honoring that property and realizing its a game weve sat down a couple of times and had conversations and weve talked with john whos working on stuff
1806059 weve also executed a search warrant on their house and have recovered a large amount of property i wouldnt say its everything there is quite a bit missing but its a lot
1806060 adam thought it would be really funny to get paris to respond to the john mccain ad that featured her

1806064 i just dont think its necessary in a parliamentary context to use that word completely without warning i think it came as a surprise and a shock
1806065 the house finds it justifiably offensive and i just ask the house to consider how offensive it is when its addressed by a work and income case officer to someone who is at their mercy at a very difficult situation in their life and is addressed in that way
1806066 management there want to give them prisoners all the rights in the world its a maximum security jail housing the worst of the worst in the country and inmates shouldnt be out all day we shouldnt have four wings of prisoners out thats 46 maximum security prisoners and four staff to look after them
1806067 i think the issue really is is why the national party says one thing to the voters in public and another behind closed doors
1806068 they wont announce it until its done ms bellini said

1806786 infelizmente n o consegui fazer o que queria e o cara jogou bastante s lido errou muito pouco fez muito winners
1806787 o terceiro set foi no detalhe tive break point para quebrar mas ele sacou bem e aproveitou melhor as chances
1806788 a quadra aqui est bem mais lenta do que em ribeir o preto na semana passada e assim o ponto fica bem mais jogado

1806797 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
1806798 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another
1806799 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved

1806804 have agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
1806805 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran and its failure to meet the deadline set by the unscr 1803 the p5 1 are discussing the next steps in the unsc and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanction resolution
1806806 have agreed that while informal contacts between mr solana and mr iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further
1806807 our objective is not sanctions for the sake of sanctions
1806808 but we are getting closer to the point where we will make that determination
1806809 we would have preferred a clear yes but it is more complicated than that
1806810 we certainly do not believe that it is a foregone conclusion that it the dialogue is not going to be successful
1806811 the state of online video going beyond the pre roll

1806829 separarlo del plantel me dio tristeza y dolor peor desde el lugar que me toca lo hice para ayudarlo
1806830 separarlo del plantel me dio tristeza y dolor peor desde el lugar que me toca lo hice para ayudarlo a entender que tiene que tratarse s todo lo que significa ariel para river pero quiero que primero debe recuperarse como persona
1806831 no fueron horas simples para m fue la decisi n que m s me cost y ojala se pueda recuperar porque ortega es un buen chico y yo lo conozco m s que ustedes los periodistas porque compart muchas cosas con l cosas buenas y malas es un chico con buenos sentimientos y espero que alg n d a lo pueda valorar

1806835 seguramente en principio saldremos a la cancha con el 3 4 3 aunque el camino es largo el f tbol es muy din mico y seguiremos buscando variantes
1806836 conozco al chaco torres y me parece un gran jugador pero lo escuch por ustedes los periodistas no se nada el arquero que buscamos no es peratta podr a ser albil

1806849 we were looking 10 years ago right when rdf was starting to come out at how we could solve these general problems and came up with our own semantic data model
1806850 my background is in epistemology and ontology university of chicago which are core underpinnings of semantics we were thrilled when sir tim berners lee and the rest of the w3c world wide web consortium gang started pushing this semantic data model because we knew we were right on target with our ideas
1806851 i had put together a business plan and was looking for some business help interviewing potential ceos one said id consider coming and working with you but youve got let me bring erich
1806852 these basic features turn data from any source into web accessible searchable annotatable hipaa compliant items and allow end users to pick data subsets and identify data networks from them
1806853 the web query and knowledge explorer then make this data easily and usefully available in various formats to a broad set of users
1806854 virtually any researcher or manager derives both knowledge and efficiency benefits by using the web query to search and browse data and dashboards derived from federated data and to export results to their own applications such as partek or spotfire in ad hoc or automated workflows informaticians and other end users apply the knowledge explorer to visualize integrated networks and run semantic queries these queries are capable of characterizing a potential drugs activities stratifying tumor types based on multidimensional biomarker activity etc using sparql and more advanced semantic query languages
1806855 think of it as creating targeted knowledgebases that can be broad or narrow depending on the question being asked
1806856 single marker based research is running into a lot of challenges now there are also challenges with multi marker research but io informatics makes it very easy to bring in all of the values from different data sources and networks and really see how theyre functionally connected
1806857 in other words how the proteins the genes the metabolites etc fit together to create a profile that describes the behavior of a molecule or the progression of a disease you also can track data across time sentient makes it very efficient for researchers to create a signature that really tells the difference between a successful compound or a failing compound or a tumor type
1806858 mark wilkinson has done a lot of work with semantic software from icapture jonas almeida is one of the world leaders in applying semantic technology they were giving us feedback on the nuts and bolts
1806859 you really want to have a thesaurus not only for classes and terms but also for ontologies and relationships so this was an area where we went ahead and applied that we put in a thesaurus that supports merging ontologies and mapping different relationships across ontologies thats a nice example
1806860 its also really nice for us to hear what people can say appropriately about competitive analysis i mean these guys are really looking at what else is out there and within their rights theyll tell us what they know about other software thats useful for us and has also been very encouraging people think they can do great competitive analysis but its hard to do you really need to have people using the software the competing software
1806861 i think we can go into healthcare with healthcare data management particularly were going to have great strengths for decision support of diagnostics and biomarkers were going to be creating knowledgebases with signatures that are going to be useful for physicians and doctors
1806862 ontologies actually describe how you think something works so youre really talking about how you think things fit together in the real world whereas a schema organizes data for applications
1806863 we greatly appreciate and effectively use all of the great work that a lot of smart people have been putting into defining ontologies
1806864 theres a big argument about whether you have to have a perfect ontology or can or should you do things with smaller sub ontologies or folk ontologies weve learned through our experience that we can do useful things with both with formal ontologies or with targeted sub ontologies our customers are welcome to share these with their partners or with formal standards bodies this is how learning happens the more people who work on and with ontologies the better were helping pharma companies solve problems were glad that there are people out there doing work on ontologies and were taking advantage of that for customers

1806877 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1806878 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step

1806880 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1806881 two dimensional databases such as the planned telecommunications database of the numbers people call from their landlines and mobile phones are much more worrying
1806882 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1806883 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

1806889 when the information falls within the law enforcement counterterrorism or national security responsibility of the receiving agency or may assist in preventing crime or the use of violence or any conduct dangerous to human life or property
1806890 a government official or any other individual when necessary to avoid imminent danger to life or liberty
1806891 the intent of the propose revisions to part 23 is to not create unreasonable impediments to information sharing
1806892 another incremental shift away from law enforcement acting within the law
1806893 we should have that debate in public rather than make the change in incremental adjustments to the law
1806894 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media a wide array of threats and risks

1806918 these payments mean a historical recognition of the horrible fate of budapest jewry during the nazi persecution

1806968 ive been meaning to post about a dvd a reader sent to daphne knowing how much she likes princesses and princesses its called prima princessa presents swan lake and is a hip fun forty minute show for kids cool new twist on learning ballet featuring the paris opera ballet and students from the american school of ballet you know how educational artsy videos usually fall into one of three categories too silly and not engaging enough to hold attention for the amount of time you need to shower or make dinner too advanced for them to grasp the fun and purpose and just right but so short you have to spend all your time rewinding or skipping the self promotion that seems to take up half the tape prima princessa cleverly navigates each of these issues and offers short bursts of actual ballet lessons scenes from the paris operas performance of swan lake and adorable clips of little girls running around in tutus imitating the dancers very very cute heres the interesting part i thought daphne would be all over the little girls and not as much into the professional performance boy was i wrong well i was right about one thing she had to run for her ballet outfit so she could be properly attired while watching for starters she would not sit down to watch it she stood in the middle of the living room floor right in front of the tv and studied that video to get all the moves down she liked the little girls enjoyed the classes but was absolutely riveted by the ballet performance several times in a row which was a score for me because that meant 120 minutes of rapt enjoyment of educational entertainment while i scraped lord knows what off the kitchen floors actually thats not true i dont scrape the floors because i know exactly whats on them so ive got to agree with prima princessa is swan lake on a budget daphne has never expressed such interest in ballet before and is now dying to go see a real performance this is the ticket to getting your little ones to look forward to and sit still during the nutcracker or maybe even expanding their tastes so you can go to the ballet outside of the christmas season one more thing to put on the list for things to do with redeeming social value that are actually fun

1807105 employment in the information industry declined by 13 000 in july and by 44 000 over the past 12 months telecommunications lost 5 000 jobs in july
1807106 there was a slight increase in demand for web 2 0 technology six to eight months ago but that atrophied as the economy slowed down
1807107 india with its huge middle class population of over 250 million is like an untapped gold mine
1807108 with its present international travel market not even covering 2 of the population the country offers large opportunities for airlines india is an important geographic area in all our future network plans
1807109 so when a rebound happens there in global markets these carriers will have an advantage as they would have already built capacities in india
1807110 other reasons include a nearly liberalized bilateral government policy with other countries and sustained economic growth amidst recession
1807111 we will be adding two more flights in bangalore as india is our key market
1807112 india today is by far the largest single market for qatar airways with a network of nine cities which represents more than 10 of our global network of 83 international routes
1807113 for example we have registered a load factor of 86 during the first half of this year in the india sharjah sector
1807114 the overall number of indian arrivals to malaysia from january to may 2008 is 234 245 a growth of 32 5 from last year similarly singapore has also witnessed above average growth
1807115 however international carriers will have to be a bit cautious in increasing their capacities considering the current downturn
1807116 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1807117 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1807118 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say thatwe screwed up
1807119 in their post event examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1807120 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1807121 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in thecloud like mobileme
1807122 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1807123 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch
1807124 people say this is even better than all the rumors
1807125 they wont do this on hardware or the os but maybe on these internet related services they will
1807126 i give it less than a 50 50 chance of happening
1807127 sometimes your it is organized around efficiency and your business is organized more around responsiveness
1807128 an us versus them culture where it hunkers down behind the technologies they manage problems they solve and metrics like help desk tickets served system capacity uptime and volumes
1807129 at a minimum the cultures shouldnt be in conflict with each other
1807130 its more than just communicate communicate communicate which you hear all the time its actually being very disciplined and very organized about it
1807131 really low prices and they should be of very good quality thats the only thing we look at we would never look at anything else we would discard anything else that doesnt fall into those boundaries
1807132 we will be very active on the boards of these companies
1807133 i think we can contribute somewhat in terms of commercializing the product they are developing and then obviously distributing the product as well
1807134 within one or two years i think well be between eight and 10
1807135 our first focus is what we sell in the stores and what our customers need
1807136 its quite natural that for instance solar panels are more interesting to spaniards and californians and so forth than they would be to swedes
1807137 initially we will be looking more in europe than anywhere else but we do not have any geographical restrictions for our investments
1807138 once a company is up and running in five or seven years or something like that and if we exit from that company the money that weve earned in that investment will stay within the ikea greentech fund
1807139 i have to thank you for your web site its an amazing resource

1807190 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1807191 i was attracted to the academic resource center project because it visibly demonstrates the continuing commitment of the athletics department to helping student athletes succeed in their academic pursuits and earn their degrees
1807192 the student part of the kent state university student athlete is taken seriously and supported strongly and it is my desire to remain affiliated with that effort
1807193 by combining support of the academic resource center with an endowment for the athletic academic honors dinner it is my hope that my contribution will impact student athletes all along the continuum of academic endeavor from those individuals who need academic support to those who excel in the classroom it is a privilege to continue to be affiliated in a meaningful way with an outstanding athletics program
1807194 judys gift further reiterates her lasting commitment to a strong educational model which will support student athletes for the long term
1807195 this commitment speaks volumes of judys compassionate nature and benevolence for higher education
1807196 i am so privileged to have had the extreme good fortune to come under the sphere of influence of judy devine
1807197 everybody is strapped financially and with the increasing cost of medicine healthcare and gas it impacts us all
1807198 its impossible to deploy them in the form of a rope
1807199 let us instill fear in all those whom would dare try to take our liberty away from us again let us begin with the french may they tremble when they approach our coasts if not by the memory of the cruelty that they have inflicted at least by the terrible resolution that we are about to take to devote to death anyone born french who would dirty of his sacrilegious foot the territory of liberty
1807200 let us instill fear in all those whom would dare try to take our liberty away from us again words of jean jacques dessalines
1807201 these lands are not in use one of the factors that have caused the worlds food problems consists of producing ethanol on agricultural land so as a socially responsible company we will not produce biofuels at the cost of this difficulty

1807206 a lot of the srishti design students who saw me playing with this used to have one themselves several years ago back then this cost nearly 75
1807207 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach

1807209 is an attempt to create a home for community driven specifications following the open source model similar to the apache software foundation the foundation is aimed at building a lightweight framework to help communities deal with the legal requirements necessary to create successful and widely adopted specification
1807210 we are very concerned about the manner in which costs have jumped for these works we understand that several cost components which would cost x in other countries have been indicated as 3x by sail
1807211 it is a sellers market and they these companies dictate the terms
1807212 we are in total panic and it is as if we have these suppliers pointing a gun to our foreheads
1807213 the suppliers quote high and simply refuse to re negotiate
1807214 we are not in a position to comment on this issue
1807215 we are trying to take steps to lessen the damage but cant discuss those measures with you
1807216 what is it that we could have done to avoid such as crisis
1807217 it takes a lot of time and energy to build an enterprise and the mistakes are not always very grave at the end of the day everyone wants to close issues with the regulator and go ahead with their business
1807218 it saves the time efforts and money of the regulator as well as the violators of rules as they dont have to go through a gamut of legal proceedings
1807219 in extremely grey offences the regulator should think twice before agreeing to a consent order
1807220 neutrino physics is internationally one of the hottest areas of research and a dedicated observatory and lab in india is an absolute must
1807221 simply pass through anything into the ground and that is why we need an underground observatory to detect their presence
1807222 this is a basic science project because of which its only the initial few years that are going to see construction moreover the observatory will be underground and so no forest land needs to be cleared and post construction the number of vehicles there is going to be highly regulated
1807223 we still await cabinet approval after all clearances come through and so i expect construction to start by the year end
1807224 the initial agreement didnt specify how much land they needed for the campus we were subsequently told that the project would require nearly eight acres we cant spare more than three acres

1807227 when i asked brett if he would serve as my chief of staff last fall i was aware that he might not be able to remain in that position until the end of my tenure
1807228 i am very grateful for bretts exemplary service to the department and to the nation and for his wise counsel during his time as my chief of staff he is an outstanding lawyer and a fine manager and i wish him and his family the best as he starts this new chapter in his career
1807229 i am happy that brian benczkowski has agreed to serve as my chief of staff
1807230 brian has been one of my closest advisers in the department since my confirmation process and his exceptional judgment and extensive experience in the department will be of great value to me and to the department in the upcoming months
1807231 its a job that takes a significant amount of time skadden understands that and helps make time available so i can do this so theres a real commitment by the firm also

1807244 but dont get too close the magic is so powerful it makes you feel queasy
1807245 its hard to dig now but i manage to do it i imagine the magic would be stronger if the item sensed two people close to it
1807246 the magic must be a way of protecting the item
1807247 well i had thought about that before i think the spectacles allow you to see hidden worlds or maybe transport you somewhere if they do the magic will be stronger
1807248 the sites are designed to trick people into taking on overpriced useless credit monitoring and they do so by attempting to make it appear as if youre going to get something for free

1807259 do not endorse the new primary ozone standard as being sufficiently protective of the public health
1807260 fail ed to satisfy the explicit stipulations of the clean air act that you ensure an adequate margin of safety for all individuals including sensitive populations
1807261 we dont believe there are any good arguments against granting the waiver
1807262 extreme friction within the agency and institutional damage demoralizing the legal staff and further separating staff from the political leadership at the agency
1807263 inconsistent with the principle of sound science that relies on among other things transparency
1807264 the omb and the white house set the standard even though theoretically it was set by the epa administrator

1807282 this television distribution agreement is a major leap forward for independent american horror creators allowing them to find a vast untapped audience for their work im looking forward to bringing quality horror product to european audiences and im proud to begin that with the bunker
1807283 having written the screenplay for the first flowers on the razorwire episode i was very familiar with the way hart envisioned a full on tv series
1807284 so when i wrote the bunker i saw it taking the series to its natural next plateau which was a feature like the tales from the crypt demon night film it made all the sense in the world helming it myself might not have but directing it was a challenge too good to pass up
1807285 the curiosity angle is nice but now that the film is making the rounds as we look for a distribution deal and the reception its gotten has been so positive this opportunity to showcase it to such a large audience is more than i could have hoped for im excited about working with hart on other episodes for the series weve been in the indie trenches together a long time so what better way to make a splash than on indiepix
1807286 as we build and brand our thematic channels we are very careful about the companies we allow to program content hart d fisher presents very unique products that are naturals for compelling content
1807287 prepared to vote is a program designed to raise every voters awareness of the many obstacles in the electoral process that could affect their right to vote in the 2008 election through prepared to vote we hope to ensure that every eligible voter cases a vote that counts
1807288 i think that you should start sleeping in your own bed and if you get scared in the middle of the night then you can come into moms bed or when you wake up in the morning how does that sound
1807289 well you dont want to grow up and tell your friends that you slept with your mother until you were nine do you
1807290 well jack you have a big brother that makes your life difficult at tmes and he would love to tell your friends this and to be honest with you you are too old to be sleeping in my bed
1807291 just one more night then i will never sleep with you ever again
1807292 lets go upstairs right now and find something to watch and then straight to sleep
1807293 we made progress in the quarter but we are far from satisfied
1807294 weve not turned the corner yet and ive been clear that this will take some time
1807295 collectively these actions will reduce our gross add production of customers but should improve our profitability over time
1807296 there are clear signs of improvement at sprint yet there remains no clear answer on how the company can ever return to growth or reasonable profit margins
1807297 my virginity was restored in a delicate operation just last week and i honestly view it as life saving surgery
1807298 if my husband cannot prove to his family that i am a virgin i would be hounded ostracised and sent home in disgrace my father who is a devout muslim would regard it as the ultimate shame
1807299 the entire family could be cast out from the friends and society they hold dear and i honestly believe that one of my fanatically religious cousins or uncles might kill me in revenge to purge them of my sins incredible as it may seem
1807300 ever since my family arranged this marriage for me ive been terrified that on my wedding night my secret would come out it has only been since my surgery last week that ive actually been able to sleep properly now i can look forward to my marriage
1807301 women who do not respect the hijab and their husbands deserve to die
1807302 i do not understand how these women who do not respect the hijab 28 years after the birth of the islamic republic are still alive
1807303 these women and their husbands and their fathers must die
1807304 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come
1807305 his image of himself was always the handsome celebrity flyboy now somebody else is the celebrity
1807306 name one piece of energy legislation hes worked on in 30 years
1807307 she said that in her experience the tension more often exists the other way around when girls who want to wear the hijab are discouraged by their families because they fear it will make them the targets of racism
1807308 the wearing of any religious symbol should be forbidden in the workplace of the civil service in order to ensure the secular character of the state
1807309 what that would do is close the door to muslim women who want to teach
1807310 it goes against religious freedoms that are guaranteed in the quebec charter of rights
1807311 when im president of the united states im not going to let them congress go on vacation
1807312 not nasty should have been strangled at birth twatholes like you

1807325 not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it
1807326 the commission has concluded that the present transaction would not raise competition concerns
1807327 at a time when oil companies are raking in record profits the stubbornness of those who stood in the way of helping people in desperate need is incomprehensible to me it is an outrage the american people do not want to see the most vulnerable among us held hostage by the senate republican leaders
1807328 lawmakers on notice with ballot plan rmgn proposal plays off anger at state government

1807333 we think if the public had been told the truth about how much permanent damage there will be to the dunes trees plants and animals the outrage would have killed this idea why else did harbor shores hide this from us
1807334 extensive excavation and stabilization of the dunes would be necessary to plant golf course features
1807335 in a plan which describes wetland fill to the last cubic yard there is no dissection whatsoever of the impacts to the dunes the signature landscape of lake michigans eastern shore once theyre gone theyre gone forever
1807336 rarely has the land and water conservation fund act been so violated
1807337 the law is very clear this lawsuit has national implications for places everywhere that matter like jean klock park
1807338 this park was left to all of us and our children and their children forever
1807339 no one living today will be alive when this lease runs out in 105 years
1807340 we have a better idea build harbor shores golf course outside the park and follow our lead to restore jean klock park to the grandeur envisioned in the 1920s by the foremost prairie school landscape architect jens jensen that way well have something special for everyone

1807347 firmar por un club como el h rcules es una gran responsabilidad he venido a dejar lo mejor de m para la alegr a de la gente y para que el equipo pueda conseguir objetivos importantes

1807354 we chose rsuite cms because we had a very tight timeframe to convert our data feed architecture over to xml
1807355 automated processes that consume transform and distribute xml have allowed us to reduce staff over the last year while producing nearly the same amount of print products and many news online products and new features for our web site
1807356 the ability of the business to rapidly repurpose content into new products for industry events and trends has given us additional revenue streams
1807357 it resources have been able to devote their time to developing new products and features instead of having to support systems that have been automated

1807472 many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted
1807473 raped beaten and burned just because i had nowhere to go and wouldnt do what someone wanted me to homeless women are especially bullied
1807474 for the first couple of days everyone is so nice to you the next thing you know someones stolen your stuff you might get kicked to death at night sleeping rough but in a hostel you can get any number of diseases with all the germs theyre very unhygienic
1807475 women are still much more of a sexual object on the streets than men sure there are young boys begging and prostituting themselves they go into the public toilets and its never ever talked about but sadly its all about drugs the whole issue around everything on the streets today is about drugs
1807476 but she doesnt have the experience to get around it she begs then hands the money over to him and theyre off to score if she doesnt get off the gear theres no way shell escape him you see a lot of this kind of thing
1807477 they stored my possessions and offered me a place to shower most days
1807478 if you are a woman one of the worst experiences of being homeless is when your period comes the lack of hygiene and the humiliation is hard to describe simple things are suddenly so complicated you have to go and find some place to clean up and its not always easy a man does not have these problems

1807481 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1807482 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1807483 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip

1807527 continued subscriber losses and investments in customer service improvements are taking a toll on both top line and bottom line growth
1807528 sprint nextel currently expects to report higher post paid subscriber losses in the third quarter due to a seasonal uptick in churn when compared with second quarter 2008 results
1807529 we expect sequential declines in post paid gross adds to moderate and we expect modest pressure on post paid average revenue per user for the balance of 2008 this combination of factors is expected to result in a sequential reduction in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter capital spending for the wireless and wireline segments is expected to be comparable to first half levels of 1 3 billion and 261 million respectively also expects free cash flow to improve substantially in the second half of 2008 furthermore the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future and expects to reduce gross debt by at least 1 billion by the end of the third quarter
1807530 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
1807531 our company wide retention efforts which include simply everything plans our now network campaign and the launch of the instinct handset are proving to be effective retention tools particularly for high value customers and this is beginning to have positive impacts on churn and arpu

1807533 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
1807534 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
1807535 but for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it
1807536 the balls not in anybody at rares court really its squarely in the license holders courts its a shame its kind of locked in this no mans land theres nothing on live arcade theres nothing on wii
1807537 its just what happens legally sometimes not necessarily with games but you see it with music and films things get locked in this legal limbo even most of the parties involved probably all the parties involved want to solve it its such a complex issue
1807538 its probably going to go down in the annuls of gaming history as one of the big mysteries
1807539 i just watch the oil usage data domestic and international and thats demand data not talk of demand data theres a difference this oil market and the rise up to 147 has been driven by oil demand increases right now we have real demand declines in the u s and slowing demand growth consumption in asia so that means were headed lower

1807541 washington barack obama may be the fresh face in this years presidential election but nearly half say theyre already tired of hearing about him a poll says with election day still three months away 48 percent said theyre hearing too much about the democratic candidate according to a poll released wednesday by the nonpartisan pew research center 26 percent said the same about his republican rival john mccain
1807542 international food demand has improved food profit margins to the point where farming can compete for capital with other up and coming sectors
1807543 theres always a risk that food demand could pull back slightly on a global economic slowdown but the long term factors are and will remain bullish
1807544 those two factors combined with the preference by growers to lower transportation costs by having more food distributed to closer markets where possible mean well continue to see an increase in farms and growing areas its not a cyclical thing its a structural change
1807545 so that new farm you pass in the countryside may in fact be owned and operated by an ex investment banker or deal maker
1807546 the aim is to stop off at crafters and makers along the way and take photos of the work we see and put it onto the travel diary on our web site and blog as we go along
1807547 we will gladly drop by where we are invited by crafters if someone wants to show us their work then we will certainly consider stopping off we will come round take some pictures have a chat about their work and add it to our web site
1807548 an internet service fee would amount to a sizable amount of cash for airlines at 10 a passenger with say 100 of 180 or 190 passengers accessing the service thats an extra 1000 per flight which is significant
1807549 and this is one fee that the public will not react negatively to in my view
1807550 the public will use and really like in flight internet service weve become very used to being connected with the ability to communicate as well used to taking advantage of flying time for business tasks
1807551 it also represents another option besides reading or watching a movie during flights for a person like me it will be e mail city a big help

1807570 the oklahoma education associations proposed constitutional amendment would require major reductions in crucial needs such as roads public safety and health care programs increased taxes or both its completely unnecessary the legislature has provided record setting appropriations for schools for several years in a row including significant teacher pay increases and our commitment to education remains strong
1807571 aside from potential cuts any tax increases indirectly required by the oea initiative would be devastating to working families already struggling to get by oklahomans cant afford higher taxes we recently lowered income taxes and raised the standard deduction for working families and retirees to reverse course at a time when oklahomans are facing 4 gas would create a real hardship for many
1807572 oklahoma roads are in desperate need of repair and the eight year plan approved this year will be imperiled if the oeas constitutional amendment is adopted how will it help our economy to put more money into schools if our roads look like a minefield and our bridges are on the verge of collapse

1807653 we are delighted that the written declaration has been officially adopted by the european parliament to ban harp and hooded seals the eu commission is now charged with drafting legislation that implements the ban so although it is not possible to amend the text of the written declaration now that it has been adopted we can press the european commission to review the scope of the ban and include cape fur seals and all species of seals around the world hunted we are horrified that the namibian authorities are culling 85 000 seal pups this year an act of unjustified cruelty the culls in canada and russia have been much publicised but until this week we were unaware of the plight of the cape fur seals we agree any european ban must include all seal products and will do all that we can to help bring an end to the unnecessary and inhumane slaughter of seal pups in namibia

1807657 no person pursue or shoot at or wilfully disturb kill or capture a seal
1807658 sealers must herd together and then club a seal pup of less than 1 year old on the head until dead
1807659 the implementation of cites needs the support and co operation of the public the convention is not designed to ban all international trade in wildlife products but to ensure that trade does not contribute to possible extinction of animals
1807660 when the current concessionaires became involved in sealing in 1990 the industry was non existent no markets existed for any of the raw seal pup skin products other than the male genitals
1807661 the secretariat has reviewed information supplied by namibia and is satisfied with its implementation
1807662 donkeys have traditionally been thought of as stoic animals that do not display signs of stress or disease
1807663 however during routine necropsy examination of donkeys at our devon sanctuary it became apparent that gastric ulcers were common and that ulceration was in some cases extensive
1807664 the results of this study show that donkeys can be maintained on a fibre concentrate diet with no increased risk of ulceration when compared to those receiving ad lib forage
1807665 this is particularly encouraging because products such as spillers high fibre cubes which can be soaked to form a mash allow the management of ill or elderly animals requiring supplementary or specialist feeding
1807666 the blue cross welfare award rewards people who go the extra mile to care for horses unlike other awards that look for academic or equestrian achievements

1807707 in sierra leone one in four children dies before reaching their fifth birthday its shocking and tragic especially when the solutions are simple things like vaccinations against measles or using a mosquito net to reduce the chance of getting malaria
1807708 saving these childrens lives is a top priority for unicef and as an ambassador i hope i can help to draw attention to this issue across the world
1807709 we are grateful to david beckham for shining the spotlight on the unacceptable number of young children who are dying often needlessly in sierra leone and other developing countries

1807720 jamie lynn went through a time of partying and casey was just a part of that
1807721 casey is a serial cheater who has lied to jamie lynn time and time again this past spring he was forced to tell jamie lynn that hed cheated on her and gotten that girl pregnant

1807770 when you dominate search in such a way then you need to go the extra mile to assure the public
1807771 at the end of the day googles job is to serve the advertisers with the largest budgets
1807772 if someone in google said link to knol first wed hear about it because it would really cut against the ideology of everyone who works at google
1807773 oh i spent 39 on fast food when i only budgeted 25
1807774 scene thats sure to capture the um affections of all you male fans
1807775 that said did i mention kristin is gorgeous and theres one very steamy night club scene where she does awesome things to get the information she needs
1807776 there are just way too many characters in the street fighter universe to cram them all into one film
1807777 we want to do each one the justice he she deserves
1807778 the ability to write clearly is crucial to getting your message across no matter what youre writing whether its an email a blog post a magazine article or a letter to a friend clear and concise writing is vital to having your words read and understood
1807779 congratulations on briefly outlining the fundamental elements of successful writing
1807780 have you ever read an email from someone that was too wordy lacked focus and left you confused
1807781 have you ever read an email that was too wordy lacked focus and left you confused
1807782 verbosity redundancy poor grammar and bad punctuation in virtually every paragraph
1807783 have you ever read an email from someone that was too wordy lacked focus and left you confused
1807784 if i had that life i would never act like that
1807785 thats 5 i can use to pay off my debts
1807786 the first quarter marked a very good start to 2008
1807787 demonstrate a strengthening core business and a solid global market environment
1807788 investors are likely to be encouraged by intels execution their new products and their gross margin expectation
1807789 in a time of uncertainty at least theyre delivering on what they can control
1807790 with intel and amd both pre announcing this quarter even for different reasons there was a concern about a problem in the pc market
1807791 it looks like intel put that to rest it doesnt look like were seeing any deterioration in pc fundamentals
1807792 our strengthening core business offset weakness in our nand business
1807793 for an organization that has not eased the suffering of a single individual on the ground in darfur to criticize those who are helping thousands every day is more than ironic
1807794 this is not a report card on sponsors good works this is simply a report card judging companies solely on the basis of the dream for darfur yardstick a companys willingness to publicly pressure a sovereign nation to intervene in the activities of another country
1807795 at johnson amp johnson weve worked hard for years to help the people of darfur which is consistent with the commitment of johnson amp johnson to contribute to better health around the world given the complexities of the tragedy in darfur we are disappointed that dream for darfur has used such a narrow context by which to evaluate the companys response
1807796 we commend dream for darfur for raising awareness of this tragic situation however we strongly disagree with the organizations approach as well as the use of the olympic games as a political platform and the assertions made in the report card
1807797 while we appreciate dream for darfurs efforts to bring attention to the situation visa believes a lasting resolution to the crisis can only be achieved through governmental and diplomatic channels and not by olympic games sponsors
1807798 although listed in apples last developer leopard seed note as an issue the recommendation to use apples software update process to install the hp driver set for the leopard developer seed is actually a test scenario not a driver problem or bug issue
1807799 kampground and again the next night in meyers flat from then on we rode together

1807805 not the best of days that their first reaction when being charged by a rhino is to shoot in front of the animal to try and scare it off
1807806 its time to buy america as the rest of the world implodes
1807807 there has been no news or developments that we are aware of to cause the run up in the shares
1807808 theyre one of the best operators out there they managed their inventories very very leanly so they didnt have to be as promotional as they thought they would business held up better than they expected
1807809 while our new fiscal year is off to a good start we continue to have a conservative view of the domestic retail environment
1807810 congress not the court is the branch in the better position to undertake the sensitive task
1807811 w e might assume that congress representing the united states sovereign lawmaking body within the international system has at least some leeway to aid in the development of the category of international offenses
1807812 not so fast abanes did ken silva really break federal law
1807813 those who need to know exactly what i found to be problematic in silvas article already know the specifics i am not bound by anything anyone to do anything more than what i have already done
1807814 hanna should be an impact player right away in our league
1807815 she can spot up and shoot but her strength is really her explosiveness and a superior court awareness that allows her to attack the basket her coaches in sweden rave about her intensity and leadership abilities so obviously were always glad to add someone with those attributes we couldnt be more excited to have hanna become a seawolf
1807816 you care too much to help we call that fail

1807820 while you are quite welcome to choose not to hear others ideas and quite welcome to contribute your own ideas its about time you stopped calling for censorship of the ideas you dont agree with
1807821 censorship of any kind is a very slippery slope and it takes us all saying
1807822 im used to this sort of thing all the time mention jesus around people who dont know him and the world implodes around you i love america this land of free speech and all the people who wish to censor it
1807823 when i was an atheist i didnt go around shoving religious people around i simply didnt care what they had to say its such a backwards world after all i dont get offended when people talk about the easter bunny im simply content to sit back and know he doesnt exist
1807824 should posts like this receive this type of attention no
1807825 im simply content to sit back and know he doesnt exist why should atheism be any different
1807826 maces and swords colorful helmets and shields i see rip and break when the army enters and many vassals i see wound each other where the horses of the dead and the injured look for a shelter in the forest
1807827 good night im looking for mr hirogawa hasnt he arrived yet
1807828 do brag sir oliver says roland the courteous sure says the count as long as charles permits shall the king take her daughter whose hair is so blond and put us in her chamber in a discreet bed and ill have her one hundred times that very night otherwise shall i lose my head that is my pledge
1807829 im saying you know who but cant say who and cant say you know either
1807830 this isnt technical research pulled together by ed stetzer and the people at lifeway these are conclusions i have come to after living in this community for 31 years sharing the gospel here for 14 years and serving as pastor here for seven years
1807831 when youre suppressing communication and feelings during conflict with your husband its doing something very negative to your physiology and in the long term it will affect your health
1807832 this doesnt mean women should start throwing plates at their husbands but there needs to be a safe environment where both spouses can equally communicate
1807833 but we worry about the people who do it in a more extreme fashion
1807834 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
1807835 i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
1807836 he has the potential to be an all american and a fine player for our program
1807837 she has a competitiveness that will prove vital to the success of our program
1807838 i look forward to having them as part of our team as we work to reach individual and team goals that will reflect strongly on our university
1807839 we have been talking to rhys yes but as yet nothing is finalised
1807840 i have heard rumours he has decided to leave but i havent heard anything for certain
1807841 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1807842 i just laughed i said seriously you are joking and then he has a go at anthony youre kidding yourself if you take advice off him
1807843 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1807844 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1807845 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1807846 i havent been happy at the bulldogs for a while
1807847 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1807848 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us for five years
1807849 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1807850 we fully intend to move forward with additional prosecutions on the 20 other cases that are currently in the military commission system
1807851 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1807852 is material support a war crime the defence believes it is not
1807853 a good outcome for the government in arguing that this was a fair trial
1807854 the fourth factor the ability of the defence to mount a full defence is where the criticism of the process likely will be levied
1807855 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1807856 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1807857 the airport is closed i think it will stay that way for a while until the new authorities get organised

1807860 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order
1807861 it was a tough one but we did the job
1807862 right from the kick off they pressured us and made sure we couldnt get our passing game going
1807863 when your goalkeeper is one of your best players and your other two are probably defenders michael thwaite and roddy vargas you know that you havent played your best football
1807864 but sometimes you play a game like that when youre not at your best and you come away with a win and you think not a bad team to get that sort of result with not the best performance
1807865 it has been the perfect preparation for the a league season and to get to the final which the boys set themselves the challenge of winning it sets us up really well for the a league season
1807866 maar ja ze stonden in een verboden zone eigen schuld dikke bult
1807867 ik denk dat hij van ons allemaal het meeste talent had
1807868 zodra we vijftig meter hoog waren ging een fel rood lichtje knipperen ach de batterij die wat warm loopt zei hij geen reden om te landen vond hij ik ga gewoon wat lager en trager vliegen en dan komt dat wel voor mekaar zei hij alleen zaten we toen al twintig kilometer ver boven de middellandse zee die dag besliste ik dat ik nooit nog meer hem zou mee vliegen
1807869 we kregen melding van een ongeval en de wedstrijddirecteur reed me naar de plaats van de crash omdat pironi achter ons reed wist ik meteen dat het gilles was zodat ik terugdacht aan onze eerste ontmoeting jaren daarvoor toen hij me zei ik hoop dat ik je nooit nodig heb doc gilles was uit zn ferrari gekatapulteerd en lag in de vanghekken zn hart klopte nog we beademden hem en brachten hem naar het ziekenhuis in leuven toen ik daar de fotos van zn nek en ruggengraat zag wist ik dat het hopeloos was ik belde zn vriend jody scheckter in monaco op en vroeg hem om met mevrouw villeneuve naar belgi te komen ondertussen hielden we gilles kunstmatig in leven toen joanne in leuven aankwam legde ik haar uit dat de situatie uitzichtloos was iets na negen uur is hij toen overleden

1807892 would you let me say what i wanna say gosh youre worse than momo chan
1807893 risako isnt the type to get angry or hold any grudges she has a big heart and accepts everyone so just tell her worst case scenario she wont feel the same
1807894 you can take your time in telling her but my gut tells me she likes you a lot more than a friend should
1807895 you know its weird but you sounded almost like a grown up
1807896 the person you often argue with is usually the person you actually love
1807897 ne rii chan what are you doing out here so late its almost 12 30
1807898 w well i i was going to go to my room and but
1807899 so why dont you go downstairs to the lobby and ask for another key card
1807900 i i thought itd bother those hard working workers and i didnt want to burden them with a silly matter like this
1807901 so basically youd rather sleep in the halls on the floor
1807902 why do you always make up some stupid lie and cant admit youre just too scared to go to the lobby by yourself
1807903 well do you really want to sleep in the halls tonight or do you want to sleep in a comfy bed
1807904 listen i didnt mean to sound its late and im tired

1807906 well you and i are about the same size so ill just lend you one of my pjs
1807907 its not like we havent shared a bed before rii chan
1807908 we can always fight for the bed loser takes the couch
1807909 well it seems fair deal fight for the bed eternal gloating to the loser and oh a nice warm bed all to the winners self while the loser sleeps on the couch
1807910 whatever well just share the bed its late im tired i want sleep
1807911 those are dirty they might as well be garbage bags
1807912 they are not dirty just because i dont have frilly night gowns doesnt mean theyre not night wear
1807913 theyre not night wear miya those are your dance practice clothes
1807914 no they dont but they will when you sweat in them and i refuse to wear clothes thats been used and was drowned in other peoples sweat
1807915 no i really dont i havent worn these clothes at all since we got here
1807916 you so did wear them i remember and dont even lie miya i know when youre lying because im a good liar too and liars know liars the way liars do in their lying its a very liar y thing
1807917 dont change the subject those are dirty clothes and im not going to wear them so you might as well dig up clothes that are clean and fresh and not so stinky with miya sweat thanks
1807918 yes yes oh royal majesty anything for the princess of our 7 nin group
1807919 well in all honesty you complain a little too much and you really enjoy being the baby of the group oh and the fact its late tonight and i am exhausted so dont mind me bring a bit cranky
1807920 well maybe you wouldnt be so cranky if you didnt start topics that lead us to argue honestly im pooped from all this arguing i even think i may have lost 2 kilos from all this arguing its like a work out
1807921 really rii chan do you really hear yourself speak sometime its so
1807922 well being locked out of your own room and staying up this late does that to you i call it the talking real funny effect but i know theres a scientific term for it theres always a scientific term for these kinds of things
1807923 well you can change here ill be in the bathroom
1807924 oh okay i i didnt i mean go for it
1807925 if it werent for the fact you were famous the kids would so pick on you
1807926 i changed my mind now scoot over a good 5 feet to the couch so we can get some shut eye
1807927 i i dont think you should stay here in my room
1807928 and i i just i dont like you the same way you want me to
1807929 i dont think so she she looked pretty bad when we saw her at our door
1807930 no she just showed up tears falling and all she didnt say much just it hurts before she fell asleep
1807931 i swear im gonna beat the crap out of who ever did this
1807932 were right there behind you but right now were in the dark here
1807933 im sorry i let this happened to you i was suppose to protect you from all those mean people
1807934 its not your fault maasa if anything we shouldve been there too
1807935 i dont understand she was fine when we saw her
1807936 we wont know what happened between the time she left your room and then came back until she tells us right now were in the dark
1807937 and then what ask her hey rii chan what made you cry last night cause we wanna beat that punk up for you so recount all those horrible memories for us so we can get angrier at the jackass that hurt you its not exactly a comforting thing to say to a girl who looked like her heart got shattered to a billion pieces
1807938 chii were not going to ask that of course no but we have to know whose responsible
1807939 but were kinda forcing her to remember things im sure she doesnt want to remember i think its better if we just left her alone for a while adjust to what happened and then just wait until shes ready to tell us what happened
1807940 if we wait it might be too late things like this hurt a lot im sure as friends we want her to be happy again but if she looked the way you said she did we have to know otherwise shes just going to run away close us off like maiha did
1807941 maiha maiha just didnt tell us it was her fault that she felt that way
1807942 is it i mean come on she wasnt happy and we were too stupid and blind to realize how bad things were for her until it was too late if we realized maybe maybe she would still be here with us
1807943 guys just stop theres no point in self pitying ourselves on things thats been done its in the past and all we can do is hope for the best maihas happy she calls she visits we should be happy with her besides our issue now is rii chan we just gotta wait until shes up and try not to push her for a name so we can run off beating the person who did this
1807944 hey you you look nice in that sun dress and that big sun flower hat
1807945 listen im sorry i showed up last night and bummed in your room
1807946 okay we figured well the way you were we didnt want you to be alone
1807947 well i plan on beating up miya yell at her lecture her then take you out for some ice cream and talk about how miya is such an idiot
1807948 listen youre the youngest in our group and if you showed up the way you did because of miya then i have a bone to pick with that girl even if shes my friend
1807949 that seems so much for a 12 year old to even handle
1807950 there has to be a reason there has to be
1807951 she just doesnt like me kumai chan thats her reason for doing what she did and i dont blame her for it its my fault anyway
1807952 no its not your fault dont even think that if you do ill knock you in some sense
1807953 nah sorry rii chan but im with kumai chan on that one
1807954 better if you just smacked both rii chan and miya
1807955 yeah whenever someone says a real mean thing glaring or pulling a tsukkomi people around here says its like pulling a miki
1807956 i thought pulling a miki was when you grope someones boobs or butt
1807957 you know miya really didnt mean what she said right
1807958 if she didnt meant it she wouldnt have said it
1807959 but she didnt mean it rii chan shes look i know what she did to you was horrible and painful but
1807960 n no its not what you think rii chan listen she really does like you shes just just scared about everything else
1807961 i know its not a good excuse to forgive miya for breaking your heart and hurting you like she did but
1807962 well i never who taught you to be so disrespectful to your mommy
1807963 get dressed well all go out for some ice cream mommy can pay
1807964 lets go to your room and get you changed then
1807965 theres certainly nothing to stop them from pricing that way if they want to
1807966 thats because people interested in higher end machines buy apple while cheap idiots buy pcs
1807967 this case has been mischaracterized there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1807968 but take a look at the website of the lead attorney representing apple
1807969 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
1807970 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1807971 we knew it was a challenging market but we didnt think the market would be that weak
1807972 the real estate market has collapsed out from under us
1807973 quite frankly this was probably the only opportunity i had at least for now
1807974 im really surprised that none of the cdcs current tenants or the neighbors expressed an interest in buying
1807975 i think that you missed the boat by not hiring someone to market the property
1807976 we have a condo project we know will not succeed
1807977 i think its bad faith to expect people to support this and go back on the promise of the cdc to make this a home ownership opportunity
1807978 the noodles themselves arent that bad but its the seasoning packet that freaks people out
1807979 hasnt got as many strange things as a season packet
1807980 natural selection along an environmental gradient a classic cline in mouse pigmentation by lynne m
1807981 well im not really sure if the above example in mouse pigmentation is going to hold up in the long run but hey they did a good job and i see no good reason to discount the study so sure why not lets call it a classic case of cline selection but if more comes in the pipeline that suggests something else hey im open to change
1807982 heres the other one in science fiction when we cant express ourselves if were angry or were upset or emotional we hug and kiss a character or we shoot them or blast them in musical theatre we start singing songs
1807983 in series one we were like a young kid learning how to walk in series two we are up and running we know exactly where we are we know what were about
1807984 i am part of that crazy fan base when i was a child i watched dr who i hid behind the sofa like everybody else
1807985 i knew when i got involved what the history was when captain jack was created it was a great opportunity a great role when they told me i was getting torchwood and they were making me my own show theres the responsibility of the many many years of dr who culture that you kind of have to respect and honour
1807986 before they really got to know me a lot of people in britain thought i was canadian i only speak with a scottish accent when i am with my immediate family or when im up in glasgow
1807987 i am my product in my business i love what i do i enjoy what i do and i see my business being the different aspects of the entertainment industry
1807988 im telling you its true because a british newspaper did try to make out that i was telling a lie i am telling the story as i know it when i contacted my agent and asked them to find out why i wasnt cast my agent came back and told me i was not gay enough i was too straight
1807989 when the newspaper came out with that i had to defend myself i was a little bit angry because i wouldnt lie about something like that its just totally hysterical that a gay man was not gay enough to play the part of a gay character
1807990 this is a hamlet of quicksilver intelligence mimetic vigour and wild humour one of the funniest ive ever seen
1807991 i have seen bolder hamlets but few who kept me so riveted
1807992 for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1807993 some parts of the role particularly the manlier more noble elements are underplayed mr tennant is also upstaged by a deliciously subtle turn from patrick stewart as the wicked but practical king claudius
1807994 the jet lag is really quite appalling when you come on such a short trip
1807995 moffat the shows incoming head writer and an executive producer fell asleep at dinner twice
1807996 i had teas with nbc entertainment co chairman ben silverman a month after that
1807997 were all still friends just slagging each other off its just television
1807998 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
1807999 saying what would happen if i press every button at once
1808000 i think creatively what russells achieved across those three shows is a coherence actually
1808001 its not something were going to start doing every week
1808002 the first reaction i think was that its a sign of failure from 13 episodes to five that doesnt have to be the case torchwood did brilliant business in the uk
1808003 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show everyones hard on everyone and im part of that process too we dont all wear slippers and velvet jackets and have chats over sherry
1808004 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
1808005 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for its a family title its an interesting intellectual puzzle about how best to place it
1808006 when the next season is available sure well be interested definitely interested
1808007 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
1808008 there was a lot of crying on the production i have to say
1808009 when we first cast david one of the very first questions he was asked was when are you leaving and youre like hold on enjoy the journey
1808010 ill be able to watch doctor who as a punter
1808011 the jet lag is really quite appalling when you come on such a short trip
1808012 moffat the shows incoming head writer and an executive producer fell asleep at dinner twice
1808013 i had teas with nbc entertainment co chairman ben silverman a month after that
1808014 were all still friends just slagging each other off its just television
1808015 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
1808016 saying what would happen if i press every button at once
1808017 i think creatively what russells achieved across those three shows is a coherence actually
1808018 its not something were going to start doing every week
1808019 the first reaction i think was that its a sign of failure from 13 episodes to five that doesnt have to be the case torchwood did brilliant business in the uk
1808020 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show everyones hard on everyone and im part of that process too we dont all wear slippers and velvet jackets and have chats over sherry
1808021 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
1808022 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for its a family title its an interesting intellectual puzzle about how best to place it
1808023 when the next season is available sure well be interested definitely interested
1808024 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
1808025 there was a lot of crying on the production i have to say
1808026 when we first cast david one of the very first questions he was asked was when are you leaving and youre like hold on enjoy the journey
1808027 ill be able to watch doctor who as a punter
1808028 their guilty conscience about leaving behind their less fortunate more patriotic blood cousins
1808029 leaders inspire people and believe in the future while managers control people to behave
1808030 if a man cannot take your hint drive it into him with a rice pounder
1808031 acknowledging your inclination for claiming blog victories is as pronounced as your penchant for cl
1808032 strange it is blacker that even though im supposed to be asking the same questions the answers
1808033 saw the best minds of his generation destroyed by madness starving

1808035 es grave que en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1808036 que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores
1808037 la verdad es que si hubi semos sabido que el logo del cicr se hab a utilizado desde un principio de la operaci n lo hubi ramos dicho no hay ning n problema
1808038 el gobierno del presidente uribe y yo hemos procurado decir siempre la verdad cuando la conocemos a adi

1808041 i think its a great day in the state of mississippi for justice
1808042 obviously everybody wants to have credible competent witnesses particularly when theyre expert witnesses
1808043 wed look far more favorably at an urgent care clinic that was accredited than one that wasnt
1808044 it means an organization is taking a hard look at a variety of safety issues that should be involved in caring for someone who is acutely ill
1808045 if it is a good high quality urgent care center that can keep someone out of the emergency department who doesnt need to be there that is a good thing
1808046 one of our concerns that people cant recognize when they have an emergency or dont
1808047 a patient who says they are having indigestion and goes to an urgent care clinic may really be having a heart attack
1808048 we dont encourage patients with chest pain to go to urgent care centers but the reality is that we need to be prepared for anything that walks through our doors
1808049 research a facility first to be sure they are going to be seen by a physician and that the facility will be able to provide all of the necessary services that might be required

1808061 he will probably play the week after so it gives him one or two games at williamstown and then maybe one or two in the seniors before the finals
1808062 under an arthroscope the bone is still a bit soft but he cant do any more damage to it so hes just got to get through that pain barrier and we know hes a very tough individual
1808063 its just a matter of getting some games into him and having that match conditioning
1808064 higgins as a younger player hes needing longer than a scott west would
1808065 you feel for him because his injuries have been anything but minor hes more than frustrated and he was very upset on the weekend but the scan and prognosis is a lot better than we thought it would be so that should give him some hope
1808066 were not resting anyone i used the wrong word i suppose a better way of putting it is we have a no risk policy
1808067 anyone we think might be at risk on the weekend wont play but we wont be resting any player just for rests sake
1808068 you dont want to lose the last four games and then all of sudden you come into finals without any form behind you
1808069 in a country that claims to embrace democratic ideals police have no business telling newspaper editors what political coverage they can and cannot run
1808070 the authorities must stop these crude attempts at intimidation and censorship and allow awramba times to publish the news it wants
1808071 the defendant did not deny his plan to lodge complaints against the judge
1808072 this is an assault on the human and professional integrity of the judge while it obstructs him from determining on the case with free conscience it displays contempt to the constitutional independence of the judiciary

1808085 our vehicle finance portfolio actually improved credit quality over the period
1808086 but the business does not have sufficient critical mass or the pricing power to provide an acceptable return to the group
1808087 august 6th 2008 at 3 01 pm hsbcs name written in chinese translates to hong kong shanghai silver company their headquarters in hong kong is pictured on the hk money we put old government buildings on ours think about the responsibility hsbc has to its masters and youll understand why this is big the hong kong based banking house
1808088 without a reliable source for this critical part we will be unable to produce the hybrid vehicle in accordance with its scheduled launch date and will likely be forced to either cancel the vehicle entirely or delay the launch for an extended period in order to identify and develop a substitute battery and to redesign other portions of the vehicle to accommodate it

1808091 but oracle enterprise linux is fully compatible with red hat linux its just like red hat really but minus the logos and trademarks we just take the source code and strip that off

1808093 yougovs latest survey for the daily telegraph suggests that the principal political divide nowadays is not between the conservatives and labour but between the british people and almost the whole of the countrys political class
1808094 fully 36 per cent a huge proportion by post war standards seem disposed to turn their backs on the whole lot never before has the none of the above party recruited so many adherents
1808095 we should demand that there be a none of the above or skip this race issue option on every ballot whether paper or electronic
1808096 state assemblyman don mello sponsored the 1975 legislation to stimulate voter turnout by providing an alternative to voting for candidates who are either not popular or little known another goal of the measure is to allow voters to express dissatisfaction with the quality of candidates or the nature of election campaigns
1808097 70 percent of his listeners who responded to an online poll said theyd rather vote for zippy the squirrel than rod blagojevich or judy baar topinka in illinois upcoming gubernatorial election
1808098 i think people are fed up with the republicans and democrats doing business as usual people want new ideas and an openness that is not connected to the big money being given to candidates in the political parties
1808099 some experts worry that a voter boycott of primaries could result in politics being dominated by single issue special interest groups
1808100 thus and too often the voting public takes the fall for staying away from the polls even when the reason is their conviction that the only choices available to them are dumb and dumber how about none of the above
1808101 not enough of us are voting the corrupt ones out of office
1808102 sandra brinker often finds herself in the voting booth debating the lesser of two evils sometimes she says she wishes for a box at the bottom labeled none of the above
1808103 is one way for the people to tell the power structure they are not happy if two rascals are running for the same office and neither belongs there why would you want to vote for either one if you dont vote at all your vote is not tallied a vote for none of the above is
1808104 because the enactment of nota election laws transfers some of the power now exercised by the major political party organizations directly to the voters it will take an enormous sustained effort by many individuals and organizations to make the idea of a permanent binding none of the above a reality on the ballot
1808105 the first record makes the idea of who you are for people who havent seen you nothing to gauge it against
1808106 and the second one now theres something to compare it to
1808107 office labs is a proving ground for ideas that come from regular employees and interns who work anywhere in microsoft

1808113 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1808114 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1808115 we havent had everything go right this year so we are pretty happy to be in this position
1808116 we still have to go out and race has hard as we can every week i have learned not to let the point situation stress me out i just go out and race and do the best i can and things will fall the way they are supposed to
1808117 i think if we keep up the performance we have had for the last five or six weeks and dont have anything major go wrong we will be ok
1808118 results speak for themselves we just need to go out there and make it happen
1808119 with every corner theres a different rhythm to it even on an oval but its repetitive
1808120 indy might be one of the hardest ovals because each corner is so different id put pocono maybe second most intense mentally
1808121 but when you get to a road course youve got to turn left turn right hard braking zones and intermediate braking zones downshifts and up shifts there is a lot of stuff going on over the course of a lap on a road course
1808122 the tracks that weve been at here recently are pretty unique and tracks that we wont see in the chase
1808123 so were telling ourselves weve still got a lot of work ahead weve still got a lot of testing planned for the season

1808129 after what happened at watkins glen last year and then almost a repeat this year at add comment
1808130 i cant say road courses are my favorite places but im beginning to become more comfortable at them
1808131 i went up to watkins glen last week and made a few laps around the track just to familiarize myself with it plus this weekend the nationwide and cup cars are together so that will give me lots of track time to get used to the track
1808132 its crunch time for the chase so we need to hang in there and get a solid run on sunday
1808133 david is not known for his road racing skills but he has definitely come a long way in just a year

1808158 you know we did a little homework and we found out some of the things that he said when governor thompson was governor and governor edgar was governor the same things he says now he was saying back then these are just tactics they are tactics they are politics its the games they play and thats why its so frustrating and so disappointing that you would screw with the lives of people because you have your own political agenda
1808159 i dont think its satisfactory for him to simply say i dont want to get between madigan and the governor he should get involved and have those chicago democrats many of whom are city workers who voted to kill the jobs bill get down there and vote to create this jobs bill stimulate our economy and help chicago

1808210 als we met elf tegen elf en bij een 1 1 stand het laatste kwartier waren ingegaan had alles nog gekund
1808211 maar bate was degelijk georganiseerd en wij hadden weinig kansen bij ons lopen sommige spelers achter hun beste vorm aan
1808212 ik ben ontzettend ontgoocheld dit is een enorme opdoffer ik heb een slecht gevoel
1808213 we zullen een dag of twee nodig hebben om dit te verwerken en daarna volgt de evaluatie we zullen zien hoe we het gemis aan inkomsten opvangen
1808214 we waren niet goed genoeg alles liep fout niks was goed vandaag
1808215 we gaven te veel kansen weg en hadden zelf te weinig kansen dit is de grootste ontgoocheling in mijn carri re
1808216 we hebben het onszelf moeilijk gemaakt we hebben het twee keer zelf weggegeven met die rode kaarten
1808217 ik vond ons goed beginnen met veel druk naar voren een goeie balcirculatie en veel overtuiging
1808218 maar na een tijdje verwaterde dat en ging het evenwicht uit de ploeg toch vond ik die 1 1 bij de rust ideaal
1808219 maar bate was veel realistischer met minder middelen het speelde vinniger en gaf onze spitsen weinig ruimte er waren nog een paar schermutselingen voor doel maar we kwamen te laat
1808220 of ik verwacht dat bepaalde spelers de club nu zullen verlaten als je uitgeschakeld bent moet je ook het financi le plaatje bekijken je moet nagaan hoe je met transfers je economische verlies kunt goedmaken
1808221 bate is een ploeg die we altijd moeten elimineren maar opnieuw kregen we een rode kaart toen we alles in handen hadden
1808222 bij die 1 1 geloofde ik er nog in zeker wie was eigenlijk de agressiefste ploeg op dit veld wie probeerde constant tijd te winnen weer hadden we een scheidsrechter die niks van voetbal kent sorry maar het is zo en noem me dan maar een slechte verliezer

1808226 i spent one hundred and fifty dollars to get this book and they are going to give me only fifteen bucks for it
1808227 i may take some of those classes next semester maybe i will buy your books
1808228 from the beginning i saw writing as a aggressive act
1808229 i want you to be actively engaged i dont care if you laugh scream cry throw up whatever but i like to get a reaction
1808230 i dont like him i dont respect his books because every one is the same
1808231 recently stephen king commented that he doesnt have any respect for me doesnt make too much a good dad a nice husband my only crime is ive sold millions of books as far as 1408 goes what can i say i liked it the first third is
1808232 ernest hemingway always said his influence was cezzane i really cant point to any one person in particular there was a book at thompson on creativity that i avoided but was then forced to read for a
1808233 the point that really struck me because it was true about the limitations of my own creativity is that there is very little completely creative out of nowhere stuff that appears
1808234 for instance this past summer i forced myself to pay attention to things ive missed
1808235 i read 150 books a year im just re reading leonard michaels the short story writer from the 50s and 60s it depends on what im in the mood for at any given time right now im reading a fair number of political books ill probably read one of the hillary clinton
1808236 im the literary version of the grateful dead i guess im not a big fan of psychoanalysis i think if you have mental problems what you need are good pills but i do think that if you have thinks that bother you things that are unresolved the more that you talk about them write about them the less serious they become at least thats how i see my work in retrospect
1808237 i had one person in alexandria minnesota who raised his hand and said my paychecks going up like 50 percent
1808238 he said i was unemployed and now ive got a paycheck
1808239 you are a union that is proud of achieving a muslim holiday and prayer room
1808240 a union in the u s a a country based on christianity you call yourselves americans have you forgotten 9 11
1808241 you had no right to drop labor day muslim employees must integrate labor day into their lives if they are going to live in america
1808242 we in the labor movement have always understood that unions are only strong when we work to protect the dignity of all faiths and that includes muslims
1808243 we had worked 23 labor days in a row it wasnt like it was a day to spend with our family
1808244 contrary to recent reports labor day is still a holiday at tyson foods the issue concerns only the plant at shelbyville
1808245 we in the labor movement have always understood that unions are only strong when we work to protect the dignity of all faiths and that includes muslims

1808253 we are making this a day long tour to get out and meet residents enlist their support for this important campaign and continue to spread the message we launched this campaign to wake people up but we cant do it alone so we need every person to warn their neighbors their co workers their family and their friends about the deadly consequences of speeding
1808254 we have worked diligently over the past seven years to ensure that our roadways are safe for all of our residents and visitors and this campaign is just another way of reinforcing the importance of safe driving statewide i applaud our residents for taking such an interest in this campaign and working with deldot and our law enforcement agencies to spread the word
1808255 this is an excellent program and its time to get the word out that there are a great deal of people walking and children playing in neighborhoods especially with school starting soon more children will be on the roads everyone should feel safe and this program keeps us all safer
1808256 this is an issue im pleased to partner with deldot on because ive seen the near misses myself in my own neighborhood it started when i saw one of my neighbors children riding their bicycle out of their driveway and almost got hit by a driver in a car racing by
1808257 the message we are partnering with deldot on is very important to the safety of all our children dont let a small mistake result in a fatality drive 25 mph and give our children a chance to survive
1808258 our community experiences high volumes of both vehicle and pedestrian traffic providing the safest environment for our children and the children of surrounding communities as they play and walk to school is of the highest priority the awareness campaigns such as the 25 not 35 program are a great benefit to community safety we appreciate the effort deldot is making
1808259 patricks experience on various boards and committees throughout his community and our state has prepared him well for his new position
1808260 i look forward to the new perspective and positive change he will bring to our state board of education
1808261 i am honored by my appointment to the state board of education
1808262 i look forward to working with the secretary my fellow board members and staff at the department of education to build on the gains our students have already made
1808263 thousands of migrating shorebirds stop at the pond to feed in august and september and flocks of ducks and geese converge on the pond in winter so these areas need to remain protected
1808264 one amaranth has already been found at gordons pond and since they dont typically emerge until late summer it is expected that more will be found as the season progresses
1808265 before these changes in many cases the cost of violating the law was cheaper than paying the proper fee for the activity that didnt serve as much of a deterrent for some people we hope that higher fines will make people think twice before they violate our regulations
1808266 we prefer not to give tickets to people who come to our parks
1808267 we just want to have compliance with park rules and regulations they are laws the same as traffic or any other laws in the state and visitors to our parks must follow these laws
1808268 the delaware division of parks and recreation is heavily supported by fees collected for activities in our parks including surf fishing camping entrance fees and annual passes these fees go right back into the parks to help pay for staff maintenance and improvements
1808269 our parking fines are now consistent with those of our neighboring municipalities

1808273 ini salah satu contoh mengapa rumah panjang tetap dipertahankan terutama oleh masyarakat dayak iban
1808274 selain itu tinggal di rumah panjang bermanfaat untuk memelihara rasa kekeluargaan
1808275 sebelum tahun 1960 an kalau salah seorang penghuni rumah panjang memperoleh ikan dan hasil buruan lainnya perolehan itu dibagi bagi dan dimakan bersama sama namun kini warga makin memahami nilai ekonomi sehingga hasil buruan dijual ke sesama penghuni rumah panjang
1808276 dulu penghuni rumah panjang hanya menggunakan cawat sekarang sudah mengenakan celana
1808277 karena mereka tidak lagi tinggal di rumah panjang dan merantau tinggal di kota pemahaman mereka terhadap budaya dayak makin hilang terus terang banyak anak muda dayak yang tidak bisa menampilkan kesenian dan kebudayaan dayak
1808278 kebanyakan anak muda merantau ke kota ketika kembali ke rumah panjang
1808279 pembongkaran rumah rumah panjang berdampak negatif terhadap pola hidup masyarakat di pedalaman sebab perumahan pola tempat tinggal suku dayak dari rumah panjang ke rumah tunggal mendorong berkembangnya sikap individualistis

1808293 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1808294 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1808295 they may not have hit a home run but at least they hit a triple
1808296 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1808297 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial

1808310 we have approximately a nine month inventory of homes presently
1808311 ideally you have six or less that sort of balances between a sellers market and a buyers market
1808312 there are many consumers who are well positioned to buy a home but they lack confidence they lack incentive to jump into the marketplace
1808313 when people own a home they invest in their neighborhoods more they contribute to their communities more and when people find some financial security and they dont have to worry about losing their home they put money back into the economy
1808314 its a measure to try to build confidence as well as to try to stabilize the situation

1808336 the nice thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every cell type in the body the difficult thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every type of cell in the body
1808337 and so when you push them to specialize they tend to make different cell types were trying to control that process and identify the genes that get the cells down a pathway and then hold them at the start
1808338 our goal is to recreate what happens in the embryo but in the dish
1808339 and so for us this is truly a step forward in understanding what genes can control cell fate and use them to make clinically relevant tissue

1808347 the people side of it is probably the most difficult getting everybody on the same team
1808348 it sounds crazy you would think everybody working together would be on the same team anyway but you have a lot of cliques a lot of groups theres a lot of egos in this sport so trying to get everybody to work together and be a team to make the best product that we can possibly make and bring it to the racetrack every weekend has probably been the hardest thing

1808363 doesnt that sound a little pathetic after you have said it
1808364 that isnt very nice i am a little chubby and i dont have the work out gene i am going against my nature to go to the gym
1808365 i understand that going to the gym and working out everyday is a crunch to your schedule and difficult to do but dont you feel a little better after you have been going

1808375 it is a serious matter that members of the armed forces clandestinely leaked news without coordination with their superiors
1808376 cnn declined to buy the material at the price being asked it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images
1808377 said that when the helicopter was about to land he saw so many guerrillas that he got terribly nervous and fearing for his life he pulled a piece of cloth with the red cross emblem out of his pocket and put it over his vest
1808378 it is serious that in the initial investigation of the operation the whole truth did not emerge
1808379 serious concern over what appears to have been a deliberate misuse of the red cross emblem
1808380 if authenticated these images would clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
1808381 complete and total respect for the red cross emblem is essential if the icrc is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence
1808382 should not tarnish the results of the operation which we are all still celebrating
1808383 the information initially obtained from the presidents office was apparently not so accurate
1808384 the emblem was misused with the wrong intentions that is not a good thing because humanitarian efforts could be affected
1808385 a violation of international humanitarian law whether or not it generates security problems

1808393 the iphone keeps eating into the potential service opportunities carriers and others are trying to create
1808394 the response to the app store has been dramatic enough that others will have to come up with one of their own
1808395 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1808396 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1808397 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say we screwed up
1808398 in their postevent examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1808399 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1808400 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in the cloud like mobileme
1808401 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1808402 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch
1808403 people say this is even better than all the rumors

1808524 what is design the answers are provided by five masters in the design interviews collection
1808525 i have a few places in mind but havent called anyone yet
1808526 i will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of yhoshafat
1808527 i will enter into judgment there on behalf of my people and my heritage israel whom they scattered among the nations and they divided my land
1808528 and it shall happen in that day that i will make jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples
1808529 deals with any nation in direct relation to how that nation interacts with israel if a nation blesses israel god blesses that nation if a nation curses israel he curses that nation it is that simple
1808530 as you did to israel it will be done to you
1808531 at some point the warning judgments cross over to destruction judgments the destruction judgments will break the nation and stop the interference with plan for israel there is no recovery from destruction judgments it appears hurricane katrina was the first destruction judgment
1808532 is the southern california inferno the second judgment will the atlanta drought be the third what is next
1808533 god takes his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob very seriously the judgments begin after a nation hardens its heart and is adamant against his word it appears that the rebellion and unbelief in word has now taken america to the brink of destruction judgments
1808534 apart from the purely scientific goal of a comprehensive study of the climate and seabed at the north pole this expedition may help russia to enlarge its territory by more than one million square kilometers
1808535 our mission is to remind the whole world that russia is a great polar and research power
1808536 i dont give a damn what all these foreign politicians there are saying about this
1808537 if someone doesnt like this let them go down themselves and then try to put something there russia must win russia has what it takes to win
1808538 no one ever refused to take a child from me
1808539 i still hear the cries when they left their parents
1808540 i remember your face he said it was you who took me out of the ghetto i had many calls like that
1808541 i dream of hanging a huge map of the world on the wall at my gaza home which does not show israel on it
1808542 i hope that our dream to have our independent state on all historic palestine will materialize
1808543 will become real one day im certain of this because there is no place for the state of israel on this land
1808544 for i will take you from among the nations gather you out of all the countries and bring you into your own land then i will sprinkle clean water on you and you shall be clean i will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you i will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will keep my judgments and do them then you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers you shall be my people and i will be your god

1808546 there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
1808547 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice
1808548 id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
1808549 the rapid loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region
1808550 unless gilad shalit is released the rafah crossing will not be reopened
1808551 i think the ceasefire is the only way we can hope to be able to facilitate shalits release
1808552 a truce is referred to in arabic as a hudna typically covering 10 years a hudna is recognized in islamic jurisprudence as a legitimate and binding contract
1808553 if muslims are weak a truce may be made for ten years if necessary for the prophet made a truce with the quraysh for that long as is related by abu dawud
1808554 jerusalem is muslim the blessed al aqsa mosque and harem al sharif temple mount is 100 percent muslim the israelis are playing with fire when they threaten al aqsa with digging that is taking place
1808555 any hurting of jerusalem will explode the whole negotiations between us and the israelis we must work to strengthen palestinian ties to jerusalem
1808556 israel started since 1967 making archeological digs to show jewish signs to prove the relationship between judaism and the city and they found nothing there is no jewish connection to israel before the jews invaded in the 1880s
1808557 about these so called two temples they never existed certainly not at the temple mount
1808558 all this is not real we dont believe in all your versions your torah was falsified the text as given to the muslim prophet moses never mentions jerusalem maybe jerusalem was mentioned in the rest of the torah which was falsified by the jews
1808559 prophets for the israelites sent by allah as to usher in islam
1808560 the western wall is the western wall of the al aqsa mosque its where prophet muhammad tied his animal which took him from mecca to jerusalem to receive the revelations of allah
1808561 al aqsa was build by the angels forty years after the building of al haram in mecca this we have no doubt is true
1808562 in jerusalem there is not a place one calls sacred and the same holds true for the tombs of hebron
1808563 the first commandment when it left the mouth of the holy one as meteors and lightning and as torches of fire a fiery torch to its right and a fiery torch to its left which burst forth and flew in the air of the heavenly expanse it proceeded to circle around the camp of israel

1808571 an estimated one million persons in the united states are living with hiv aids with approximately one fourth of these cases attributable to injection drug use
1808572 this paper provides important evidence for the value of routinely providing haart therapy to hiv infected injection drug users who need treatment benefiting both the patients and the public at large
1808573 hopefully the findings from this study help address the commonly held assumption that hiv positive injection drug users do not derive the full benefits of hiv treatment
1808574 we have an ethical and human rights imperative to deliver hiv care to this population not only to reduce illness and death but also to possibly reduce the rate of new infections in the community
1808575 the result is that concession card holders rely on episodic relief of pain instead of having checks

1808589 some parts of the body are evil and should not be acknowledged we should be thankful for the christian librarians who show us the righteous path
1808590 as a father of a daughter i am thankful that this is being discussed maybe there should be separate shelf in the library where particular books that have questionable content are shelved or maybe some sticker that would alert a parent that there is something in this book that needs to be reviewed beforehand

1808634 the remarkable thing was that while silencing these genes individually was effective silencing the quartet nearly completely eliminated tumour growth and spread
1808635 we found that the combination of these two inhibitory drugs was effective even though the drugs individually were not very effective
1808636 this really nailed the case that if we can inactivate these genes in concert it will affect metastasis

1808671 ill do my best its probably just a simple misunderstanding
1808672 its when your imam says take that homosexual man and throw him off the mountain isnt that advocating violence against homosexuals
1808673 no dont be silly thats very easily explained its been taken out of context
1808674 what context could possibly make it acceptable to throw a homosexual off a mountain
1808675 simple our imam was going through the list of mosque activities for the next week hed dealt with the ladies afternoon jam making group on tuesday afternoon quince and plum i think it was and then the extra team practice for the quran memorisation team an important semi final coming up you know and then he went on to talk about the evening trip for the support group for muslim homosexuals lesbians bisexual and transgendered
1808676 well they were all going to the local leisure centre for the evening play lots of games activities that sort of thing helps build morale and relationships and help them through their difficulties one of their favourites is going on the climbing wall its all very safe with ropes and helmets and such like but what they like to do is climb up and push one another off then they go and have burgers and milk shakes
1808677 yes and they call the game take that homosexual man and throw him off the mountain
1808678 oh i see so its a very simple explanation and it all depends on the context
1808679 exactly now you understand it all depends on the context
1808680 depends on the context again hey charles id love to stay and talk with you but its bingo night tonight and im the caller

1808691 if someone like mr asbahi cant be vetted to work for the obama campaign then who can
1808692 i commend the military officers who presided over this trial and served on the hearing panel under difficult and unprecedented circumstances they and all our armed forces continue to serve this country with valor in the fight against terrorism that the hamdan trial the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9 11 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill usama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3000 americans
1808693 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act mca this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward i supported that legislation which was a good faith effort by congress to meet the supreme courts direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial salim ahmed hamdan a trusted confidante of usama bin laden was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1808694 the coup in mauritania robs the countrys voters of their basic rights to freely elect their leaders and hold them accountable at the ballot box
1808695 it is a damaging blow not only to mauritania but also to the african continent which as a whole has seen democratic gains in recent years
1808696 the au statement on mauritania represents a new trend emerging in which more african leaders are breaking their self imposed code of silence in order to speak out in defense of democracy and human rights
1808697 the au has a pivotal role to play in advancing democratic governance on the continent

1808719 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
1808720 the election law should not be held hostage to the kirkuk problem
1808721 it is possible a special session could be held before this time but this is unlikely
1808722 an important opportunity to pass an elections law was missed today
1808723 our stance is to go ahead with the bill and not postpone it with great regret what happened has happened and it was not our fault

1808728 what we need today is an economic surge our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
1808729 we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america
1808730 we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of health care and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
1808731 john mccain started running an ad yesterday saying that washington is broken no kidding
1808732 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and then not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when youre seeking your parties nomination
1808733 john mccain is not a bad man but he is badly mistaken when he has embraced the bush and cheney economic policies and he is badly mistaken when he has embraced their energy policies someone was telling me this morning that his solution to the american energy challenge was to drill drill drill well it sounded a lot like my dentist to me
1808734 for details also theres a new jott application available for the iphone from the itunes app store however the free application simply records your voice memos then sends transcribed versions to the iphones jott application and posts them online to your jott account
1808735 im so sorry that was my dog walker and it seems my dear cujo just broke his leash and well ive got to run
1808736 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1808737 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1808738 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1808739 in five short months the bush administration will be done

1808742 its a quality movie even if the material is unworthy of the treatment
1808743 is the biggest proponent of george bushs tired failed policies ready to bring about change
1808744 while sen mccain knows that sen obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1808745 sen mccain and his party mocked the idea and they even sent out tire gauges
1808746 well get this last night after all that sen mccain actually said that he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea
1808747 we just agreed to a series of debates in the fall but the most interesting one thats going on these days is the debate between john mccain and john mccain
1808748 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
1808749 he has promised tax increases on income tax increases on investment tax increases on small businesses
1808750 thats exactly exactly the wrong strategy raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you can do
1808751 to be honest i cant even turn on sportscenter anymore

1808754 i got a lot of messages on my cell phone theres a lot of speculation out there i dont want to fuel any reports
1808755 im just going to be real careful saying anything right now because i dont have all the facts nor do you and maybe you have more than me
1808756 i dont want to be evasive i really dont feel its my point or my purpose to address a lot of issues that i dont know a lot about do i know brett favre yes i know brett favre do i respect him yes i do but i also have a football team here that i am accountable to and i dont want to answer any other questions at this point in time

1808780 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets

1808783 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly

1808814 instead the record shows gen mattis to be an independent commander highly unlikely to be prone to manipulation by his staff officers
1808815 gen mattis used the word never 10 times in answering questions about whether col ewers had provided any legal advice with respect to chessanis case or any haditha case

1808862 my grandparents had this tiny lake cottage up north and wed always stop and get corn on our way up my grandmother would always taste it and say sweet as sugar every time thats what sweet corn is so incredibly sweet and incredibly perfect when its good its great with nothing on it but salt and butter by the end of the summer im done with it because weve eaten so much of it
1808863 weve got sweet corn all over the menu right now we have a simple pur ed sweet corn soup and a composition of four dishes as a vegetarian entree sweet corn pancakes a sweet corn flan a sweet corn arugula salad and a sweet corn ricotta mousse i like the sweet corn calamari combination so im playing with it to replace the halibut thats on the menu pauses now im thinking that maybe i have too much sweet corn on the menu laughs but its so good i mean i love sweet corn who doesnt love sweet corn
1808864 we saw it for the first time today at the farmers market sweet corn is like tomatoes i always forget how good it is i have a 4 year old and he loves corn on the cob with a little squeeze of lime some butter some salt i love watching him enjoy it and i love learning to love something all over again through his eyes thats really cool he likes to eat it typewriter style you know id forgotten that thats beautiful
1808865 i grew up with canned corn and frozen corn so it wasnt until i was here visiting my in laws in august that i changed my mind about sweet corn when i could go out and pick it and eat it right there thats when you get that incredible crunchy texture and creaminess when you pick it yourself i like it grilled more than anything with sea salt and a fruity extra virgin olive oil its perfect with the cob right over the charcoal a little bit of char on it just that great simplicity

1808885 historically cash guests were not regarded as very important to the atlantic city gaming industry
1808886 cash guests are increasingly attractive because they appreciate everything our properties offer they enjoy the shows shopping and our restaurants and clubs growing this segment is one strategy helping us in the softer market this also dovetails with atlantic citys program to market itself as a destination offering more than gaming
1808887 we manage our availability and set rates based on total guest value not just room rate so the right guests always have a room at our properties
1808888 adding these rooms in a soft market has created an opportunity for us to fill the void
1808889 to drive more business we aggressively stepped up marketing efforts and were successful with tv and print media promotions geared toward non gaming customers
1808890 the rainmaker software helps us forecast our cash customer demand independently from our casino business so we can say on any given day what our booking pace is and what our demand appears to be for our cash customers
1808891 we were compiling a considerable amount of data manually to make determinations about forecasted customer demand by customer worth
1808892 our old method of data gathering and forecasting was outdated now we are receiving that information automatically and are able to identify current customer trends more quickly these trends are subsequently compared to year over year performance by calendar date the resulting data enables us to perform accurate forecast modeling to effectively set rates and availability by customer value thus laying the groundwork for revenue optimization of the resort

1808919 its a healing process to get together and be with people you served with overseas
1808920 we were around combat quite a bit and the physical and mental wounds from that need healing its hard to talk about it at all

1808941 there is a tendency among venture capital funds to make large benefits at the shortest possible time
1808942 venture capital as a category has a tremendous role to play it is a difficult area to regulate
1808943 we need to know the volume of investment made by venture capitalists in the country

1808955 it is a great day when im asked to reenlist soldiers in the army and it is an honor for me to be here with you today
1808956 it is an honor for me to be able to administer your oath again and understand the commitment you are all taking on personally and professionally for your country for our army and for yourselves
1808957 now that we have reached our goal we are beginning to shift our focus over to the new fiscal year
1808958 i expect that we will have a few more soldiers who will want to reenlist right now most will wait until october with the new bonuses and career options that will become available
1808959 when a soldier comes into our office he or she has more than likely already made up their minds whether or not they want to reenlist its our job to help push them in the right direction
1808960 money is always important to a soldier and should be but most of them look at it as a small incentive to what they really want and that is to move into positions that provide promising futures and continued career enhancement
1808961 for the most part i have enjoyed my army experience and im trying to take advantage of all the benefits the army has to offer
1808962 everyone has their own reason for staying in the army for me it was the opportunity to go back to school
1808963 they sell our phones and service but they dont have to comply with verizons pricing
1808964 ill leave the phone in the car and just take the bluetooth headset
1808965 yes bluetooth does a better job in this situation of communicating through this structure it can go through walls and while signals can be affected by metal and other barriers it does a better job than some other wireless technologies at overcoming that
1808966 youre trying to find a needle in a haystack and you dont care what the needle is our customers are on a mission to find the people theyre looking for its critical that we float up to the top of the results set the person theyre looking for
1808967 if they are around swift water they need to have on a life jacket
1808968 i didnt know there were different types of life jackets
1808969 this may not help us in iraq but if were needed for water rescue in our state then this is valuable training
1808970 we have the same military occupational specialty and are from the same unit weve learned and trained together shes got my back and ive got her back so it only makes sense that we deploy together
1808971 a large portion of our unit is made up of volunteers from other units and everyone is extremely motivated
1808972 it really helps that we had experienced veterans for our trainers and instructors
1808973 also you can also see the units awesome cohesion come out in the training lanes both of which make preparation for deployment a lot easier
1808974 i look forward to working well as a team overseas and making sure that everyone returns exactly the way they left or even better
1808975 i think people that attack the innocent people are not real human beings they are like animals
1808976 even the people they know the risk but theyre showing the terrorists that theyre not afraid by coming to the market
1808977 they are criminals and they are not welcome in this neighborhood
1808978 i want to say something too thats enough there have been too many people killed and injured no more blood
1808979 forget the wouldas shouldas and couldas windows vista is a far better operating system than windows xp
1808980 is vista an excellent version of windows yes its better than xp
1808981 i do think that at its core the vista kernel is better than xps but i also wrote in the same review im so unsure that i like vistas trade offs like
1808982 federal dollars pay a large amount of the money toward people in the last 30 days of their life we have to make a decision are we doing to invest in things that are going to help a lot of people broadly or in things that help a narrow band of people a lot of people knock britain but they have a much better information infrastructure because they have very different spending priorities and their spending as a percent of gdp is a lot lower
1808983 there is no obvious authority or incentives to interconnect these electronic medical record systems it gets down to politics we are spent on health care the british and canadians are different they do seem to be making much more substantial investments both with public funds and in aligning the financial systems they use to incent the adoption of electronic heath records that are interoperable
1808984 there are estimates that one in five lab tests and x rays are repeated because the data from the original exam is unavailable at the time a decision must be made there are many options to optimize the return on investment for electronic medical records systems but ultimately the patient benefits in a care delivery model as well as in a framework of preventive medicine
1808985 health care may arguably be the most complex enterprise that exists on the face of the earth having an electronic health records system that supports that is also complex and difficult to do
1808986 if you take an elderly person with ten different doctors there is no one that can assemble all of the health records except for the patient the u s doesnt have a health care system we have a lot of health care providers but there is no system right now the personal health record seems to be the best hope
1808987 there is no such thing as your medical records its scattered across hells half acre at dentists doctors pharmacies with probably 20 medical record systems in different specialities and clinics you are the only place where that data can be assembled in one place the individual deserves to get a copy of that information and let them decide what to do with it it cant be much worse than the current system
1808988 hes a great passer and a good shot blocker with tremendous timing the low post is not what i would consider one of his strong points it never was and hasnt been yet
1808989 although some theories date the trulli back 5000 years the favorite story of their creation claims that such buildings were first constructed during the middle ages
1808990 at the time anyone who built a dwelling on the kings land was heavily taxed with this in mind the pugliesi cleverly devised the drywall stone trulli solely for purposes of tax evasion
1808991 as the story goes upon word of the taxmans arrival the trulli were rapidly dismantled and moved out of sight after the visit was over the homes were re erected nowadays trulli are firmly planted and buttressed with stucco
1808992 the hearth remains the source of heat to this day luckily the region is fairly warm and the cool stone trulli provide relief from the hot summer sun fanciful hex signs adorning each home add magic to the already bewitching setting
1808993 the local sandstone tinged a warm pink is so easy to work with that it fostered the rise of a local style
1808994 in 1072 when most christian rulers were sharpening their swords and locking up their women in preparation for the crusades the normans conquered sicily rather than strip their new conquest of its considerable wealth the normans decided to settle and encouraged the resident arabs and byzantines greeks and italians to do the same and live together at a time of global conflict sicily emerged as a model of cooperation out of this came the palatine chapel palermos most impressive visual treat the builders of the chapel understood that drama relies on contrast to reach the chapel you must walk up a bare stone staircase and across a courtyard of vaults and cloisters inside arab byzantine and norman traditions combine to create a dazzling interior exquisite mosaics of gold blues and greens run up against carved wooden ceilings painted into arabesques soaring images of jesus are surrounded by ranks of saints and rows of trees the exquisite artistry brought out by the glitter of gold and a blaze of colour

1808997 tourism developed when underwater diving enthusiasts came to explore the surrounding beautifully limpid waters and wonderfully scraggy coastline in 1987 it was designated a marine national park
1808998 in the 6th century a benedictine community settled in the island but was soon forced to move because of ongoing wars between europeans and arabs attempts to colonize the island in the middle ages failed because of raids by barbary pirates
1808999 in the mid 1700s the island was settled by approximately 90 people from the island of lipari east of ustica
1809000 in the the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s as the population of the island grew too large hundreds of ustican families emigrated to the united states
1809001 many of these families settled in new orleans and surrounding areas where there are today thousands of descendants whose ties remain strong to ustica a smaller number of families settled in san francisco san jose and massachusetts
1809002 the sea around ustica is especially clean and provides ideal conditions for multitudes of different species of aquatic flora and fauna to live and proliferate

1809014 i dont know if the average ordinary israeli likes living under the international media spotlight
1809015 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
1809016 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
1809017 virtually none of the evidence we wanted to present was presented
1809018 in that sense its not that surprising that the jury came to the decision it did
1809019 i think all of us sometimes choose to hear what we want to hear

1809025 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1809026 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1809027 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1809028 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it

1809034 the games for windows team and the games for windows live team looked at this and said what do we need to do to make sure this adopted broadly and has value
1809035 and thats all those changes the ui the marketplace the fact that were not going to have the same content on xbox live i think theyve done everything to continue to add value to the gold subscription
1809036 that is not something this group is prepared to offer

1809063 at present the 83 million in federal fuel assistance funds for massachusetts will provide a maximum benefit of 503 for the poorest families in a program serving 150 000 low income households
1809064 with heating oil predicted at 5 a gallon or more it will take 1 375 to fill an oil tank families need about three tanks to get through the winter its beyond scary
1809065 heating oil prices have jumped 85 percent from this time last year
1809066 and natural gas prices could easily be 20 percent higher this coming winter leading to even more low income families losing their utility service than last year
1809067 the numbers just dont add up heating oil is 85 percent higher than last year and as of right now only 83 million in federal fuel assistance funds for massachusetts will be available which is half the amount of last years home heating assistance funding the national consumer law center shows that there are over 120 000 gas and electric customers who are still in arrears on their bills and that tens of thousands will have their service terminated these folks and many many more will be in dire straights this winter
1809068 with todays high energy prices an estimated 250 million is needed to just to keep the heating assistance level the same as last year
1809069 rising energy costs weigh heavily on all our minds right now and i take your concerns very seriously
1809070 to discuss the most effective ways we can deal with the very real concerns you outline in your letter
1809071 its quite natural that when you spend more time in a room youre going to want it to be pleasing to the eye and functional even if that room is the bathroom when youre talking about creating a bathroom home spa thats even more important thats why homeowners should take a step back and consider their options when planning a dream bathroom
1809072 while most people dont create their dream bathroom for their homes next owner it certainly is a nice extra to know it can dramatically improve the value of the entire home

1809099 i dont think they have come to the definite conclusion that we are having a sharp slowdown in growth but they are clearly cautious they do not want to re ignite inflation pressure
1809100 i think there is a bit of gridlock and not a lot of consensus about what to do
1809101 for some senior leaders who have come out and taken personal responsibility for the issues they face some career pressures
1809102 this is a public interest win over special interests its a consumer win over big industry
1809103 the toy industry and the manufacturers were successful over the last 20 years in getting congress to look the other way while the cpsc nearly died from neglect
1809104 its a new day when the cpsc is restored to being a strong regulator no longer something industry can manipulate
1809105 our biggest question right now is getting our life support systems working so we have enough for six person crew
1809106 right now were running kind of a water deficit and its being supplemented by the shuttle
1809107 by getting the crew quarters deployed well have extra bedrooms
1809108 that water is going to be used not just for drinking and food preparation but also for oxygen generation
1809109 and i think thats a key component of life support because i think were all addicted to breathing
1809110 the engineer and scientist in me say yeah its no problem
1809111 on the other hand its still kind of funny to know where that waters been its a good thing were a close crew
1809112 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1809113 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1809114 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1809115 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1809116 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1809117 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year
1809118 i will purchase a new backpack from wal mart with all her school supplies but nothing else will be new at the beginning of the school year
1809119 we recognized pretty early on the economic environment had taken a bit of a shift
1809120 we looked at what people are experiencing pain at the pump pain when we go to the grocery store
1809121 we hope users in ific bank would enjoy our high quality services at a very competitive price he said
1809122 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
1809123 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilise i think theyll stabilise well before the housing market fixes itself
1809124 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market
1809125 dont you see it if you control the fire one day you will be a cook
1809126 i always felt great around food around aromas one of the best things to me is when i am having a day off and i am cooking for friends or family and sometimes cooking like crazy and going to the market and all day cooking and at the end of the day i will complain why am i cooking again for everyone so that is why i know that cooking is something that this is too much in my body and in my dna that i cannot get away from it
1809127 i was very young in love with anything that sounded american
1809128 perfection cannot be something that can be achieved by profits it is something that can only be achieved by devotion and giving your best and sometimes it is spending more money than what you are able to charge for

1809135 de la gravedad y de los presupuestos pues hay asuntos m s contundentes y alarmantes que proteger en el estado
1809136 tendr a que pasar por un tr mite que alentar an los proyectos que se tienen respecto a los homenajes para honrar la memoria de emilio carballido para no crear m s confusi n se opt por dejar la sala grande como emilio carballido y posteriormente se estudiar la posibilidad de tambi n darle un nombre a la galer a y tambi n tal vez a la sala chica del teatro honrando a veracruzanos ilustres o artistas importantes que hayan
1809137 en la sala chica casi todo se hace a trav s de difusi n cultural a trav s de manuel zepeda y claudia vandala ellos tienen una agenda donde se canalizan todas las personas que vienen de la universidad
1809138 si tienen ellos ese problema nosotros lo que hacemos es tratar de que los t cnicos operen de tal forma que se pueden llevar a cabo los dos eventos hay veces que no se puede es muy rara la vez en que esto ha llegado a suceder
1809139 ha mejorado el teatro much simo est m s limpio el servicio al p blico es mucho mejor la atenci n es personalizada si algo nos falla en la medida de lo posible se trata de reparar pero hay cosas que requieren de una gran inversi n que llevan mucho tiempo por ejemplo una impermeabilizaci n es una cuesti n que se debe ver con obras p blicas se tiene que aprobar un presupuesto tengo un promedio de 275 oficios de cuando inicie labores a la fecha solicitando que resuelvan varios problemas se ha dado ayuda hay segmentos que ten an m s urgencia y ahora le viene el turno a la sala chica en los pr ximos d as y previo al homenaje de emilio carballido quedar reparada la filtraci n de agua de la sala chica hay muchos problemas porque el uso es constante la cuesti n es ponernos de acuerdo por eso se ha hecho poco a poco por segmentos y dependiendo de la gravedad y de los presupuestos pues hay asuntos m s contundentes y alarmantes que proteger en el estado

1809200 the anglican position on x is the christian position on x i do not mean to be arrogant or obscurantist i mean to say that when someone says whats the anglican position i say well what does the bible say what does jesus command what do the prophets and the apostles say if we can together with all the saints both now and throughout history submit to the bibles teaching then we have ourselves an anglican position christianitys dangerous idea
1809201 oh you know barack and michelle obama exchange terrorist fist taps and obama is really a muslim

1809203 the arminian holds that christ when he died did not die with an intent to save any particular person and they teach that christs death does not secure beyond doubt the salvation of any one man living they believe that christ died to make the salvation of all men possible or that by the doing of something else any man who pleases may attain unto eternal life consequently they are obliged to hold that if mans will would not give way and voluntarily surrender to grace then christs atonement would be unavailing they hold that there was no particularity and speciality in the death of christ christ died according to them as much for judas in hell as for peter who mounted to heaven they believe that for those who are consigned to eternal fire there was as true and real a redemption made as for those who now stand before the throne of the most high
1809204 i would rather believe a limited atonement that is efficacious for all men for whom it was intended than a universal atonement that is not efficacioius for anybody except the will of men be added to it

1809234 all the changes in his life he tells me are enough evidence for him the great sadness is gone and he experiences most days with a profound sense of joy

1809251 he jesus chose the way of the cross where mercy triumphs over justice because of love

1809278 in purely statistical terms do the articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
1809279 at times over the last month ive doubted that the bulletin actually exists a tiny newspaper from the houston suburbs filled week after week with bowdlerized joe conason columns and record reviews airlifted from the pages of slate it seemed preposterous and the longer i spent squinting into the of the bulletin s web 0 0 quality internet site the more i began to suspect that i was the dupe of a conceptual art prank a cheeky borgesian commentary on the slipperiness of language and authorship or something

1809284 if the price of oil keeps falling then will drop below the ex energy rate and the ex energy rate will itself drop thanks to cheaper transportation and petrochemicals
1809285 gives us a fair picture of what has happened to the cost of living over the past month or year but its near useless for telling us where inflation is headed in the future
1809286 but it dropped to 2 9 percent within five months as oil fell 35 3 percent
1809287 the cpi ex energy offers statistically significant explanatory power for future headline inflation
1809288 the ex energy measure generally maintained its better forecasting record for inflation over the longer sample period

1809297 parallel public financing system where the american people decide if they want to support a campaign they can get on the internet and finance it
1809298 almost half of small online donors contacted the campaign first
1809299 small donors look more like middle class americans in terms of their education and household income although donors are still higher in both respects
1809300 more congregated at both the young end ages 18 to 34 and the old end over 65 of the scale
1809301 young donors are seven times more likely to give over the internet

1809316 nevertheless the additional 74 million paid by state farm pursuant to the mississippi department of insurance reevaluation program apparently meets the minimum payments required under our original state court settlement agreement
1809317 perplexing that he hood would take full credit for a program he opposed and was the foundation for the lawsuit he filed against us and has now just settled however we are pleased the attorney general understands state farm has met its obligations under the agreement his office made
1809318 i dont recommend that parents ever use home drug tests
1809319 if we had sought professional help earlier i think we would have had a better chance of preventing this outcome
1809320 my clinical experience tells me that parents are fooled all the time
1809321 we do it under controlled circumstances and we know the tricks of the trade
1809322 players dont know what cards they will be dealt or what cards will be dealt to the board while techniques for dealing with chance have been well established in the context of other games such as backgammon what sets poker apart is that it is a game of imperfect information
1809323 six years ago a child could beat the best programs built now professional poker players would be hard pressed to defeat inot
1809324 my hope is that people will find these programs useful in improving their poker skills and their understanding of game theory

1809328 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1809329 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1809330 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1809331 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1809332 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1809333 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it

1809335 thats what happens when you make badly advised deals right at the peak of a recession
1809336 we expect to limit the effects from high raw material costs on our business through price increases and further counteractive measures
1809337 this is a different kind of beast that has at least 15 0 of industrial business price increases wont do the trick for the firm as consumers are not ready to pay a higher price for weak brands
1809338 our subscribers will be benefited from the deal as they do not need to physically visit any branch of the bank and stand in long queues to get basic banking information
1809339 it will improve our customer service significantly and make our banking services more convenient and easy for our customers
1809340 initial reports came through from a member of the wedding party itself indicating a number of people being ill
1809341 noroviruses spread primarily through consumption of food or water contaminated by fecal matter or through close contact with infected people
1809342 however in some people especially infants older adults and people with underlying disease vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention
1809343 i think we conducted 74 interviews monday evening its much easier when youre given a list of people who were there
1809344 if youre feeling ill and if youve had diarrhea we really ask people to refrain from cooking and helping with any food preparation activities for three days after the illness has subsided
1809345 were very proud of what we did because we really did accomplish a lot and figure out what was going on in a very short fashion

1809351 they want to know what their government is going to do to solve these problems
1809352 last week there was a chance to do something about the oil speculators who have played the situation and made it worse but mitch mcconnell said no
1809353 what a fraud mitch mcconnell is when it comes to the ruinous gasoline price hikes that have hit consumers across kentucky and america
1809354 even tried to blame his 2008 democratic opponent bruce lunsford for the gasoline price hike which of course is a national phenomenon
1809355 this is what you get when you pair someone like president bush whose failed economic policies and misplaced priorities took a surplus and turned it into the largest deficit in history and a senator like elizabeth dole who votes with bush 92 of the time against sensible budgeting decisions and priorities that put special interests before working families
1809356 the condition of a subway station sets the tone for users and impacts the perception and vitality of the area it serves new york has a vested interest in having clean well preserved stations but its current fiscal commitment does not reflect this

1809389 it may be hard to believe but from what weve now heard from multiple sources its true the fourth generation ipod nano will look like
1809390 many participants have told us that the 13 digit account number is too difficult to remember and makes logging into their accounts difficult
1809391 i believe being given the opportunity to replace the 13 digit tsp account number is definitely a step in the right direction
1809392 there may be people who can remember each and every one of their passwords and id numbers but im betting there arent a whole lot of them
1809393 this is the poisoned fruit of that poisonous if well intentioned policy of affirmative action

1809411 a solid 20 year energy strategy that incorporates every alternative energy option to reduce our dependence on oil

1809416 lance loved people he was a one man band he could sing and play we wanted to do something special in his memory because he was so giving to others
1809417 weve learned to work in the toledo environment in that if you understand the dynamics the personnel are very much available here you just need to know where to look
1809418 so we basically picked an industry at the top of its game right now
1809419 theyre always shocked to hear where were located but they say thats the internet for you you can do anything anywhere if you just set it up right
1809420 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay

1809426 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1809427 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1809428 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1809429 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1809430 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1809431 beijing as the host city will of course make full preparations for biological attacks like anthrax we have even made antibiotics and vaccines

1809434 you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
1809435 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
1809436 i walked through a metal detector to see last temptation of christ
1809437 i dont have a problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
1809438 offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

1809440 writing the unwritten life of the islamic eve menstruation and the demonization of motherhood
1809441 they dont want findings it makes waves and draws attention so they avoid those types of things so the higher ups dont come down on them
1809442 the goal is not to save taxpayers money people are really too afraid about what they will have to do to back up their findings so they try to avoid them altogether
1809443 and is taking every step necessary to review and address the issues cited in the report dcaa is committed to supporting any review of its procedures and is prepared to take immediate action to fix any problems found
1809444 in my opinion the end result was a massive bloated soulless bureaucracy that totally lost touch with the taxpayer
1809445 in the end defense contractors big and small are getting away with murder because they know we at dcaa are slaves to the metrics
1809446 theres got to be a balance somewhere but i think in dcaa headquarters strive to become a lean mean audit machine they swung the pendulum too far to the right
1809447 and by doing that they kind of shot themselves in the foot
1809448 not to make waves with these people and to do what i was asked
1809449 i was told that i could call the 800 hot line if i wanted
1809450 however i was reminded that gs 13 positions were coming open and that if i wanted to be promoted i should not report the fraud outside the agency i did not call the hot line
1809451 my understanding was that when contractors complain about any particular auditor bad things happen to that auditor
1809452 when i was there i always had to keep in mind how i interacted with the contractor because if the contractor complained about me it would definitely get back to my supervisor and there would be some sort of personnel actions or retaliation
1809453 they would say give them an opportunity to support the findings give them another chance to support it
1809454 it was a repetitive dont you think its getting better type pressure you almost get to the point where you feel you are not going to get anywhere this agency is broken
1809455 she wanted to try for a baby after the spice girls finished touring but shes put her plans on hold while she sees what can be done to help her she knows she is putting her health at risk if she dismisses the advice of her doctors and has another c section
1809456 countrywide conned customers into loans that were clearly unaffordable and unsustainable turning the american dream of homeownership into a nightmare
1809457 our research should encourage people to ask for help and not assume that others are disinclined to comply
1809458 people are more willing to help than you think and that can be important to know when youre trying to get the resources you need to get a job done when youre trying to solicit funds or what have you
1809459 a colleague had just finished reading a draft and was running late to a dinner appointment
1809460 he was in the subway and realized he should call ahead but didnt have a cell phone he told us that our paper gave him courage to ask a stranger to borrow his and that he was delighted when the person quickly obliged
1809461 participants were initially horrified at the prospect of going out and asking people for such things
1809462 but theyd bound back in to the lab afterward with big smiles saying i cant believe how nice people were
1809463 people seem to miscalculate how willing others are to say yes to direct requests even in a conservative case like this where theyre open to soliciting others and the request is significant anywhere from 30 to more than 1 000
1809464 peoples underestimation of others willingness to comply is driven by their failure to diagnose these feelings of social obligation on the part of others
1809465 that really puts the obligation on them and makes it very awkward for them to refuse
1809466 the lesson is that you should pay more attention to how your request is being made than to the size of your request
1809467 other studies weve conducted indicate that people overestimate how likely it is that others will come to them for help
1809468 this means not only are people not asking for help when in fact they could get it but theyre not encouraging others to come to them for help when in fact theyre willing to offer it that tells us that the open door policy is basically ineffective unless people are actively encouraged to use it
1809469 our work suggests that greenhouse gas emissions which have come mostly from the wealthy developed countries already constitute an example of dangerous climate change
1809470 the models agree that anthropogenic warming has occurred over the past 50 years and will occur over the next 50 years
1809471 we show that this warming has caused and likely will cause main growing season drought in the worlds most food insecure countries
1809472 many of the farming techniques used now are inadequate and there has been very little support for agricultural development
1809473 theres very little use of fertilizer or farm machinery that means theres a strong potential to increase farm production modest improvements in per capita agricultural capacity could substantially alleviate undernourishment making africa agriculturally self supporting in 30 years even with declining rainfall africa can be self sufficient
1809474 o twitter um ambiente t o seguro quanto qualquer outro na web a diferen a est no comportamento das pessoas houve uma poca em que espalhar c digos maliciosos era feito principalmente por e mail mas os usu rios comuns j aprenderam que n o podem confiar em links enviados por e mails desconhecidos agora precisam fazer o mesmo com as redes sociais

1809484 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for man united
1809485 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1809486 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1809487 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1809488 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1809489 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1809490 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1809491 the chinese said they werent required to give a reason
1809492 to me this fits in with the olympics which are about the world coming together for the betterment of mankind
1809493 funny how the compsci ca dont even show up in
1809494 someone with too much time on their hands thinks up some question typically personal and starts a post
1809495 since djamel has been at guantanamo bay his whole family has been living a nightmare our mother who hasnt seen him in 18 years is very sick and hopes to see him before she dies that hope is the one thing that has kept her alive since our father died in april 2007 our father also hoped to hold djamel in his arms before he left us but he didnt have the chance and he departed with this dream unfulfilled as for djamel he was devastated when he learned the sad news that the father who loved him so much passed away the whole family anxiously awaits djamels return to us
1809496 while the supreme courts decision in boumediene restores mr amezianes right to habeas the fact remains that he is still sitting in his cell in guant namo without charge deprived of any semblance of meaningful review of his detention for over six years and with no remedy under u s law for his torture and other violations there must be a public accounting for all that mr ameziane has suffered at the hands of the u s government appealing to this international body is a way to push for such an accounting
1809497 guant namo bay has become a global symbol of impunity and inhumanity now an international body will have the opportunity to demand that the united states hold accountable those responsible for mr amezianes torture and abuse
1809498 i had the impression that my head was sinking in water simply thinking of it gives me the chills
1809499 perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years
1809500 debate moderators abuse the public trust every time they ask trivial questions about gaffes and gotchas that only political insiders care about enough with the distractions abc and other networks must focus on issues that affect peoples daily lives
1809501 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1809502 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1809503 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1809504 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1809505 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1809506 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
1809507 define irony a search engine cant find any results for the word failure
1809508 why even try to break into the search engine business
1809509 with recent results its going to be a tall order for them to raise any significant amount of capital without government help
1809510 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1809511 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1809512 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1809513 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1809514 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1809515 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
1809516 the 28 million licensed drivers in california and washington have had plenty of time to prepare for the law since the measure was adopted by the legislature back in 2006 and i think that government agencies and manufacturers of hands free products have done a really great job of creating awareness among consumers
1809517 the july 1 deadline to go hands free in california had a substantial effect on parrot branded products
1809518 we experienced over 180 unit sales growth in the 2nd quarter of 2008 as compared to the 1st quarter having trained sales staff in place was extremely important as consumers struggled to understand bluetooth and what their options were beyond headsets

1809521 i would be making less money than some of the people i was supervising with more responsibility
1809522 one of the fallbacks is the lack of communication and teamwork between various sections and the patrol officers
1809523 to talk about whats going on there are mutual conversations going back and forth across those lines
1809524 if supplies are not available i dont know why officers are not getting them
1809525 being a good police officer in detroit was about working and then making good cases to better serve the community
1809526 the message i have received here in atlanta is that we are here to boost statistics for the purpose of satisfying the power structure
1809527 can be used as an evaluation tool to measure our effectiveness in reducing crime
1809528 the officers here go out and love their job if you feel appreciated you do a much better job

1809649 a lot of this has to do with what the candidates are asked to speak to
1809650 commanded the highest level of attention from j k and his office
1809651 if upstream emissions from heat and electricity are included emissions from buildings total 40 of global emissions and up to 80 of total greenhouse gas emissions in our cities and towns the building sector provides more potential for quick deep and cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation than any other industry
1809652 an integrated eets will improve the energy efficiency of the vast majority 98 of building stock existing buildings which hold the lowest cost abatement opportunities in the world
1809653 high value carbon credits of aud 34 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2 e could realistically achieve a carbon zero position in commercial office buildings at nil cost and based on the mckinsey cost curves energy efficiency in buildings represents an estimated cost negative abatement of us 45 billion to the united states economy and 5 2 billion to the australian economy
1809654 a project only qualifies if it can prove that the emissions reduction would not have occurred without the project in its strictest sense this means that the project must not have been financially feasible without carbon credits
1809655 at the moment a number of projects regarding energy efficiency in buildings such as those that introduce solar power more efficient lighting devices hvac systems and cooking devices such as stoves in rural areas that require less biomass in their operation are eligible for the flexible instruments of the kyoto protocol particularly under the cdm these projects are however still rather few in number and limited to active solutions such as pv cells or other technological options passive solutions such as the design of better oriented and ventilated buildings are not yet applicable under the instruments of the kyoto protocol

1809663 the very first day james thrash was out there i knew that it didnt matter what we had with the young rookies he was going to play
1809664 he was ready he really took to how we were doing it he can play all three receiver positions he can play them at a high speed fashion real veteran stuff you know what i mean
1809665 and my hope is that the younger guys like malcolm and devin will actually hang around and rub up right against him and all that stuff will just ooze off onto them
1809666 i remember not too long ago i had jersey no 41 on as a receiver trying to make the team i never would have thought i would play this long
1809667 i wish i could have him on the field every snap
1809668 hes going to catch a lot of balls this year
1809669 if you cant pass that physical test that we give you somethings not right
1809670 but once they get out there and they really see what they have to do and how exact they have to be and the speed at which they have to play and the intensity theyll see can we get them in and work them in yes will they get up to speed yes but this is valuable time that theyre missing
1809671 as far as making an impact from the get go
1809672 i dont think that is going to be a difficult thing to do
1809673 i dont think that is a fair thing to say
1809674 we came in prepared enough to do what we could do we had a lot of other distractions going on as far as becoming a rookie but as far as being in shape we were in shape it was just a tough deal that we both got hurt

1809679 will now include the finding that the laptop has been found and that no one attempted to access that information let alone obtained it
1809680 the truth is that whenever you create two paths through security a high security path and a low security path you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low security path it may be counterintuitive but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error filled database or a cursory background check
1809681 la meditaci n no es ninguna t cnica extra a que tengamos que aprender con gran dificultad y esfuerzo la meditaci n ya forma parte considerable de nuestras vidas pero simplemente no nos damos cuenta de ello cuando leemos o estudiamos o cuando investigamos tenemos que enfocar la mente cuando conducimos un coche o cuando manejamos maquinaria tenemos que prestar atenci n cuando le explicamos algo a un amigo tenemos que concentrarnos para hacernos entender y nuestro amigo tiene que concentrarse para entendernos los amantes meditan el uno en el otro una madre medita en su hijo cualquier cosa que logremos en este mundo lo conseguimos por el poder de la concentraci n que no es otra cosa que la meditaci n hasta ahora nuestra concentraci n se ha enfocado en cosas mundanas pero sencillamente cambiamos la direcci n de nuestra meditaci n si simplemente nos volvemos hacia dentro estamos meditando en el ser al igual que cuando la mente se enfoca hacia el exterior percibe el mundo exterior cuando mira hacia dentro ve el mundo interior es as de sencillo

1809707 this is an important finding since there are effective medications to reduce gastric acid that can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding
1809708 more research will be needed to determine whether this is a viable strategy to improve outcomes after stroke in high risk patients
1809709 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
1809710 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
1809711 this is the first report of racial and ethnic differences in fgf 23 levels and we are now investigating whether such differences are also seen in healthy patients and those with earlier stages of kidney disease
1809712 we expect those differences may relate to previous observations of calcium phosphorous and vitamin d metabolism differences among racial groups we also need to investigate whether fgf 23 elevations are toxic in themselves or if they are simply a biomarker for abnormal phosphate balance
1809713 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage kidney disease who do not yet require dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
1809714 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group
1809715 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence
1809716 as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
1809717 its important for people to understand that this ambulatory form of treatment exists is successful and can be widely implemented in resource poor settings
1809718 dr tb is everywhere in the world its been looked for and its not going away without additional resources
1809719 but no one really knows how many have xdr tb
1809720 if the cycle is paused because the cell is having some problem
1809721 it cant stop and go back so it either kills the new cell or repairs the problem
1809722 if either the replicating enzymes run into damage or if there are insufficient precursors for making dna then this checkpoint response will be activated
1809723 there are two aspects to this response one is to prevent the cycle from proceeding and the other is to prepare the cell to deal with the damage

1809756 i was a philosophical kid who was looking to find happiness and inner peace through various teachings and philosophies and i got swept up into the world of fashion and there were some lessons to be learned there
1809757 it was a struggle because your life is filled with mistakes and errors and a lot of regrets
1809758 teenagers from the future essays on the legion of super heroes
1809759 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
1809760 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
1809761 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
1809762 the first thing i want to know about it is what the foundations can tell us about the architecture
1809763 how big was it how does it compare with the rose how does it compare with the globe how similar are they
1809764 the size of the theater will have an impact on the way the play is written
1809765 this is a good sign for the possible replacement of the other three genes used to reprogram cells
1809766 ips cells hold great potential for future medicine but we must learn how to generate these cells in a manner that is safe for clinical therapies
1809767 this advance in reprogramming is one key step toward that goal
1809768 were not sure if the wnt molecule is doing the same thing as c myc or complementing activity
1809769 but it does increase stem cell growth similar to c myc
1809770 this is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
1809771 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
1809772 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells
1809773 we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate
1809774 whether it is the biennial international aids conferences or one of the countless domestic hiv aids conferences taxpayers have been spending millions every year to send federal employees to talk about a disease when instead using the same funds for prevention treatment or research would almost certainly have been a better use of taxpayer resources
1809775 agencies have procedures and guidance on conferences and conference travel to minimize costs and make sure their employees participation is based on mission needs
1809776 to this end we continually strive to ensure we use our resources in the most efficient and targeted way
1809777 this includes evaluating that an appropriate amount of people are at scientific gatherings we do recognize our experts can benefit from the knowledge of others and share what they learn by attending conferences but we must strike the right balance when approving expensive international travel
1809778 as more and more content is being uploaded to the internet people are putting themselves in the drivers seat instead of waiting for web sites to serve up the content
1809779 for the first time in american history viewers of the debates will be empowered to watch the event in real time online and review candidate responses on demand
1809780 from the candidate profiles on myspace to the viral fundraising by our community we are committed to creating an environment that creates higher levels of civic engagement
1809781 exit polls have consistently found that the general election debates are the number one factor in shaping voter choice
1809782 mydebates org will enable americans to make the most of information presented during the debates and even personalize their experience by homing in on the issues that are most important to them
1809783 so when the price of oil goes up fuel duty would actually be cut and with duty rising when oil prices fall we would be putting something aside in the good years to help in difficult times
1809784 had the fair fuel stabiliser been introduced in the 2008 budget when unleaded petrol cost 1 08 a litre then half of the 10p rise since then would have been absorbed by government
1809785 presuming a knowledge of future trends in oil prices which is not shared by most people who look at these professionally
1809786 there was an incident that happened and some of ours were involved
1809787 we have been unconvinced of the governments real commitment to implementing meaningful green taxation

1809789 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and that it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1809790 the fbi sought out the best experts in the scientific community and over time for highly sensitive and specific tests were developed that were capable of detecting the unique qualities of the anthrax used in the 2001 attacks
1809791 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1809792 one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement

1809807 how many of you plan to ask questions at the end of this

1809811 a portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate html based web page by the end user
1809812 matter of principle we just dont believe in this kind of discrimination
1809813 expressing an anti same sex marriage view if they knew that the teacher couldnt stand to stay at a hotel owned by somebody who opposed same sex marriage
1809814 that would certainly make a statement about gay marriage and would actually be within the jurisdiction so to speak of the aals which is all about law professors not hoteliers
1809815 does this now mean that a member of the legal writing institute or these aals sections who is opposed to same sex marriage is no longer a member in good standing
1809816 this man seeks the highest elective office in the world not primarily as a politician but as a celebrity hes the only politician a woman would read about while sitting
1809817 the democrats are going to nominate a man who no matter how serious his political dedication might be is indisputably and willy nilly going to be seen as a great box office actor
1809818 he is a pleasant man who without any important qualifications for the office would very much like to be president
1809819 americas politics would now be also americas favorite movie americas first soap opera americas best seller
1809820 one would have an inkling at last if the desire of america was for drama or stability for adventure or monotony
