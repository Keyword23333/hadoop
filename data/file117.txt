1170000 i dont really know what the numbers are telling me about my risk
1170001 i dont want to tear it out but i dont want cancer either
1170002 there is no known safe level of radon or radiation
1170003 it makes sense if you can choose another counter that doesnt elevate your risk however slightly why wouldnt you
1170004 we want to reassure the public that their granite countertops are safe
1170005 we know the vast majority of granites are safe but there are some new exotic varieties coming in now that weve never seen before and we need to use sound science to evaluate them
1170006 i think it will be like the mold litigation a few years back where some cases were legitimate and a whole lot were not

1170013 ernest wilford is having trouble big time trouble getting open
1170014 henne to wilford on a nice 18 yard square in route wilford and hagan have looked real crisp during camp
1170015 still here and your not right yet and becks hands arent small
1170016 your constanly pointing out everytime your right on about anything
1170017 beck starts off 1 for 5 and finishes 4 for 10 he has some nice throws but also throws an interception to renaldo hill not sure if that was a nice play by hill bad route running by reagan mauia or a bad throw from beck
1170018 beck finishes with a really nice throw to ryan on a flag route in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown
1170019 and another short completion to derek hagan this was actually a nice one looks like beck made a hot read sent hagan over the middle to the empty spot got him the ball quickly and hagan turned it up field for a nice gain
1170020 becks up again this time from the 14 slant pass to ginn touchdown
1170021 that being said may the best man win at qb and if somehow it ends up being quincy carter im going to throw up
1170022 there is no patience in this town and there needs to be now

1170026 by partnering with atlantis we are able to offer programming to new audiences including musicians and producers outside the urban and electronic talent base with atlantis we feel we have created a true must attend event
1170027 i dont know but i can tell you what the secret of failure is trying to please everyone

1170031 members of the society of professional journalists believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy the duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues conscientious journalists from all media and specialties strive to serve the public with thoroughness and honesty
1170032 bottom line big news revolves around sex conflict unusualness and tragedy all of which are part of the dramatic imperative
1170033 providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues
1170034 providing a fair and comprehensive account of those events and issues deemed particularly dramatic
1170035 heres a thorough and honest report of todays important events
1170036 heres a report of the most dramatic of todays events that we were able to produce without the cost cutting too much into our bottom line
1170037 we want to blitz pick and rolls and show hard we dont want to be on our heels at all we want to be a team that plays on our toes
1170038 id like people to say someday that you dont like going into memphis because those guys play dirty they play tough and theyre rough
1170039 it seems like he picks up on every mistake you make he wants to make everybody better hes yelling and picking up the intensity everybodys learning a lot from him
1170040 were going to entrust kevins system with our players and buy into that i feel very confident about that
1170041 at the same time were going to insist that we dont give up our attack mentality on offense thats going to be the challenge this year
1170042 but we needed to reassess with better players and better schemes kevins going to be more of me than i could possibly be thats what i like about it i dont have to be that sergeant at arms it allows me to hand something off and still keep the big picture
1170043 my game starts with defense the game is more fun when you start diving around and hustling
1170044 we have a lot of guys who can score but its good to know were going to bring intensity on that end of the court
1170045 we want to be a team that plays in a group
1170046 a lot of times people talk about whether guys are selfish on offense the same thing is true on defense if you dont go and help your teammate and do the right thing on every possession then you hurt your overall team defense
1170047 individual defense is a big part of man to man defense but we want to adopt the philosophy that youve got one guy guarding the ball and four guys helping to guard the ball at all times
1170048 we want to make people shoot over the top of us
1170049 and then be a great defensive rebounding team weve got a group of young guys capable of doing those things as long as we have a work mentality on the defensive end weve got a chance thats what we want to give ourselves every night out
1170050 we can be instinctive and concentrate more on one on one defense now
1170051 were forcing people baseline which a lot of the guys are used to coming out of college and high school its a lot easier for people to get used to that than forcing people to the middle
1170052 everybody is trying to keep up the intensity on defense
1170053 we know that were a very athletic team and if we play hard on that end then itll make our offense a lot easier
1170054 were starting to pick up opponents a lot full court
1170055 were learning how to turn our man a couple of times were trying to take people out of their sets and aggravate them
1170056 everybody understands that if you devote a lot of energy in one area then somethings got to give a little bit we dont want it to give a lot we dont want to give up a quick inbound after an occasional make

1170063 religious faith was once the air everyone even the doubter breathed today religious faith in its many forms stands as but one possibility alongside a range of nonreligious outlooks that the honest believer cannot simply dismiss as deluded or depraved
1170064 religious thinkers of course have long argued that uncertainty and faith are not the polar opposites often supposed that indifference and not doubt for example is the greater adversary of faith that absolute certitude about god often reflects a dangerous arrogance
1170065 examine the wondrous behaviour of the prophets and recall the defamations and denials uttered by the children of negation and falsehood perchance you may cause the bird of the human heart to wing its flight away from the abodes of heedlessness and doubt unto the nest of faith and certainty and drink deep from the pure waters of ancient wisdom and partake of the fruit of the tree of divine knowledge such is the share of the pure in heart of the bread that hath descended from the realms of eternity and holiness

1170094 it is no accident that capitalism has brought with it progress not merely in production but also in knowledge egoism and competition are alas stronger forces than public spirit and sense of duty in russia they say it is impossible to get a decent piece of bread bureaucracy is the death of all sound work i have seen and experienced too many dreadful warnings even in comparatively model switzerland the state can only be of real use to industry as a limiting and regulating force

1170097 a knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty which our minds seem to reach only in their most elementary forms it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude in this sense and in this alone i am a deeply religious man

1170190 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
1170191 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port
1170192 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1170193 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
1170194 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat

1170243 instead of economic life being submerged in social relations these relations become an epiphenomenon of the market
1170244 standard economic analysis neglects the identity and past relations of individual transactors but rational individuals know better relying on their knowledge of these relations
1170245 disorder arises because conflict free social and economic transactions depend on trust and the absence of malfeasance

1170250 i think thats unfair to blame it just on the linebackers its a team game some plays are our fault some are the some are the secondarys as a whole we gave up too many big plays as far as running the ball
1170251 its the same scheme that we had last year but were approaching it a lot different were getting a new attitude as gunther cunningham would call it you can ask the offense were definitely coming downhill hitting whoevers carrying the ball
1170252 yeah definitely gunther is the type of coach who is going to put the best three on the field hes going to let you know that youre going to play the way he wants you to play
1170253 its about even we all get our fair share mostly in the meetings gun is very passionate about his work and hes going to get it done one way or another
1170254 i think were doing good were very aggressive already were going to be better than last year especially along the line thats what weve been putting emphasis on stopping the run once we do that we give the offense a chance to do a lot of things
1170255 i didnt know how we were going to do it at first but its going quite well you actually get into his mindset on how you play linebacker i never knew that in three years that ive been here i knew he was a hard coach and was going to get his work done but at the same time i didnt know how much he knew about linebackers he knows a lot my game is going to go to another level i cant wait
1170256 he always says the best three are going to play it may be three or four if youre messing up not playing the way he wants you to play hes going to get you out of there
1170257 were getting an identity and going out with a purpose every day to create that attitude that we need this defense is going to be really good this year i cant wait i really cant speak too much on it until about the second or third preseason game when we really gel together but what were doing now and with what were trying to do its going to be really good
1170258 im definitely ready im definitely capable of doing that with gunther as my coach its definitely going to help me get where i need to be going its more about being consistent and i think i you know i dont need a magic wand or anything to help me play on the field but as far as being consistent if i can do that the skys the limit
1170259 i think we still have the same scheme we still have gun in the room so were going to play his defense but you know weve had different coaches in the past especially me ive had three linebacker coaches its been a little change but change is part of the nfl youve just got to adjust and go with it
1170260 thats true thats a good thing thats positive pressure knowing that people especially my teammates know that im capable of being that star player for this team and being that leader on the field especially when we have adversity

1170450 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1170451 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1170452 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1170453 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1170454 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1170455 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1170456 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1170457 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

1170462 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1170463 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1170464 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1170465 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1170466 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
1170467 oh honey you just need to meet the right man

1170469 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

1170472 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

1170580 when i examined a photo of andrews from that night at miller park i wasnt offended maybe she wasnt dressed like katie couric at the network anchor desk but then anchoring the news isnt her job
1170581 seriously what is becoming of this profession when a girl cant wear a summer skirt to a baseball game without offending someone
1170582 erin heres a bit of a newsflash if you want to be perceived as a professional you dress professionally
1170583 youre not there as a piece of meat erin honestly i understand you can become close with the players but to start giving them cutsie nicknames and shrinking your clothes is not only disrespectful to yourself but to other female journalists and possibly the players so thanks erin andrews i really appreciate you making it even harder for females in the club house to be respected
1170584 when the talk of the day is not the game but how high a hemline is that is a problem i realize that part of our job as female reporters is to look good im not an idiot and i know our gender is part of the reason were employed with that said we should never become the story of the day
1170585 many have been leered at by athletes just as andrews was wednesday but these women have worked hard to overcome the stereotypes they never would pander to athletes they never would get touchy feely being considered professional is paramount to them i believe they would have been mortified to see that scene wednesday a reporter who lived the stereotype and profited from it
1170586 its erin andrews fault for wearing a sundress when its blazing hot outside since they just cant help themselves for fairness we wish someone would follow peter gammons around and take pictures of his rump in tight trousers and of him eating hot dogs suggestively and not because were into the jockey type but because it would be hilarious to watch a guy put under the same scrutiny
1170587 erin is a tremendous reporter shes a prepared and a hard working journalist who is well respected and asks excellent questions were proud to have her as an important part of our coverage team beyond that we feel its unnecessary to even respond to any of the specifics outlined
1170588 did she really feel playing the sexpot was necessary to practice journalism
1170589 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on

1170601 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
1170602 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
1170603 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
1170604 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
1170605 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
1170606 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1170607 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1170608 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1170609 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1170610 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1170611 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1170612 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1170613 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1170614 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1170615 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1170616 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1170617 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

1170623 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1170624 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1170625 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

1170628 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping

1170632 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1170633 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

1170739 i want to start out by congratulating andre tippett on his remarkable induction this past weekend
1170740 if you stop and think about what a remarkable feat it is to get selected to any hall of fame certainly the nfl hall of fame all you have to do is look at the people who are in that group and maybe more telling look at the players who havent been selected its a fantastic achievement hes just a tremendous representative of our university and certainly for the sport of football
1170741 when we put on the iowa uniform we want to represent andre tippett matt roth and all the nfl players who have continued their legacy to the nfl theyre perfect examples of what a hawkeye is and what he does on and off the field were definitely proud of him and we give him much respect
1170742 its a great honor for him to get inducted into the hall of fame
1170743 hopefully one day ballard and i can follow in his footsteps you can dream about being in the hall of fame but now im just focused on being the best i can be in college
1170744 were 60 percent left handed and the head coach is left handed
1170745 so we might be right on a train wreck path here that would be a good thing to write about you guys are always looking for those little colorful things
1170746 the only time i really felt pressure was when i interviewed at cleveland from maine
1170747 my wife said if i didnt get the job she was going with the guy that did so i felt a little bit of pressure there
1170748 since i recruit florida we decided to check out the left coast for our honeymoon coach carl jackson gave us tips on where we needed to go since he spent all that time out there with the san francisco 49ers our off season is pretty short and to be honest with you you dont like to be away too long this is home for me now iowa is home for all of us and its just a great place to be you cant beat it
1170749 the past is the past whether weve done something good or something bad
1170750 you move on thats what you do in life thats what you do in sports this is a new season and a new year this group is really excited about whats in front of them
1170751 im replacing coach jackson on the staff but im never going to replace coach jackson coach jackson is a tremendous coach and a tremendous man who has been a great mentor to me in my nine years here and obviously hes going to be missed yes im taking his spot on the staff but i dont ever intend to try to replace him
1170752 you start right in the middle of the defense and you have two guys who have played four years that are good players good guys hard workers and leaders
1170753 i dont know all the guys in the country i dont pretend to know all the guys in the country but id just as soon have our two
1170754 it took 29 minutes before we got the spread word out
1170755 cheese spread that would be wisconsin if they went to it the cheese spread offense i just thought of that
1170756 i am excited for this year we are going to have a better team than we did last year we are obviously much more experienced on the offensive side of the ball which is exciting we are getting tony moeaki back which is huge for our offense in addition our receivers last year got a lot of good experience that will make things a lot more competitive during camp and will make us better as a team
1170757 we have really high goals we want to win the big ten and we feel like we can every year we have the talent to do it it is just a matter of staying healthy and working hard
1170758 it has definitely gone by fast and i will be sad when it is all over that being said it is just motivation to have a good year and go out with a bang i have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to come here and i am just looking forward to having a great senior year
1170759 my focus is just getting better every day i have no doubts in my ability it will be healthy competition but in my eyes i am the guy
1170760 obviously it has been pretty well documented that i didnt play as well as i should have last year it was a learning experience it made me that much better and i think it is going to make this entire team that much better a lot of the guys were disappointed from last year but we dont get down on ourselves we just have to improve
1170761 improving our team cohesiveness will help a lot once you start playing with guys and start knowing what they like and what they dont like you become more comfortable that is a big part of it just like confidence and experience that is right up there
1170762 the media tends to go after the quarterback hes a great quarterback thats why he was our starter last year in time i think you will see improvement everyone on the offensive side of the ball hes a tough guy no question and you have to be tough to be a quarterback in the big ten
1170763 i feel good i had the surgery in december and missed spring ball but i was working hard with coach chris doyle on my running and lifting my left arm feels real good
1170764 i think we can do pretty well for ourselves if we come to practice and go after it hard each day with the right mentality to get better we can be pretty good hopefully we can start off with a good camp to get us going in that right direction
1170765 we are a pretty young team all around and its great to have their energy and enthusiasm out here its a great way to start the year off everybody is working hard to get better every day
1170766 weve come a lot closer this past year as a team theres not one thing you can put your finger on but you can just tell there are a lot of guys interacting with each other its a lot different than past years
1170767 i dont think its squarely on my shoulders it is on everybody to lead weve got a lot of young kids and we need those guys to step up and lead by example too i dont feel any excess pressure but theres just as much pressure on us seniors as there is for a freshman
1170768 definitely you look at a game like that and you have a chance to win your last game at home the senior game and go to a bowl theres no reason you cant pull something out of as far as you havent arrived the hays not in the barn kind of thing
1170769 its more of a vocal role really im more in a position if i see a guy not doing what they need to be doing im in a position to kind of say something out of the fact that i played last year and ive been out there just naturally you receive more attention when you talk when you say something guys listen
1170770 definitely its huge having on field experience you can only watch so much film and you cant really duplicate experience in practice or in the film room once you get on the field its a different game and you just have to get used to it
1170771 what surprised me the most was game day really the speed of the game players are at the top level playing also getting used to the stadiums i mean we play here at kinnick a lot but going on the road to penn state purdue getting used to those stadiums and those atmospheres
1170772 hes brought excitement knowledge hes brought a different way to look at things and hes a fun person to be around hes is very knowledgeable and experienced just a great person to learn from looking at all of the guys that he has coached he definitely has a nice resume its nice to learn from the best
1170773 he campbell has us do a couple different things to think about for example the different ways of running your routes and keeping stuff vertical so everything you do is threatening your deep route no defensive back wants to be beat deep so if you make a re route look that way theyre not going to know what youre doing and theyre always going to be guessing
1170774 its been a nice transition because hes made it smooth for us and its all under coach ferentz so its not like we have a new offensive philosophy or anything its just hearing a new voice and the new voice has excitement he runs around the field a lot and keeps us going
1170775 last year was definitely hard on the receiving and tight end positions but we got everybody back healthy and we have a lot of depth this year so its going to be nice to know that if anybody goes down we have somebody that has already had in game experience to back us up
1170776 i expected to play i started the first game and probably should have started all the rest of the games but i was hurt and i was only practicing 20 percent of the practices last year andy brodell got hurt and he didnt get to come back and i got hurt and i fortunately got to come back so i was happy at least that i got to play as much as i did i always expect to play thats why you come here
1170777 i definitely think that the offseason has helped me improve its a great opportunity to get more time to work on things and last year during the beginning of the year i was inconsistent i was young and it was a big atmosphere it was very exciting it was a learning experience in the beginning of the season and towards the end of the season i started to pick it up a lot and i worked more on my form and blocked everything else out and when i blocked everything else out good things started to happen
1170778 all the necessary resources that i need i have here at iowa i talk to jason baker and the coaches they all help me with my form and anything i need any tips i need i can get there is no one else better to learn from then jason baker hes one of the highest paid nfl professionals and thats not for no reason hes definitely has some great tips
1170779 when you first start off during the day youre not working to get everything quick and everything in motion right away you just want to start off getting your form right getting your steps down and after that then you can work on timing because then you go with the team when your with the team thats when you concentrate on doing your form right as well as the speed really you want to try and do it naturally as fast as you can
1170780 i came in the summer before the season so that helped me out a lot they say some freshman dont really fit in but to me it really helped coming in the summer before two a days because when the season started i already knew how the workouts were so for me that really helped out a lot i got to talk to the players and get to know them in the summer and you get used to the workouts so all that really helps
1170781 attitude really is just to get better everyone comes out to practice to try and get better as a whole group we have a lot of depth as linebackers so we feed off each other like that so we really do just come out here to get better each day
1170782 i think the fourth quarter of the wisconsin game was really the eye opener for me when they put me in and i got two tackles in the backfield that really opened my eyes to what big ten football is since i havent played a whole season yet i cant really say what a whole season is like
1170783 we have some experience more than we did last year were just looking to build on to that and see improvement on our younger guys and older guys in general
1170784 it is a team game and when he coach okeefe says its everybodys deal it could be the line not protecting long enough qb not getting the look the receiver breaking the route but each play its one guy so if we can correct one guy we obviously need a bunch of corrections to drop the sacks but we can improve in that area this year
1170785 i know hes a heck of a player if you watch film from two years ago he split time with albert and damien and i dont think anyone argued about what kind of caliber player they were when it comes to special teams hes a ball hog always around making plays so anytime we can add a player like him to our team its going to be good for us
1170786 we started three years ago we just started our senior year here now weve kind of grown to our positions we obviously dont talk about it much but you still realize it its something you take in stride and you do your best you can to lead
1170787 we have two new d ends stepping in this year so im excited to see what they bring obviously theyre big guys i think theyre right around 285 so hopefully were not the small line anymore in the big ten well see what we can do this year and keep improving every day we come out they realize that they have to step up that they cant sit behind in that second spot they know what they have to do and they know that its going to be tough theyre going to take theyre hits at the beginning of the season but as long as they keep improving and keep going strong theyll be fine
1170788 you know just put my head down and just give it everything i got and well see what happens the other guys coming in have the same idea too and theyre definitely gunning for it so itll be really good competition

1170814 were the kind of team that can maybe beat anyone in the draw but on the other side we can probably lose to anyone in the draw too on a bad day
1170815 for me freddy and i have always played well in davis cup
1170816 obviously freddy nenad is at a different level than freddy is hes a dangerous player hes got a huge serve and hes very aggressive
1170817 hes not the kind of guy whos intimidated which is important
1170818 hes playing against guys who are some of the top 10 doubles players in the world every time he goes on the court so i think its good to have that attitude and thats one of the reasons i chose him
1170819 its a little different at the net hes not a natural doubles player so thats the little bit of the difference
1170820 we have to be aggressive when we play together move a lot keep our opponents off balance we cant just rely on playing straight up doubles
1170821 we have to have different formations keep our opponents guessing
1170822 hes not someone who plays doubles every week so theres little tips you can give
1170823 if you ask most of the doubles guys whos one of the worst guys to play against its definitely danny
1170824 danny is somebody that you can rely on and thats i think the reason why we are doing well really well at the most important times in the match

1170834 like most of the israelites of that time and geographical location the messiah would have been multi lingual and would have chosen his language scriptures according to the mother tongue of the person with whom he was interacting whats this obsession with knowing which languages the messiah spoke or which version of the scriptures he might have used what is important is that whatever language he spoke or whatever version of the scriptures he used he would always have communicated the truth

1170857 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1170947 when the abdullahs died abdullah bin abbas abdullah bin az zubayr and abdullah bin amr bin al as all the knowledge that was present in all the lands was left in the hands of their servants so the scholar of the people of makkah was ata bin abi rabah the scholar of yemen was tawus the scholar of yamamah was yahya bin abi kathir the scholar of kufah was ibrahim the scholar of basrah was al hasan the scholar of sham was makhul and the scholar of khurasan was ata al khurasani all except madinah as allah had reserved this position for a qurashi so the scholar of madinah was said bin al musayyab without dispute

1171016 the results highlight a significant hole in our healthcare system
1171017 they re confirm our fears that this issue is being swept under the carpet and not being talked about with professionals an open dialogue is essential to proper diagnosis and treatment
1171018 not all memory complaints mark alzheimers disease but if they do the earlier an individual knows the earlier he or she can be treated plan for the future and embrace social services support this is a window of opportunity to delay cognitive decline and thereby improve quality of life for individuals with the disease and their families
1171019 americans need to step up their efforts to optimize overall health including brain health the threat of alzheimers disease and co existing conditions is too great to ignore
1171020 the laboratory investigation suggests that administration of a perfluorocarbon with the characteristics and performance of oxycyte combined with 100 oxygen therapy can reverse tissue oxygen deficit and holds promise for reducing ischemic injury
1171021 traumatic spine injury is a major cause of long term disability for our troops in the war zones as well as 200 000 plus civilian injuries per year if we could develop a rapid technique to salvage as much function as possible immediately after injury this would be a major breakthrough in spine trauma the key to tissue salvage may well be immediate oxygen delivery to tissues at risk
1171022 weve always known what our compound is capable of now this latest research shows the possibility of yet another indication for treatment with oxycyte in addition to those weve previously discussed potentially broadening our product portfolio if this early research translates to humans oxycyte could have a significant impact on the lives of spinal cord injury victims

1171025 we know the hispanic community is in need of increased education on the benefits of diagnosing and treating ad early
1171026 this news should serve as a call to action for hispanic families to watch for early signs of ad among their loved ones and speak with a doctor as soon as possible if symptoms are suspected
1171027 all too often hispanics dismiss the symptoms of ad as signs of normal aging and wait years before consulting a doctor
1171028 this study reminds us of the value of treating ad to slow symptoms of the disease and i encourage primary care physicians with hispanic patients to start screening for signs of dementia at a younger age potentially at 55 or 60 years
1171029 to my knowledge no other approved or investigational treatment has stabilized function across all facets of alzheimers disease for this length of time
1171030 these data suggest that dimebon may provide long term benefits to alzheimers patients and provide further support for its potential as a promising therapeutic to treat this devastating disease
1171031 a nearly 10 point improvement over placebo in moderate patients on the adas cog a well validated cognition scale in alzheimers disease is unquestionably of clinical significance especially in light of a clinical effect seen on the clinicians assessment of global function
1171032 if the results we saw for both the mild and moderate patients can be replicated i believe that dimebon will be an important advance in the treatment of alzheimers disease regardless of stage
1171033 all of the approved alzheimers disease drugs operate by one of two mechanisms cholinesterase inhibition or nmda receptor antagonism
1171034 the body of preclinical and clinical data generated thus far convinces me that dimebon is exerting its effects through a different mechanism the data presented today support the hypothesis that dimebon improves mitochondrial dysfunction this is a novel mechanism that may in part explain the clinical benefits seen in alzheimers patients treated with dimebon

1171179 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for

1171181 adapun orang orang yang beriman amat sangat cinta mereka kepada allah
1171182 allah mencintai mereka dan mereka mencintai nya qs al maidah 54 dalam hadits
1171183 tidaklah seseorang diantara kamu beriman hingga allah dan rasul nya telah dicintainya daripada keluarga dan hartanya serta semua orang
1171184 apakah engkau pernah melihat seorang kekasih tidak menyukai pertemuan dengan kekasihnya

1171196 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1171197 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law

1171310 i am not happy with games where mota is allowed to blow a 6 run lead in the 9th inning
1171311 glover28 bt82 im still waiting to hear why yost is a bad manager the point is you have nothing to say
1171312 oh and please remember were the 2nd best team in the nl
1171313 brewtown82 whatever if your only comeback is to spit out their current record there is nothing more to say i got into the same arguments with people last season and i was right all a long if you are ok with a lot of blown crap that has already happened to this team there is nothing we can argue about then i wish they were in a better position then what they are in now i am not happy with games where mota is allowed to blow a 6 run lead in the 9th inning i am not happy with games where suppan is allowed to give up 7 runs in one inning i am not happy with games where yost wont send the 2 runners on base with a 3 2 count because he is afraid of a triple play i could go on and on forever but you just be content with their current record and hope the rest of the teams in the nl continue to suck i wish they were better then where they are at now
1171314 since this is a young team he cant really change anything about their batting strategy plus you cant teach power so
1171315 glover28 brewtown82 its not even worth arguing with you about you dont even know what your talking about
1171316 neds knows you can change pitchers before the end of an inning right

1171363 hip check god knows its nice to have bands worth getting excited about particularly in a city like san diego thats almost completely ignored in indie discussions
1171364 contribuiu como ningu m para a queda do comunismo ao denunciar a exist ncia dos gulag os campos de concentra o sovi ticos
1171365 foi um dos grandes contributos exactamente por a den ncia dos gulag ter sido feita na primeira pessoa os livros do dissidente russo t m a for a que t m por serem autobiogr ficos ele esteve no gulag os livros de soljenitsyne t m a for a que t m por serem escritos na primeira pessoa
1171366 i thought the morning practice was good we got a lot of work done that is what we came up here to do the tempo was good bryant johnson tweaked his hamstring a little bit that is why we kind of backed off him as practice went along we will be back this evening and hopefully have another good practice
1171367 very much so it also raises the competitive level of guys it is important that they look good they want to look good for a lot of reasons some of these guys if they dont make the club they are with another team may spot them and they have a chance so there are a lot of reasons for players to perform
1171368 like i always said if things are important to you you will fight about it we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
1171369 for us or for them laughing i didnt see too much i watched the drills nothing too specific you just keepi piecing this puzzle together as you watch your team perform
1171370 it is a little bit and that impacts the players as well i think that will assist the players as well because that will break the ice for them because it is only four days in between
1171371 isaac bruce will not practice he has been taking limited reps walt harris did not practice this morning but he will practice this afternoon
1171372 i believe you are right that was the purpose of coming up here the fields are outstanding as well i thought everything went crisp we mirrored drills on both sides of the field so the timing all measured up the same i thought it was good and we will look at the film and see how much we got out of it i expect tonight to be the same
1171373 i am not going to say that they are common but people have done them for a long time out of the six nfl teams i have been with i think three have done it i think it is helpful as long as you talk about the roster i think it is 80 and not 86 i think it allows for more repetitions and you get better work not everyone wants to do that though because you dont want to bang around guys too much
1171374 we will not have full gear on we will be in shells so there will be a little less contact from that standpoint a little more passing will be emphasized
1171375 this is my seventh camp and they dont ever get any easier personally one of the things i think you have to do to get through camp is listen to your body getting iced down and proper rest is crucial to your survival of camp youve got to get your sleep and let your body recover camp is camp there are things you have to work on so you can be a better player no guy really wants to go through it but its a necessary evil to get better and thats what we want
1171376 we are expecting a big jump from mike very similar to mark roman last year who after playing in the system for a year made a huge jump mike should be in the same boat after making the calls for a year and playing with these guys for a year we feel hell be even that much beter and were expecting an all pro performance from mike
1171377 it was nice a different color jersey a different offense and different guys
1171378 you get tired of hitting the same guys all of the time
1171379 when you have a practice like this between two different teams all it takes is a little hit on a guy to get them to want to stand up for themselves i dont see anything wrong with that as long as you let it go quickly
1171380 it was a good day to come out here and mix it up against the raiders
1171381 its a little different playing against those guys we are so used to playing against ourselves and we got a little bit thrown off guys got a little bit out of themselves today coach nolan spoke about it after practice and so hopefully we come back this afternoon and clean things up
1171382 its good to go against another opponent and i think everybody stepped up their play just a little bit more today than maybe the other practices there wasnt that many mistakes its just a measuring stick i think everybody would say the same thing we still have a long ways to go but we like our progress
1171383 youve got to step up thats what it is its football
1171384 people go down and the next person has to step up you are only as good as your weakest link so youve got to keep working hard so there is no fall off
1171385 he was showing off on the play but he bit on the double move and i was able to come out of it and make the catch
1171386 it was a lot of fun competing against their first team defensive backs and going against hall another virgina tech hokie that was a lot of fun hes one of the best in the league
1171387 it was a lot of fun getting out there and competing against other guys but it starts back in santa clara
1171388 im trying to get some good work and earn the trust of the quarterbacks so that they know ill be in the right place and at the right time
1171389 hearing the terminology it all sounded foreign the first time i got out there in the huddle and alex called the play i just stood there thinking what did he just say
1171390 its getting easier just in terms of having those double days every day and having the same stuff pounded in your head every day things are slowing down
1171391 im starting to understand the terminology better and im just trying to make plays and earn a spot
1171392 get your mitts off me im not the running back
1171393 sometimes with a guy who has arms like that thats really all you can do
1171394 its different those showers come up to right here pointing to his ribs everyone was in there squatting down so they could get under it
1171395 if you can prevent them from catching a ball in one on one then with a little bit of pass rush it should be easy in a game
1171396 he ran a hitch on me on the first one and as soon as we turned around the ball skimmed over my head so the ball was out when we were running so i have to do a better job of disrupting that route because that ball was coming out quick
1171397 i love that drill because i think its an opportunity to challenge myself and challenge the receiver i try to switch it up i never want to give the receiver the same look every time i want to go up and press him and try to throw off the riming of the route the next time i might play off and the next time i might come up and press him again but with a new move its a chess game they try to figure you out and you try to change it up and stay disruptive
1171398 we just work on what the coaches have been telling us throughout the duration of camp stay square and try not to key the quarterback too much until its time
1171399 it was good work and fun to cover new receivers you have to be aggressive against this group of guys
1171400 it was a 7 pump route i used a double move the db bit and the quarterback threw a great pass
1171401 coach sully says to stay coachable and do what he tells me what to do so it was just to see if i could go out and execute the way hes taught me against our defensive backs against new competition it was fun competing against someone else and seeing different coverages but you do have to stay the same and not change your game
1171402 hes an aggressive corner he plays off sometimes and he likes to play bump and run because hes got great speed so i just had to go out there and do what i was coached to do and not play differently because of him coach sullivan said i did a pretty good job
1171403 its just sticking with your technique being fast and being physical they are known for being physical so we had to come out and be physical not just in one on ones but throughout the whole practice
1171404 this has nothing to do with 2 0 anything although i guess you could see it that way

1171423 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1171424 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1171425 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1171426 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1171427 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1171428 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1171429 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1171430 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1171431 the festival is a wonderful thing in our community and we should be careful to not lose the things we really value
1171432 it is very much a part of the inner fabric of our city every year and how we define ourselves
1171433 everybody thought it was safe kids were just out playing youd go look out your window check on them youd see them and go back in but seeing as how this happened right at the front door of the childs residence thats not the case anymore
1171434 when you lose that last game especially in the state championship it really hurts and you dont get a chance to go back and redeem yourself it was a long off season but our kids worked hard we felt great about our off season program strength and conditioning program
1171435 were going to have to work on getting a little bit quicker because we dont have the mud to help us but its going to be an experience
1171436 players are a lot faster on turf and we dont have the fastest team but we definitely have to work on that
1171437 there is much more carbon in our natural forests than we thought
1171438 this means the potential amount of avoided emissions is much larger and therefore theres much more to be gained from protecting them from logging
1171439 it means the risks of logging are bigger than we thought
1171440 to be fair to the ipcc and the greenhouse office these are their default volumes
1171441 they were calling for better local data and we have produced that
1171442 we are thrilled to have todd on board as we develop the golite brand
1171443 todd brings 12 years of sales management experience with a proven track record of helping companies grow he is a fantastic addition to our team
1171444 this is a tremendous group of people and a company with unlimited potential for growth i very much look forward to the challenges ahead
1171445 we looked at half of australias remaining forests and our estimate is they can store around 33 billion tonnes of co2 these are very big numbers
1171446 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the soil released into the atmosphere that would be the equivalent of about 80 per cent of australias annual emissions every year for 100 years so we really have to protect our natural forests
1171447 its the big old trees that have a very high amount of carbon and also the coarse woody debris the dead standing trees and the dead logs on the ground that are there in the natural undisturbed forests
1171448 they were crossing the road in herds youd splatter them with your tires
1171449 were learning to live with gypsy moths its here to stay its been here 150 years it comes and goes but we are successfully slowing down its greater advancement
1171450 there seems to be kind of a consistent level of gypsy moth activity there over time
1171451 from year to year it will expand or contract a lot has to do with the moisture in the spring
1171452 well definitely expect to see gypsy moths in here next year
1171453 they can take a couple of defoliations but if you really have something greater than 50 percent of the crown defoliated over a couple years in a row then you start to worry about mortality
1171454 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified
1171455 its something that happened you cant live in the past
1171456 you have to move forward and try to live everyday for the future and thats whats important
1171457 raise everything to a higher level good is okay but great is even better
1171458 i think that we have to understand that this is a period that everybodys going through something
1171459 we just have to readapt what were doing and continue to do a good job for the people that we serve here in dallas county and let them know that this too shall pass
1171460 a wealth of experience plus a fresh new perspective to the department
1171461 i nostri agenti non si sono scontrati con i dimostranti n sono rimasti coinvolti in disordini con essi e non hanno interferito con lattivit di raccolta delle notizie di giornalisti o arrestato alcun contestatore
1171462 linsoddisfazione nei confronti dei risarcimenti governativi per la demolizione delle rispettive abitazioni
1171463 well we just wanted to begin to start our healing process
1171464 i believe that this has happened twice in collin county and i think the citizens of collin county and also the surrounding counties should be aware that uh things are happening that could put their family in jeopardy
1171465 the biggest fe mod you can make is to adjust the nut behind the wheel
1171466 ooo look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happyland in a gumdrop house on lollypop laaaaaaane
1171467 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
1171468 stato un colloquio assai utile a chiarire le rispettive posizioni hanno detto i promotori plinio rosso e monteleone
1171469 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo
1171470 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
1171471 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
1171472 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
1171473 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
1171474 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
1171475 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
1171476 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1171477 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
1171478 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
1171479 after studying the schedules of real madrid and the dutch team i realised that playing for both sides would mean too tough a physical challenge for me so i have made this decision i am taking no chances and after an enjoyable uefa euro 2008 i can look back with a good feeling

1171484 steal from motor vehicle offences have been more widespread across residential areas its not just happening in the caravan parks and the hotels
1171485 residents need to be vigilant about locking up valuables and securing their vehicles
1171486 it is very important to fuel the body properly in the preparation time before the event otherwise you can run your body into the ground

1171488 when he was born the midwife said i dont know if you are catholic but if you are start saying some prayers
1171489 we would love to have had a kid without any problems but nick is nick he has his own character
1171490 we look back to when he was born and see how he has grown up and wish we didnt worry as much early intervention in dubbo and the spastic centre has provided us with so much assistance
1171491 it was difficult when he was little because his disability was more noticeable he had a special seat in his stroller so people would stare
1171492 because someone acts differently doesnt mean they feel differently society needs to be more accepting
1171493 nick cant fully dress himself but he can feed himself and get himself a drink of water but things like making a milo or cleaning himself up after the toilet he cant do
1171494 integration of children with disabilities is really important because it changes the attitudes of people and makes them more accepting
1171495 nick is a big sports fan he loves hockey and the dubbo city hockey club lets him play the first five minutes of every game when the two club teams play each other
1171496 nick will never be self sufficient but hes such a fun loving guy and hes a special part of our lives

1171505 historically michigan has had a slight democratic edge but most polls show it to be a lot tighter than normal
1171506 12 is high compared to where it was in 2004 and 2000 just about at this juncture of the campaign where you had 6 8 as i recall
1171507 we have a new face on the scene with obama a lot of people feel they dont know him very well and they really want to get to know him hes reaching out in those areas

1171516 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
1171517 the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response to the camaro concept continues to remind me of the uniquely iconic place our products can have in customers hearts
1171518 camaro is much more than a car it symbolizes americas spirit and its love affair with the automobile
1171519 the new camaro will be almost identical to the concept a thoroughly modern interpretation of the 1969 model considered by many to be the best design of the cars first generation
1171520 we intend to make the all new camaro relevant to younger buyers while retaining its appeal to current fans
1171521 the beauty of the best camaros is that they have always been beautiful to look at with performance that rivals expensive european gts yet they were practical enough to drive every day and priced within the reach of many new car buyers
1171522 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
1171523 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
1171524 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
1171525 i dont know that wed get t shirts made that say it but we take pride in not leaking we take pride in not being a typical campaign
1171526 when all the layers got peeled back they were actually leaking
1171527 there is a feeling now that were going to win this thing and people are starting to talk about who is going to be what a few months from now
1171528 the small team atmosphere has changed and that has caused some frictions on the inside
1171529 based on the way were all sitting you cant tell where everybody fits in the hierarchy and thats a good thing

1171532 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1171533 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1171534 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1171535 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1171536 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1171537 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1171538 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1171539 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level

1171541 the tendency toward violence is generally directed toward young people and women these people are unable to resort to state institutions to resolve their conflicts when there is a dispute they prefer to ask for help from their relatives instead of going to the police they have a tendency to take care of their own business when they settle in a new region they prefer places where their fellow townsmen have already settled because of this they cannot adapt to the citys structure and benefit from the opportunities it presents
1171542 this is a very delicate subject for us we are really working very hard for an effective commission

1171584 a recurrent line of protestant polemic used to boast that the greater success of protestantism in cultivating the conscience accounted for the capacity of protestant nations to develop economically and technologically half of this may be discounted as merely self congratulatory the other half has a measure of ambiguous truth which lies in the reformations success in unlocking the introspective energy of monastic spirituality and giving it wider currency in piety outside the cloister but the very means by which this was achieved tended to make it short lived how long could introspective prayer remain a social force once the protecting walls that had nurtured it were torn down

1171597 every now and then weve got to see whos on top of the mountain

1171602 coach said tuesday night we needed to show a little more life and excitement and to cheer everybody on and encourage them
1171603 i guess they decided to take it a little overboard
1171604 we just didnt cover like we had been covering actually we ran the blitzes pretty good but we did not cover in the back end we werent intense enough the way weve been covering in the previous practices the offensive guys were catching the football without being contested and thats not good
1171605 they think theyre pretty good when they have a good day so i have to be careful about giving them too much sugar
1171606 its important they show just the things weve been doing up to this point not making mistakes playing real hard and finding out who can play football without some coach yelling at em to move over or line up here or do this or do that
1171607 something is wrong with the system and we have to address it

1171614 part of what these stories do is make us wonder how probable their visions of the future are what makes the best of these stories remarkable and important despite or perhaps because of whatever flaws they may possess is their resistance to any one reading traditional science fiction may suffer an aversion to ambiguity but the stories in pump six traditional as they are have a complex relationship to this aversion displaying it in the symmetry of their structure but assuaging it by doing what science fiction does best proposing worlds of what if that are meaningless unless the reader participates in the extrapolation thinking about how to get there from here and what getting there might suggest about who we are individually and as a species

1171624 everyone was shouting when we got to the area his friends had uncovered his head then we concentrated on uncovering his torso the problem was the weight of sand on his body and all our efforts went into getting the sand away from his chest
1171625 the family were shouting at him to help himself believing that he was conscious and able to help us
1171626 the sand would have been wet and firm to begin with but once the tunnel was dug air would have got in and dried it out and that is why it collapsed
1171627 wet sand makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1171628 we were on the beach when everyone suddenly started running towards the dunes the boys father and lots of other people were trying to dig him out i couldnt watch

1171632 t j had a little soreness in one of his legs and so we thought it would be best to sit him out because were trying to prevent injuries
1171633 this is the time in camp where you get the pulled hamstrings and if someone like him starts to get a little sore were going to rest him and make sure it doesnt go into something thats long term
1171634 im trying to do everything i can to make the team
1171635 it was very disappointing not to get drafted but it just makes you more hungry
1171636 once i found out about my sexuality i wanted to have sex all the time

1171642 its not my view its not my private view i simply used loose language i made a statement i shouldnt have made
1171643 they may wrap the thing up in blankets but it doesnt put it to bed
1171644 i think mr english sees himself as the one the who drives the policy and he sees mr key as just the front man the one who goes around the country smiling nicely and saying nice things that people want to hear
1171645 i think this formulae which they repeat like a mantra that there would be no sales in the first term is simply a code for of course we have discussed these things we think it is very hard to get elected when you say you will state owned assets
1171646 it does raise serious doubts about where they really come from the issue here is not what do you say before an election but when the pressure comes on when the crunch comes on where are your gut instincts and i think mr english has made it clear where their gut instincts are
1171647 if we ever decide we want to make a change to that we recognise the importance that new zealanders place on that issue and we would never make a change to that decision without a mandate from them
1171648 it is still pretty tight at the moment we have got about five beds and are hoping to have another nine in the next couple of hours but we are not sure how many admissions we are going to get either

1171650 contrary to rda claims strong efforts were made to address and arrange medical cover
1171651 both dhbs and rda previously agreed that minimum staffing levels outside ordinary hours must be maintained to avoid unacceptable risk the minimums being breached are a risk to both patients and resident doctors
1171652 understandably dr green along with other medical professionals are not willing to place themselves again at such a high clinical risk
1171653 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1171654 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1171655 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1171656 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1171657 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1171658 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1171659 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1171660 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1171661 these refrains which always contain a prayer or a doxology were undoubtedly sung by the people in chorus while the hymn was sung as a solo by a cleric
1171662 ephraem was not putting forward his personal views on the subject
1171663 his opinion is diseased similar to the infirmity of bardaisan his whole mythology is sickly
1171664 it is by adam we die the death of here below it would have been right that he who came should have given life here below that he might render recompense for the usury paid

1171670 let the see of seleucia which is one of the eastern cities be honoured likewise and have the title of catholicon and let the prelate thereof ordain archbishops as the other patriarchs do that so the eastern christians who live under heathens may not be wronged by awaiting the patriarch of antiochs leisure or by going to him but may have a way opened to them to supply their own necessities neither will any injury be done to the patriarch of antioch thereby seeing that he has consented to its being thus upon the synods having desired it of him
1171671 john the persian presiding over the churches in the whole of persia and great india
1171672 not only india which extends from the shores of the kingdom of persia as far as quilon a space of more than twelve hundred parasangs but also your own country of the persians lies in darkness deprived of the light of divine doctrine which shines forth through bishops of the truth
1171673 but other metropolitans that is to say of the chinas of india of persia and of samarcand situated in very distant countries hindered by mountain ranges infested with robbers and by seas fatal with shipwrecks and tempests so that they cannot come to us so often as they otherwise might wish shall take care to send every sixth year letters of consent and union and in the same letters to set forth any business of their countries which requires an opportune remedy and they shall take trouble that from all cities great and small be sent to the patriarch what is right according to the ability of each man and the canons of the fathers for the expenses of the patriarchs house
1171674 john the persian presiding over the churches in the whole of persia and great india
1171675 the christian community of india was in a flourishing state and that many miracles were being wrought in the country by the apostle st thomas whose feast the indian christians were celebrating with great pomp and magnificence
1171676 in the island of taprobane to the interior india ad interiorem indiam where the indian ocean is there exists a christian church where clergy clerici and faithful are found whether further also i do not know
1171677 these bishops were chaldaeans and had come to quilon soon after its foundation they were men illustrious for their sanctity and their memory was held sacred in the malabar church they constructed many churches and during their lifetime the christian religion flourished especially in the kingdom of diamper
1171678 there are here thirty thousand families common in faith with us and they pray god for your prosperity also the church of st thomas is now again inhabited by christians it is distant a journey of 25 days situated on the sea near a city called meliapor in the province of silan our province in which the christians dwell is called malabar and has about twenty cities in all these christians live and churches have been built about twenty portuguese live in the city of cannanor when we arrived from ormuz at cannanor we presented ourselves to them said that we were christians and explained our condition and rank they received us withgreat joy gave us beautiful garments and twenty drachmas of gold and for christs sake they honoured our journey more than it deserved we remained with them for two and a half months and they ordered us that on a fixed day we also should perform the holy mysteries i e should offer the oblation they had prepared a proper place for prayer which they called the oratory and their priests offer sacrifice every day and complete the holy oblation for that is their custom and rite whereof on nosardel sunday after their priests had celebrated we also were admitted and performed the holy sacrifice and it was greatly pleasing in their eyes we started thence and arrived among our christians who dwell at a distance of eight days from that place
1171679 it is now five and forty years that a certain armenian bishop by name jacob abuna has served god and your highness in this country he is a man who is about as dear to god on account of his virtue and holiness as he is neglected and despised by your highness and in general by all who have any power in india god thus rewards his great deserts himself and does not think us worthy of the honour of being the instruments whom he uses to console his servants while i have been writing this i have seemed to myself to be serving and doing a favour not so much to that pious bishop as to your highness for at present your highness is very greatly in want of the goodwill and intercession of a man very acceptable to god as he is this bishop very greatly deserves such treatment on this account if on no other that he has spent much labour in attending to the christians of st thomas and even now et nunc in his all but decrepit old age he conforms himself most obediently to all the rites and customs of our holy mother the roman church i would urge your highness to write it him a letter full of all manner of expressions of your favour esteem and affection
1171680 the archbishop therefore took upon him to declare the popes briefs to be null and void as having been obtained under false pretences
1171681 receive kindly our venerable brother the archbishop of angamale and so to contrive that here and elsewhere he may experience your humanity and love
1171682 the venerable brother the archbishop of angamale who had been grievously vexed by some persons
1171683 order the viceroy and governors of india to take steps that he be not oppressed with any injury
1171684 who were over his head as a hammer over an anvil
1171685 to be obedient in the lord to mar abraham your archbishop and to george the bishop of palur and in sincerity of faith and simplicity of manners persevere and live in the unity of our holy mother the church
1171686 mar joseph having breathed his last and mar simeon having been deported to portugal mar abraham alone governed the malabar church till the year 1597 when he closed his life at angamale from old age after having committed the church to the charge of archdeacon george of christ
1171687 i remained in the country of india where stands the church of st thomas the apostle for thirteen months and in that reign baptised in different places about one hundred persons
1171688 the people persecute much the christians and all who bear the christian name
1171689 on palm sunday 1348 we arrived at a very noble city of india called quilon where the whole worlds pepper is produced
1171690 as a matter of fact they chaldeans seem to have had but the name of nestorians but not to have held nestorian errors for i see nothing in these men that are here which may have a bearing on that sect envy seems to have found its entry among the maronites jacobites coptes and other christians of those regions likely both on account of the name and on account of the fact that they outnumbered the other sects in population as well as in the state and frequenting of the churches for down to india their churches extend
1171691 it remains for the question of the role of the bishop of rome in the communion of all the churches to be studied in greater depth
1171692 before he could undertake a new voyage to india he died at rome
1171693 from portugal he mar joseph was forwarded to rome where he ended his days but in what way or how long after his arrival there the historian gouvea has not recorded the abrupt manner however in which he closes his account of this bishop tends to awaken suspicion respecting the causes of his death
1171694 here rome the piety and erudition of the bishop aroused a feeling in his favour and there was some talk that he would be created a cardinal when his death put an end to any such project
1171695 here is an error to be corrected against the orthodoxy of our abed jesus which raulin together with some others i regret to say has committed in his historia ecclesiae malabaricae p 438 where referring to the mission of the above mentioned mar abraham to india he says that while mar joseph was away from india the christians of st thomas in malabar obtained another bishop abraham from the patriarch abedjesus of the nestorians but the said abedjesus was contends giamil not only not a nestorian patriarch but was even one elected by his catholic chaldeans as patriarch in opposition to the patriarch simon of the nestorians and one approved in the eternal city by pope pius iv
1171696 mar abraham complained to the pope that the fathers of the society of jesus and the latin portuguese tried to withdraw him from obedience to the chaldaean patriarch and to persuade him to demand the pallium directly from the pope in this way they sought to compel him to conform to the latin rite
1171697 this peter no sooner left antioch to go to rome than he appointed a vicar at antioch and this vicar govers the eastern world and is called catholicus and holds the place of peter
1171698 now at that time there was a man of great renown for learning named pantaneus who had charge of the school of the faithful at alexandria where it has been a primitive custom that a school for sacred studies should exist
1171699 there is a church of st george there of the latin communion at which i dwelt and i adorned it with fine paintings and taught there the holy law and after i had been there some time i went beyond the glory of alexander the great when he set up his column for i erected a stone as my landmark and memorial and anointed it with oil in sooth it was a marble pillar with a stone cross on it intended to last till the worlds end and it had the popes arms and my own engraved on it with inscriptions both in indian and in latin characters i consecrated and blessed it in the presence of an infinite multitude of people and i was carried on the shoulders of the chiefs in a litter or palanquin like solomons so after a year and four months i took leave of the brethren valefaciens fratribus
1171700 mr d albedhyll the master attendant at quilon told me that he had seen this pillar and that it was washed away only a few years ago
1171701 several sources we find that the malabar church was under persia

1171718 nothing could be gained and much lost by an attempt to rephrase what we have said in winnipeg we stand squarely behind our position but we feel it is our duty to insist on a proper interpretation of that position
1171719 to state that it is possible for everyone to carry out this law against artificial contraception would risk creating in the faithful a feeling of despair and guilt
1171720 this collection is an excellent compilation of the best commentaries on the encyclical
1171721 my defence of papal authority at winnipeg did not go down well with my brother bishops
1171722 reference should be made to the canadian bishops documents in the pastoral application of this general direction

1171724 beloved priest sons be the first to give in the exercise of your ministry the example of loyal internal and external obedience to the teaching authority of the church
1171725 we will not have deep renewal in the church until the faithful accept the churchs teaching that artificial contraception is seriously immoral and form their consciences according to that norm
1171726 it belongs not only to the natural moral law but also to the moral order as revealed by god

1171748 the stations complaints committee acknowledged i had been treated in an unfair and unkind manner and that two complaints submitted by my office were justified and the broadcaster has now twice censured michael laws for his inaccurate and unfair comments
1171749 not only were there inaccuracies but the vitriol was disturbing
1171750 we are aware that as employees of a crown entity we are under public scrutiny and our work may be criticised however some of the comments made by mr laws went well beyond those parameters and into the deeply personal

1171757 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1171758 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1171759 so when sen mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure
1171760 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1171761 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy

1171792 i dont believe there is any topic addressed more often and more deeply in scripture than our treatment of the poor the distribution of wealth of resources and the danger of wealth to our souls one third of all the parables and one sixth of all the words jesus is recorded to have uttered have to do with this topic and yet we dont hear the biblical literalists making arguments about that

1171799 i find an outside in style of development to be very helpful it forces you to think of your objects at a high level so your design is driven by real need and then you apply your design skills as you go on when i use a pure bottom up style i write more speculative code and go down the wrong path far more often than id like thats not to say that its a problem inherent with that style but rather a problem that ive personally experienced and have more or less solved by using an outside in approach

1171823 and you might say the pedophile would do no damage but once it was pointed out to you you have a duty of care to those underage children not to put them in a situation of risk

1171831 18 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men 20 and they straightway left their nets and followed him 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 22 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
1171832 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
1171833 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
1171834 14 then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not
1171835 15 then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk 16 and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men
1171836 18 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men 20 and they straightway left their nets and followed him
1171837 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 22 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
1171838 9 and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
1171839 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
1171840 19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
1171841 9 and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him
1171842 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
1171843 13 now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus
1171844 to observe all things that i have teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
1171845 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
1171846 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
1171847 20 and they straightway left their nets and followed him 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 22 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
1171848 27 then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore
1171849 37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
1171850 59 and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father 60 jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god 61 and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
1171851 25 and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them 26 if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
1171852 38 and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me
1171853 57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest 58 and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
1171854 27 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
1171855 33 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple
1171856 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
1171857 by this my father is glorified that you bear much fruit so you will be my disciples
1171858 8 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples
1171859 28 then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee 29 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels 30 but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
1171860 58 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord
1171861 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people 24 and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them 25 and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
1171862 12 now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying 15 the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
1171863 1 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations 2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined
1171864 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
1171865 14 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about 15 and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all 16 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised 20 and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him 21 and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears 22 and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son 23 and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country 24 and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country 25 but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land 26 but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow 27 and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian 28 and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath 29 and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong 30 but he passing through the midst of them went his way
1171866 35 and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed 36 and simon and they that were with him followed after him 37 and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee 38 and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth 39 and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and cast out devils
1171867 42 and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them 43 and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent 44 and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
1171868 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
1171869 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
1171870 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
1171871 23 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people 24 and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them
1171872 24 and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them
1171873 21 and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught 22 and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes 23 and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out 24 saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god 25 and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him 27 and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him 28 and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee
1171874 29 and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john 30 but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of her
1171875 38 and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her 39 and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
1171876 40 now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them 41 and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ
1171877 25 and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan
1171878 45 but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter
1171879 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
1171880 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
1171881 no one has the right to hear the gospel twice before everyone has heard it once
1171882 44 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god 45 but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming 46 then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles 47 for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
1171883 14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher 15 and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things
1171884 16 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses
1171885 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
1171886 36 but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me
1171887 3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him 4 god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will
1171888 23 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities
1171889 47 then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles
1171890 14 and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it 15 but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves 16 saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
1171891 was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago
1171892 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1171893 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1171894 many evolutionary biologists have argued that the different forms of crimson rosellas arose or speciated through ring speciation
1171895 we found that in the case of crimson rosellas their three separate genetic groups dont show a simple link to the geographical distribution of the colour forms
1171896 for example orange adelaide and crimson kangaroo island rosellas are separated by 15km of ocean but are genetically similar conversely genetic dissimilarity was found in the geographically linked yellow and orange populations in inland south eastern australia we rejected the ring hypothesis because it predicts only one region of genetic dissimilarity which should occur at the geographical location of the join in the ring around the headwaters of the murray and murrumbidgee rivers however it is possible that crimson rosellas formed a ring at some stage in their evolutionary history but that the evidence has been lost through climatic or environmental changes
1171897 this patient registry assessed the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon based ablation using radiofrequency energy for the treatment of be hgd at 16 u s academic and community institutions
1171898 results were promising showing that 90 2 percent of patients were free of high grade dysplasia at an average of one year follow up and avoided many of the adverse events associated with other modalities currently used with this disease
1171899 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
1171900 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
1171901 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
1171902 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways
1171903 smoking cessation interventions would be more appropriate for the british childhood cancer survivor study cohort than smoking prevention interventions because a high proportion of the survivors were older than the age at which most individuals initiate smoking i e 20 years of age
1171904 it is time to think well beyond our disciplinary boundaries and implement inter ventions that we know are efficacious such as provider delivered counseling and pharmacotherapy and seek solutions for the social conditions that serve as a trajectory for a lifetime of smoking
1171905 as a leader in the field of information technology uc san diego has a responsibility to reduce the amount of energy required to run scientific computing systems
1171906 project greenlight will train a new generation of energy aware scientists and it will produce energy consumption data to help investigators throughout the research community make informed choices about energy efficient it infrastructure
1171907 if we are going to continue to allow ourselves the benefits of advances in computing we need to understand power and cooling requirements much better
1171908 scientists from all domains will choose more efficient systems as they invest in new cyberinfrastructure and we expect that greenlight will give them the data they need some scientific computing jobs need more powerful processors some can do with less memory some can use specialized processors these are important requirements to understand so the optimally configured cluster can be chosen and scheduled through virtualization techniques each and every time
1171909 using the sun modular datacenter as a core technology and making all measurements available as open data will form a unique internet accessible resource that will have a dramatic impact on academic government and private sector computing
1171910 by placing experimental hardware configurations alongside traditional rack mounted servers and then running a variety of computational loads on this infrastructure greenlight will enable a new level of insight and inference about real power consumption and energy savings
1171911 we will be running full scale applications on full scale computing platforms so we will be able to draw conclusions about the comparative amount of energy that is consumed by one workload versus another
1171912 we expect that this new approach will re define the fundamentals of computer systems engineering and accelerate adoption of a transformative concept for the computer industry green cyberinfrastructure
1171913 if the networking is transparent the scientists wont care where the computers are as long as the data gets from their devices and back to their screens without delay
1171914 the full scale greenlight instrument will measure monitor and make publicly available real time sensor outputs using a service oriented architecture methodology empowering researchers anywhere to study the energy cost of at scale scientific computing
1171915 its the fastest way to construct a controlled experimental facility for energy research purposes
1171916 computing today is characterized by a very large variation in the amount of effective work delivered per watt depending upon the choice of the architecture and organization of functional blocks
1171917 the project seeks to discover fundamental limits of computing efficiency and device organizing principles that will enable future system builders to architect machines that are orders of magnitude more efficient modern day machines from embedded systems to high performance supercomputers
1171918 we are asking 25 faculty and researchers to work with us with no money for students summer salary or even system administrative support
1171919 we wouldnt be able to retain them and get usable data if we were only offering toy scale computation
1171920 the workshop will feature lectures on the frontiers of green cyberinfrastructure the hardware software and middleware of the greenlight instrument
1171921 and participants will engage in working groups to provide feedback on the projects development and outreach plans going forward
1171922 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early
1171923 now he chavalia gets to get back on with his life
1171924 im not saying he went up there to kill her
1171925 he couldnt tell tarika had a child in her arms
1171926 they confirmed what our sense was and our belief was in this
1171927 its another example that theres very low value on black lives in this community
1171928 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid

1171938 why zucchini blossoms fall off the plant your zucchini plant looks healthy it is covered in lovely blossoms then one morning you walk out to your garden to find all those blossoms lying on the ground the stem is still intact and it looks as though someone took a pair scissors and cut the blossoms right off the stem is there a crazy marauder cutting your zucchini blossoms off no not at all this is perfectly normal there is nothing wrong with your zucchini plant why do zucchini blossoms fall off the plant there are 2 reasons why zucchini blossoms fall off the plant male zucchini blossoms this is the most common reason for zucchini flowers falling off the plant zucchini plants have male and female flowers only female zucchini blossoms can produce zucchini squash once male zucchini blossoms have opened to release their pollen they simply fall off the plant many times a zucchini plant will produce only male blossoms when first in bloom to ensure that pollen will be available when the female blossoms open the male blossoms will all fall off making it seem as though the zucchini plant is losing all of its flowers dont worry female blossoms will open soon and you will get zucchini squash poor pollination zucchini blossoms will also fall of the plant if the pollination between the male and female blossoms are poor basically the plant will abort the female blossoms if they are not pollinated well enough poor pollination can happen due to a lack of pollinators like bees or butterflies high humidity that causes the pollen to clump rainy weather or a lack of male blossoms while zucchini blossoms falling off the plant may look alarming it is perfectly natural and is not an indicator of any problems with the plant itself

1171966 he was tall skinny and hungry i must have seen him every day for six months
1171967 ele era alto magro e faminto devo t lo visto a cada dia durante seis meses
1171968 did he tell you one day not to come back because he was leaving schlieben

1171974 itll be brilliant just think about it wed have brilliant babies you and me
1171975 theyd have my brains and my good looks and my hair oh my hair
1171976 and what exactly are they going to get from me
1171977 oh dont worry theres things we can do to make sure that you dont pass on any of your human dna
1171978 you wouldnt even have to be pregnant with all of them how about you carry half of them and ill carry the other half
1171979 your family would love it wilf would make a great great grandad great great grandad eh see what i did there
1171980 thats a scurrilous lie there are lots of plants in the tardis
1171981 one of them tried to gnaw my arm off this morning
1171982 ill have a word with her see im a firm disciplinarian
1171983 just sleep with me just once and if you dont like it
1171984 if i dont like it youll give up on this bloody daft idea of us having kids
1171985 well i think we can call that experiment a success
1171986 i didnt know it was actually possible to pierce your lung with somebody elses rib
1171987 oh please dumbo in what species can you get pregnant doing what we just did
1171988 i suppose you want to know why im lying under your bed in the middle of the night clutching a syringe
1171989 well i certainly wasnt about to steal a sample of your dna while you slept in order to breed a legion of small ginger time lords
1171990 just the usual i phoned gramps had a bath oh and i transferred my time lord consciousness into that cactus
1171991 and dont ask me how i did it because its all double dutch to me now
1171992 well i was a bit sick of it really i was starting to sound like you i wanted to slap myself half the time it was getting confusing so if you want to mate with anyone try the plant
1171993 well youve already done the impossible so now im gonna try i dont know how but im coming to get you
1171994 well either this makes me special or the biggest whore in history
1171995 this baby needs to be on board the tardis has to be
1171996 ill be surprised if he doesnt throw me into the vortex or chuck me out on some inhospitable planet and then run off
1171997 no no no this was both of us you wanted to see if we could act out the time we slid down the lift shaft in new new earth
1171998 all i said was that i felt a bit left out because cassandra had taken over my body at that particular time and it was your idea to try it naked
1171999 it could have been good it could have been brilliant
1172000 doctor in case you had not noticed we are hanging from a chandelier in the stairwell of my fathers mansion we are one hundred percent stuck and stark naked you know what my mother said she would do if she caught sight of your willy again don t you
1172001 oh shut up just how are we going to get down
1172002 i don t know but it s good though isn t it ay ay
1172003 no it is not it s bloody uncomfortable why do i have to go on the front
1172004 really rose i am a man and i am naked i do need some sort of protection
1172005 and i don t what is that sticking in my back
1172006 oh yes sorry about that but your rear end does look rather appealing from here
1172007 you can forget about that completely maybe forever at this rate
1172008 go on then but hurry up we ve got to figure a way of getting down before mum gets back
1172009 what would your other self say if he could see us now
1172010 he would probably say nice one doctor give her one from me
1172011 just spit it out human time lord metacrisis here thanks about to have my head explode
1172012 but youll let me stay even though this is a one off thing
1172013 no you daft alien that was a thank you dont expect it to happen again
1172014 only once the process starts i wont so im not gonna be able to help you
1172015 well it was a couple of years ago and we cant be one hundred percent sure itll work in the same way with a body thats already human and i still cant get hold of the doctor on his phone but apart from that ive got a pretty good idea yeah
1172016 if it works back to normal memories mostly intact my brain doesnt go the same was as amy winehouses dignity everyones a winner the only bits that get wiped are those when my time lord consciousness was active including all that nonsense with the daleks and now
1172017 of course its me i found a way back isnt that great
1172018 no nothing its just not the best time right now
1172019 i cant believe you you never touched me when i travelled with you and then three weeks after bad wolf bay you have another woman in your bedroom
1172020 has rosie posie been bad does she have to get punished
1172021 well not sexrobot she can also do a lot of other things
1172022 how could you do something like this and her outfit did you always had fantasies like that no wonder you got all those strange clothes in the wardrobe room god you really are a dirty old man arent you
1172023 its just that this whole situation is so incredible stupid i mean i caught you with myself in a bizarre way and your face oh god i wish i had a camera right now first time i ever saw you blush
1172024 excuse me im not blushing time lords dont blush we are very unblushing in every blush ish way thank you very much
1172025 586 positions of gallifreyan kama sutra eh care to show them to me cant be outdone by a robot can i
1172026 well technically speaking they arent crosses yet these poles stand all the time you see the romans like their people to remember what it means to choose wrongly they become crosses when the condemned comes bringing the last part with him the weight on the shoulders
1172027 theres some rope there in the pocket of my trousers
1172028 or the time after that or the time after that but the time will come and itll be my choice and ill fall
1172029 right between i think i have to and im doing it right there
1172030 you make the leap you spiral down and you might be surprised at this do you know what helps faith no really its sooooo much easier to go over that edge when theres some faith about youre good at that arent you rose i wonder when i fall again i wonder if youll be the one to help

1172034 you betrayed my trust and you put all of our lives at risk ianto
1172035 i know i thought if i told anyone about lisa they would just want to dissect her and study her i owed it to her to try and save her you know she would have ended up in a lab jack
1172036 to be honest im more upset that you hid yourself from me than i am about a cyberwoman in our basement i trusted you ianto do you think i trust just anyone
1172037 i know you dont jack i didnt say anything at first because i was scared and then i didnt know how to bring it up when exactly was i supposed to tell you about her jack you didnt give a fuck about me so long as i am here to pick up after you
1172038 quit acting like some betrayed housewife im your boss not your lover you are the one who harboured an alien threat
1172039 i never said you were jack i just wanted to explain why i didnt tell you i didnt think you wanted to know about my life i just thought you would understand why i did it you know what it is like to lose someone you love ive heard you calling out in the middle of the night
1172040 the difference ianto is that i would not let someone i love stay here if they were a risk to my friends the safety of your team should come above everything else ianto
1172041 i know and ill admit ive made a mistake i wont do it again
1172042 you do and ill kill you betrayal is the worst crime someone can commit in my eyes ianto
1172043 yes sir i will never betray you again jack i didnt mean what i said sir
1172044 ill put it down to you grieving for lisa but if you talk to me like that again ill hit you
1172045 you dont look as hot as normal ianto are you sleeping okay
1172046 no my apartment seems too big i kept it because i thought lisa and i would be living there someday im going to look for somewhere else
1172047 you can stay here for a while we havent got another bed but i can be persuaded to share
1172048 ianto he went of here without even looking at us and hes pale
1172049 he only did it because he loved her jack you cant punish him for that
1172050 we almost died because of him tosh ianto shouldnt have brought her here
1172051 i know that owen i know that i was wrong and because of me an innocent woman is dead you dont have to keep saying about what i did because i was there
1172052 stow your gear anywhere you want we can find somewhere proper to put everything later
1172053 she died here its not fair to make him stay here you dont have to have him here so you can watch him
1172054 lets get you settled im sure youll feel better after having a decent nights sleep we can deal with everything else over time just remember that you are not alone anymore ianto we are more than your colleagues we are your friends
1172055 hey are you doing okay over there im jack im not going to hurt you
1172056 can you tell me your name or do i just call you welshman
1172057 thats a name i havent heard before do you want me to take you to your place
1172058 its a variant on the name iefan the welsh version of john i ive been staying at my dads i cant tell him that i was al almost raped i have keys to a friends house could you drop me off there
1172059 can we go for a drink later jack just the two of us
1172060 yes sir i think we need to talk about a few things
1172061 do you want to go for a drink here or at a pub
1172062 here some things we need to talk about are a little sensitive
1172063 come up to my office in a couple of minutes
1172064 i started to remember the day after lisa died you are a fucking bastard jack harkness you raped my mind
1172065 dont you fucking dare jack i am not your sweetheart you stole my memories of us my memories of being with someone i loved or was that all a lie did you just want someone around for a convenient fuck
1172066 i could have spent every night fucking a different person if all i wanted was sex i love you what made you remember after all this time
1172067 hearing you talking about my beautiful welsh vowels sparked something in my memory
1172068 i thought i was losing my mind when i started to remember or that id been dosed with some alien drug i even tested my blood for every alien pathogen and drug on our database i thought lisa was the first person i had loved but it turned out to be you do you want to hear something terrible now i can remember you i realise what i felt for lisa pales in comparison to how much i felt for you i loved you jack
1172069 i dont know if i can trust you again jack never mind love you stole my memories and you havent even apologised
1172070 i am sorry but i thought it was for the best i needed to get into torchwood so i could find out what happened to me and i thought it was too dangerous for you i couldnt take the chance that you would be hurt because of me or be used against me do you have any idea how i felt knowing that you didnt remember ive spent every day for the last three years having you in my reach but i couldnt touch you
1172071 so what was your great plan that i would remember you and fall into your arms i hate to break it to you but this is real life and you cannot just push my emotions aside i need time to think about how i feel about you and what you did
1172072 im not leaving jack i have to think everything through
1172073 you can have the next three days off any more and we would collapse without you
1172074 dont let anyone touch my desk ive got it perfectly organised
1172075 i take it you mean owen i want to give you something before you leave
1172076 i saw it a couple of months before i was stabbed it was supposed to be our anniversary present i knew as soon as i saw it that it was perfect for you its beautiful just like you and the colour of the face reminds me of your eyes i kept it because i knew that we would meet again
1172077 how did you know that did you recruit me just so you could get me into your bed
1172078 no i offered you the job because i knew you would be perfect for it you have a strength cunning determination and intelligence that make you a wonderful person and a great asset for torchwood you have the ability to focus on what needs to be done regardless of whatever turmoil you are experiencing inside
1172079 i wouldnt say something i dont mean you are amazing ianto
1172080 there you go ill be here when you get back
1172081 ive got my phone if you need me jack ill see you soon
1172082 ianto asked for time off and i granted his request
1172083 ianto never takes time off are you sure everything is okay did he seem a little off when he asked for leave
1172084 iantos fine and he has his phone iantos not going to get in any trouble
1172085 ianto im just calling to see what youre doing no nothing is wrong no owen hasnt been at your desk no we havent given jack instant coffee i will ill have to go but call me if you need anything
1172086 morning sir heres your coffee sorry i wasnt here to make it for you first thing
1172087 you are the only one who seems to make a decent coffee in this place ill have to give you a raise
1172088 another one sir at this rate im going to be a millionaire in a few years
1172089 you deserve it those heathens tried to give me instant can you believe it
1172090 ill make sure to send a memo instructing them to buy instant on pain of death sir
1172091 please do ianto if they do this again i will have to insist on using my minions as target practice they are lucky that i havent decided to fire them for trying to poison me with this flavoured water they call coffee
1172092 having a melodramatic day again jack i thought we agreed that calling your team minions isnt conducive with a productive and efficient team
1172093 its not like im calling you a minion i think youd make a more attractive consort
1172094 youre just skirting the edges of harassment again captain can i ask why you destroyed the place
1172095 short version is that the sauce for myfanwys food fell on the table she turned up to get her food and destroyed the table sending pieces of wood and everything on it flying
1172096 that was a bad move his coffee is toxic to everyone but him and ianto ianto probably has enough caffeine in his system to neutralise the sludge that is jacks coffee
1172097 no more than normal newbie this is sane for jack he hasnt had a no clothing day yet or a leather only week when he does youll see what the rest of us have had to put up with for so long
1172098 no we were out in the field most of day so we were exempt ianto was naked for a couple of hours before jack decided he was too distracting
1172099 yeah jack looked pretty shocked i think he felt ianto wouldnt have the balls to call his bluff i have to admit that ianto works out more than i had expected
1172100 ianto naked they were just filling me in on some memorable work days here thanks for the coffee
1172101 we havent had one of those days for a while ill have to think of another theme ill tell ianto youve been thinking of him owen
1172102 jack what the hell have you told everyone about me
1172103 ive had one call from tosh and three from gwen who also sent me two emails all to ask what im doing when im coming back and to let me know that theyre there if i want to talk owen sent me an email saying no matter what anyone else said hes not interested in me that way but i do have a good body what is he talking about has he been inhaling some of toshs experiments again i thought we had agreed that they should be kept in a secure area
1172104 i told them that you wanted some time off theyre just looking out for you just ignore owen ill go and make sure his mind is still in this reality
1172105 i know they have the best of intentions but im not helpless jack i can be left to take care of myself i managed it for years before i met you
1172106 swansea before you start worrying im not staying with him
1172107 good ill tell the others to leave you alone im here if you want to talk
1172108 ianto just called and asked me to let everyone know that he is okay he seemed to think you were all a little worried about him if you wont take his word for it take mine i wouldnt let ianto leave here if i thought there was something wrong
1172109 its not that we dont trust him hes been through a lot with lisas death and then almost being eaten by cannibals thats a sentence i never thought id say
1172110 iantos tougher than you give him credit for and he knows we are here for him im making this an order leave ianto alone until he comes back to work or calls to speak with you
1172111 i bet that jack and ianto were having it off and i won
1172112 how does jack telling us to leave ianto alone translate into them having sex
1172113 jack wouldnt do that for any of us and hes normally the first to talk about someone why would ianto phone him if there was nothing going on not to mention the eye fucking thing they have going on
1172114 havent you ever noticed the looks they have been giving each other since lisa jack is kind of over protective of ianto always has been i reckon thats why ianto doesnt go into the field very often
1172115 hes no different with ianto than he is with the rest of us
1172116 wrong gwen jack touches ianto more than any of us and always has jack makes a point of asking how ianto is every day since lisa died i know that could be a way of helping ianto feel connected to the team but its not when we found out about lisa he seemed to take it personally that ianto had been hiding things from him deeper than any of us
1172117 jack is not fucking ianto they can barely look at each other recently it seems like ianto cant even look him in the eye sure he still does things for jack but he seems a little frosty towards him
1172118 you dont have to like someone to fuck them and they are fucking tosh obviously believes me or she wouldnt have paid up
1172119 enough talking lets get back to work before jack comes down and asks what weve been doing i am not going to explain to jack harkness that weve been having bets on his relationship with his subordinate
1172120 afternoon mam its been a while since i came to talk to you ive had some pretty amazing things happening recently my girlfriend lisa died and she tried to hurt my friends but even then i couldnt kill her does that make me evil ive found out some things happened that i couldnt remember
1172121 remember jack i told you that he was my boss and i found him intriguing jack did something to me that took away my memories they were special because they were of someone i loved that someone was jack and we dated for year its made me a little suspicious of his motives for employing me i dont think he would recruit me unless he thought i was capable of the job because hes a decent man but at the same time there was a desperation in his eyes when he looked at me that lets me know that hes been longing to have me near ever since we parted my memories of jack tell me that he loved me and i loved him i felt as though i belonged when i was with him being in his arms made me feel safe loved and he made all those voices in my head telling me i was useless weak and ugly disappear
1172122 jack said he had no choice but to make me forget and he might be right he couldnt have got to where he is now if he had been involved with me i know we work for an organisation that is supposed to be above prejudice but its not a few of the people in command wouldnt have accepted someone with a male partner as leader even though he is the best man for the job im talking as if jack and i would have been together if he hadnt wiped my memories i know it might sound silly but i really think we would have been a few months after he left me jack became the second in command at torchwood two in glasgow for two years a few days after he became leader of torchwood three jack recruited me im still trying to convince myself that the fact that he recruited me first doesnt mean he had an ulterior motive i suppose it makes sense that he would recruit someone to do all the admin work archiving and general support work first the place was a chaotic mess when i started working there and jack just left me to work knowing now that we had been involved makes that decision more understandable he knew that im good at organising and researching ive always thought it weird that jack buys the same coffee for work that i buy at home but now i think it was just another way he was looking after me i like that he was looking after me that hes protective of me im so used to having to be the stoic one the one who never lets his emotions go but even before i remembered jack i knew he wouldnt look at me oddly if i got emotional
1172123 ill let you be alone but im here every day if you want to talk if you cant see me just ask in the church and ask if anyone has seen emily jackson
1172124 im going now mam ill be back to see you soon and i might bring jack hed probably like to meet you again since he spent so long talking to you last time you know he never did tell me what you were talking about but jack likes to be mysterious
1172125 good morning mr jones youve got an emergency phone call
1172126 mr jones my name is sara smith im a doctor working at cardiff royal infirmary we have a patient here called jack harkness do you know a mr harkness
1172127 mr harkness had it in his wallet mr harkness is in a very serious condition would you be able to get here soon
1172128 yes ill be checking out today but ill pay for the whole three days of course
1172129 jack its me i i just had a rather strange call this doctor said you were in cardiff royal infirmary in a very serious condition i was worried i know you cant die but i know you can be hurt not to mention if someone found out you cant die they might decide to experiment on you
1172130 im an old hand at escaping from difficult situations it sounds like this woman wanted to get one of us alone probably you ill put you on speaker phone so you dont have to go through this twice
1172131 okay i know i didnt mention it but im happy youre okay
1172132 youre on speakerphone now so talk me through what happened
1172133 i was just getting ready when i was told there was an emergency phone call for me i went down and took the call it was a woman who said her name was sara smith and that she worked for cardiff royal infirmary she said that there was a jack harkness there in a very serious condition and that she found the number to contact me in his wallet i didnt want her to know i was suspicious so i told her that id be at the hospital in an hour
1172134 there isnt room in my life for another jack harkness
1172135 are you staying in the place you stayed in last time you went to swansea
1172136 no im staying at maries hotel i havent stayed here since easter 2001 but im in the same room i stayed in then
1172137 it looks like whoever is trying to get you know a lot about your past look dont move a muscle until i get there i should be there is around forty minutes ill get the police to clear the roads for me and give me priority i want you to stay on the line with the hub if anyone tried to get in your room just hit them dont worry about getting in trouble with the cops have you got your gun
1172138 i dont have my gun but im sure i can fashion a weapon out of something nearby you dont have to come out here yourself jack
1172139 where else would i be when you need me ianto
1172140 since youve got a while until jack gets there how about you answer some questions for us
1172141 it was compulsory when i was in torchwood one and i just got into the habit as the receptionist i have to dress smartly so it gives a good impression we could be inspected at any time and i wouldnt want to cause any problems
1172142 iantos room was broken into and he switched off his phone we cant get in touch with him
1172143 fuck go to my desk and open the top drawer theres a safe the code is 060900 i want you press the switch in there tell me what is says
1172144 that display is linked to ianto i want you to keep an eye on it if it says anything other than that i need you to let me know right away
1172145 it doesnt matter ill give you a call once i get to the hotel
1172146 jack because of you the love of my life died now is your turn to feel as though your heart is torn in shreds ianto may not be as beautiful as my anne was but i think he does have a certain charm if you can find him within the next seventy two hours then you can have him back by the way your time started at 10 17 and i am exact to the minute
1172147 gwen i want you and owen to come to swansea to help find ianto tosh do a search on the computer for an anne who was connected in any way to a case and died because of me i dont remember an anne but the man who kidnapped ianto said the love of his life called anne died because of me this anne might have something to do with the doctor that supposedly called from cardiff royal infirmary everything else is on hold until we get ianto back tosh it might have something to do with my work at torchwood two so check those files as well move now people
1172148 we came as soon as we could what did the police say
1172149 they have nothing gwen not one of the twenty people the bastard tied up knows what he looks like the woman who owns the hotel has admitted that she set ianto up the guy who kidnapped ianto made her tell ianto that he had an emergency phone call it was a fucking set up to get ianto to call me because somehow that bastard knows that i would never leave ianto in danger
1172150 not at present the man who took ianto said that he wanted me to know what it was like to lose someone i loved if he even touches one hair on iantos beautiful head i am going to make it my purpose in life to destroy him and everyone around him ianto is mine and no one is allowed to hurt him
1172151 how did this guy find out about your feelings jack
1172152 i dont know ianto and i havent been involved for years ianto didnt remember it until lisa died
1172153 i made him forget ianto and i started dating on june 25th 2000 just a few weeks after we met we had a good life together we laughed and loved ianto saw something dangerous something that could have meant his death so there was no choice but to give him amnesia pills the only ones who knew about our relationship were the couple who owned the restaurant we went to and a few guys at some clubs we frequented ianto didnt tell anyone at college that he was seeing anyone and he kept to himself a lot so no one suspected anything
1172154 why didnt ianto find out about your relationship from these people
1172155 ianto never went back to any of the clubs or the restaurant because i wiped them from his mind enough gossiping i need to find ianto before the monster who took him inflicts more damage than i can heal we have until 10 17 on tuesday morning to find ianto or he will be killed
1172156 im running the prints through our database right now jack itll take another hour or so
1172157 were running them through every criminal database in the world and the entire torchwood database thats billions of files to be checked jack i havent found any reference to an anne smith in any case files from the last two years but ill keep looking ill let you know if we have anything before you ask iantos life signs are still within acceptable levels ill tell you if they change
1172158 im going to see iantos father to see if he knows anything owen collect all the evidence im hoping some of the blood in there might be from iantos attacker the police have already taken fingerprints but we need a dna sample its room 61 gwen i want you to interview everyone again in case the police missed anything
1172159 im here about your son mr jones can i come inside
1172160 you can call me huw what has he done now
1172161 ianto is one of the finest people i know and he would never do anything my name is captain jack harkness and ianto is on my team i am here because ianto has been kidnapped has anyone been to see you asking any questions about ianto
1172162 i know all about you you are the one who has been raping my son now iantos escaped from your lecherous clutches you fabricate some story about him being kidnapped so you can get him back you are too late iantos best friend paul smith has already taken ianto to safety where you can never find him
1172163 mr jones i have never raped anyone in my life and i would die before i hurt ianto if you dont tell me what this paul bastard smith told you i will have you imprisoned and arrange for you to be fucked by the biggest most violent men until you die dont think that i wont do it because when it comes to ianto i cant control my temper you have until i count to ten to tell me
1172164 the guy said that his girlfriend worked with ianto his girlfriend sara had been trying to convince ianto to report you for raping him there was some kind of accident and she died after that he became good friends with ianto and convinced him to escape from you i dont know anything else
1172165 if i find out you have left anything out or that you had something to do with iantos kidnapping i will come back and carry out my promise you are not to have any contact with ianto ever again not a letter a phone call nothing
1172166 tosh ive got some more information the woman is also called sara so check either sara anne or anne sara she worked with ianto i dont know when but there arent many cases were someone has been killed when ianto was present
1172167 ive already read a file about someone called sara anne her name was sara anne richards she was a police officer who died during iantos first field mission about two and a half years ago she died during a hostage situation ianto and sara were cornered by weevils you saved ianto
1172168 i didnt even know her name it seems her boyfriend has ianto so i need everything you can get on him find out if he or this sara had any connection to swansea it seems a little unusual that ianto was kidnapped here there were plenty of other opportunities to get him
1172169 hello paul i dont suppose you would let me go
1172170 no but you get full marks for trying believe me ianto this is nothing personal if jack harkness had another weakness i wouldnt have gone after you but he doesnt
1172171 jack killed my one true love and he didnt give it a second thought i want him to know what it is like to lose one he loves and he loves you i followed jack to this house two years and five months ago shortly after my love died jack keeps his diaries here ive read them and he describes how he felt for you and how he loves you still ive been watching him since anne died and he still loves you he is softer around you he kept loads of photographs and mementos of the relationship he had with you
1172172 with respect i have never been involved with jack we havent even kissed i have never kissed a man in my life
1172173 you really dont know do you you were dating jack for a year your relationship started a few weeks after your 19th birthday his diary said he had stolen these memories from you i had imagined you would have got them back by now but perhaps whatever he drugged you with is more powerful than i had anticipated
1172174 ive only ever dated one person and jack killed her
1172175 now you know why he murdered her in cold blood because he didnt want you to have anyone in your life but him
1172176 that bastard how could he take her away from me she was my everything we were going to get married in two years in the same church her parents were married in
1172177 jack probably planned to kill anyone you were close to from the moment he reappeared in your life why else would he have recruited you three years ago jacks been planning this all along thats why he recruited you six months before anyone else so that for months in was just you and him allowing him to get close to you just so he could betray you
1172178 paul jones is a cardiologist who graduated top of his class his personnel file says he is highly focused and is very loyal he has published one article in the last year exploring the effects a number of poisons have on the cardiac system his interests include cross country running rock climbing and military antiques his neighbours reported that he has a number of antique guns locked away in cases and an extensive collection of swords they dont remember seeing him since two days ago
1172179 no one knows anything about him one of the hostages said that the guy seemed to be out of it for a few seconds before having weird mood swings he seemed to go from excited to depressed to angry every quickly it seems the guy is unstable meaning that ianto could be killed before the time limit
1172180 the police have agreed to join in the search but they would like a little more to go on
1172181 this little creature was manufactured in a laboratory on a planet far away its bite injects a drug that temporarily heightens someones psychic abilities since ianto and i are trained to receive and send telepathic communications i am hoping it will allow me to get in touch with him weve got about forty minutes before it kicks in so its time to get down to business
1172182 tosh has been trained you werent trained owen because you never worked for any of the other torchwood commands and we no longer have the training as part of the induction process gwen
1172183 yes ianto knows my presence so he wont shield his mind against me
1172184 gwen get to paul jones home and go through everything with a fine toothcomb owen see if anyone at the hospital knows anything about his personal life i want to know everything about him where he vacations where he met his girlfriend everything tosh i need you to go through all footage we have of scenes ianto and myself visited together i dont care where it comes from check the archives the internet the cctv cameras everything we need to find out how long this guy has been planning this and how much he knows about us
1172185 why do we need to know what he knows about us
1172186 i need to know if he got into anything about ianto look over everything personnel files psychologists reports performance assessments we need to know how much he knows about ianto so we can figure out if he knows how ianto would react to being kidnapped
1172187 what do you mean isnt it obvious how he would react
1172188 no some people panic others get mushy or angry but not ianto that fucker has seriously underestimated my ianto because he is stronger than people think ianto is a cunning compassionate devious downright stubborn intelligent survivor who will do everything in his power to escape ianto is not going to let some insane vengeful piece of scum take him down
1172189 owen you better than anyone should know that people can be a lot more than they appear on the surface how many people get to see the real owen harper now everyone get to work the clocks ticking
1172190 i will take you but your hands are going to be cuffed together until we get there i will let you go inside by yourself but i will be waiting outside id hate to have to hurt you for trying to escape so just behave yourself
1172191 i wont cuff you to the bed since you cant do any harm in this room ill be back to check on you later ianto
1172192 i dont want to make this unpleasant for you ianto believe me if there was any other way to make jack suffer i wouldnt be doing this it isnt your fault that jack harkness is a cold hearted murderer obsessed with you
1172193 i know where iantos being kept the house is very well guarded the cameras are running on a generator that isnt accessible outside so we cant simply set them up on a loop along with the usual cameras there are four infrared cameras that rotate every five minutes i have some clothing that will bend light so we wont be seen but our body heat will give us away
1172194 does that mean that there is a brief blind spot
1172195 there is but only for a minute and we need more time than that to get inside ill drive us out camera range and get inside alone im the best person to go inside because i know the layout
1172196 i own it it was going to be a gift for ianto a place to relax gwen stay here and man the phones tosh i need you to contact the police and make sure all the roads on the way to the house are clear i dont care what line you have to spin we are to be given priority owen you are with me but if you do anything to upset ianto your life will not be worth living bring a fully stocked med kit in case ianto has been hit its not like he would tell me if he was hurt
1172197 ianto doesnt like to appear weak or injured in front of anyone the only reason jack ordered owen on the rescue mission is because ianto might need patching up iantos going to be okay jack would sell his soul if it got ianto back safe and sound
1172198 its time for something to eat ianto ive made some cawl using a recipe my grandma gave me after you have finished we are going for a little walk
1172199 i thought you might like to see the beauty of our country one last time you deserve to see something beautiful before you die ill be back in forty minutes with appropriate clothing
1172200 jones has decided that it would be good for ianto to take a look at the beauty of his homeland
1172201 hes planning on killing ianto soon he wants ianto to see something beautiful before he dies he probably had no intention of letting ianto live until the deadline it would make me hurt more to know ianto had been killed long before i could save him it would make me think that ianto could have been saved if only i was quicker
1172202 how are we going to get inside without being seen if jones is outside
1172203 get that look off your face owen iantos not some inept coward hes intelligent and brave ianto is capable of more than you think he rigged up the electrified fence when you were trapped with that weevil ianto might not be as extroverted as you but he is every bit as important to the team more so in some ways
1172204 nothing as simple hes the archivist the system administrator and the general support ianto is a highly skilled computer hacker and analyst he has access to all areas of torchwood areas that you have never seen and will probably never see ianto has access to highly sensitive information that even i would have to ask for access to and at torchwood one he was yvonnes personal assistant you never met yvonne so you dont know how rare it was for her to trust someone ianto was hand picked by yvonne to eventually be her successor she told the leader of torchwood two and i that if anything happened to her we were to take ianto into our team she ordered us all to complete iantos training because he was the one person she felt could be a great leader
1172205 hes not ianto is strong and hes already a leader havent you noticed that he can run rings around us without anyone noticing hes a great judge of character and highly skilled in the art of negotiation remember ianto was intelligent and skilled enough to get a cyberwoman into our base without anyone noticing not to mention he managed to get together everything lisa needed to survive
1172206 are you sure youre not just thinking with your dick
1172207 iantos beautiful but i wouldnt go this far for a cute piece of ass owen
1172208 you ever imply that ianto is here simply because of our past relationship or because of his devilish good looks i will happily feed you to janet actually scrap that ill feed you to myfanwy and tell her you made ianto sad
1172209 do you mind if we go this way i proposed to lisa about five miles north of here
1172210 of course not if it makes you feel at peace and safe we can easily go there i dont mind a small walk
1172211 im fine he didnt touch me he seemed almost sad that he had to kill me in the first place
1172212 owen give ianto a look over in case he was hurt by this bastard if anything happens to ianto because of you ill give you enough retcon to make you think you are the biggest flamer possible and that all women are evil
1172213 i can do anything because i own you dont worry youll still love sex tosh has always believed you are latently gay anyway i can convince gwen that you were only into her because you were trying to deny your true nature
1172214 not until i say so teaboy touch your nose with your left index finger and balance on one leg any nausea or dizziness who are you what day it is and what year where are we
1172215 a bit no ianto kevan jones saturday and 2007 i dont know the exact location since i wasnt awake when i whisked away by prince charming
1172216 since you are your normal passive aggressive self id take it you are okay you dont seem to have a concussion or anything which means you are okay ill do an ultrasound and x rays once we get back
1172217 pick him up and put him in the van he wont be able to move now
1172218 it injects a toxin that temporarily disrupts the transmission of electrical impulses to the limbs without disrupting the respiratory system hell wake up in three hours with any side effects and it stops him from causing any more problems
1172219 now that youve all seen iantos okay we are leaving you can contact me at iantos if you need anything but it had better be important like cardiff is being invaded or else
1172220 im fine it was just a bump on the head and jack can keep an eye on me i just want to get some sleep without having to worry about some insane vengeful creep planning my death ill come in tomorrow to get x rayed if anything happens well call you right away
1172221 hello beautiful i am not hurt i am going home i will be back later
1172222 good morning to you too sweetheart you wouldnt wake up i yelled and shook you
1172223 im awake now what are you doing here where are we
1172224 im here because you were hurt and were at your place
1172225 right i knew that i just forgot for a moment because im half asleep are we going in today
1172226 yeah owen is going to give you a check up im making something to eat do you want cheese or beans on toast
1172227 its okay yan just stay there while i get owen
1172228 dont tell me what to do im not some puppy you can order about
1172229 i know you arent and im just worried about you because i love you can you please just stay there for me
1172230 owen something is wrong with ianto it took me an hour to wake him and he is being sick should i take him to the hospital or do you want to come here well be there in ten
1172231 of course now i know you arent going to have a hissy fit are you dizzy
1172232 you either lean on me or ill carry you down there myself
1172233 im hardly going to try and kill you with jack watching its possible you may have pcs
1172234 whats pcs and how do you know if he has it
1172235 post concussion syndrome and its a simple test called the rivermead postconcussion symptoms questionnaire ill do an mri and x rays as well the most important thing is that he remains calm
1172236 why dont you talk to me instead of acting like im not here
1172237 thats a yes on irritable or easily angered im going to ask some questions and i want you to give me an answer on the scale of zero to four zero is not experienced at all one is no more of a problem two is a mild problem three a moderate problem and four is a severe problem i need you to be completely honest and if you dont understand the question just tell me
1172238 i have a small headache im not stupid just get on with it
1172239 compared with before you got hit on the head do you now suffer from headaches and or dizziness
1172240 a three i guess for both but its worse now than when was it i got hurt again
1172241 are you easily upset by loud noises or having any sleep disturbances
1172242 zero to both but jack said he had problems waking me im normally a light sleeper
1172243 it seems you have post concussion syndrome the best treatment is anti nausea pills painkillers and rest pcs may mean you have a few days at worst case months of poor concentration mood swings and fatigue well keep you under constant supervision for the next couple of days i want to do mris every four hours and i need you to let me know if you feel worse i know you feel shit im going to do my best to treat the symptoms but there are limited drugs i can give you considering your allergy
1172244 go get what you need owen ill stay with ianto
1172245 i may be selfish bastard at times but i wouldnt do anything to hurt him go and get whatever you need
1172246 im going to be incapable of thinking straight for months which means i cant even do filling im alternating between wanting to go into hiding until this passes and wanting to make paul regret ever coming near me of course its going to change everything jack who am i without my job
1172247 you are ianto jones beautiful brave determined drop dead gorgeous intelligent did i mention beautiful you are the one i want to share my life and my bed assuming you can forgive me for fucking everything up you are more than just your job yan did i tell you that i love you
1172248 thats great can you pass me a bedpan so i can throw up
1172249 just a sip whos going to take over my duties while im recovering
1172250 you and gwen can job share gwen doesnt need to be in the field and she wont mess up your filing system like owen would or get distracted by new technology like tosh
1172251 fine are we going to increase her security clearance in case you need something from one of the vaults and im indisposed
1172252 no she hasnt been here long enough to get anywhere close to your security level to be honest i cant risk giving anyone else access to such equipment and information until i know everything about them and trust them to do the right thing if the fate of the world is on their shoulders i like her and i trust her to an extent but not with the information you have shes not like you yan she couldnt cope with the sacrifices youve made and the sometimes distasteful information you have to handle
1172253 i dont always do the right thing i almost killed us all by keeping lisa here
1172254 true but you recognised that lisa had to be stopped i know you yan if you had truly believed lisa couldve been saved you would have shot me when you had the chance you would kill if you truly believed it would keep someone you loved alive you knew she had to die to save us all even if you couldnt kill her i never got the chance to say sorry for asking you to kill her i shouldnt have put you in that position i was being a cold hearted immoral bastard
1172255 you were angry and jealous angry because i had kept a secret from you and jealous because i had fallen in love with someone other than you i may not have much experience with love but i can read you jack i learnt years ago how to read people it kept me alive dont ever make me kill someone i love again jack if im going to be out of commission for a while you can have a list of my contacts just in case there is an emergency the list is in a safe behind the bedside cabinet in my apartment the combination is 04451379
1172256 i want to get my emotions under control first and think over what im going to do without torchwood being the centre of my life
1172257 ill talk to the girls and let them know whats going on ill ask gwen to go to your place and get some toiletries and things
1172258 shes too curious and i dont want her wandering around my home tosh will respect my privacy and she knows a lot about me already so she wont go looking for clues as to my lifestyle and try to analyse me
1172259 tosh it is ill let the girls know what is going on just give me a call if you need anything ill keep the cameras on you as well
1172260 hes going to be okay owen seems to think he has post concussion syndrome but its something we can treat tosh can you go to iantos place and get his things together
1172261 just get enough for overnight hell probably be coming home tomorrow i dont want anyone going in there and crying all over him iantos not dying or anything hes got a small head injury hes asked for some time alone to deal with everything so do not go in and disturb him if he asks for me come and get me
1172262 ill be downstairs finding out just what paul jones planned for ianto and just how he got access to highly classified and secure information just stay here in case ianto needs me and man the phones
1172263 hello paul my name is jack im going to be your torturer today please feel free to scream as much as you want
1172264 no that would be the weevil in the cell next to you
1172265 i always knew you were nothing but a cold blooded killer
1172266 actually im a pretty easy going kind of guy until you hurt one of mine you were going to kill my ianto for that alone you deserve to die but he would feel bad if you were killed so ill let you live youll just be missing a few pieces now where to start
1172267 having fun lets see what part would it hurt more to lose a leg an arm or something else
1172268 i teach welsh twice a week at a community centre im not going to get to class this week could you phone steffan as soon as possible just let him know that ive got a small minor head injury and ill be there next week the number is in my address book under steffan bowen
1172269 i can do that for you im here if you need to talk about anything is everything okay with you and jack
1172270 my relationship with jack is nothing to do with you
1172271 ill go and do that call for you do you want something to eat
1172272 yes ianto just wanted me to make a call for him about his class ill go make that call
1172273 i think shes just shocked about the two of us and seems to be a little scared of me
1172274 i prefer to think of myself as passionate you seem to be very calm have you been meditating
1172275 a little mostly repeating that this is some crazy nightmare and we are still in bed im not that lucky though you didnt kill him right
1172276 i think you need to ask yourself what is more important working for torchwood or rhys eventually keeping everything a secret is going to get to you and youll find yourself becoming cold towards him out of fear that he might find the truth jack is trying to warn you when he keeps talking about how you should have a life outside of torchwood because eventually this place will take over your life until the day you die and are housed in the vault below
1172277 of course everyone in torchwood who has died since 1980 whose body or body parts could be collected is buried here it is secure and some have obviously died in suspicious circumstances lisa has her vault as does susie and those who fell at canary wharf it is my job to maintain the morgue meaning every month i go through the deceased to make sure they are all there as part of your job you must examine the vault
1172278 okay why do it in the first place its not like they can suddenly go walking about
1172279 it is possible they can be infected with some unknown pathogen mimicking death or simply have been harvested for food or spare parts you have to be ready for anything working here gwen there are 600 vaults that must be checked each one has a name and a picture of who died if they are too decayed to be matched to the photo each has a dna profile that is accessed by pressing the top left corner of the vault take a sample and run it through the scanner if it doesnt match you must tell jack immediately
1172280 yes but only when my job required it it would be ridiculous to spend my time looking at her body it would prevent my moving on i have other places i can go if i want to think about her a place that lisa was connected to when she was alive rather than where her body is
1172281 of course not jack understands i will always love lisa just i understand there are people he will always love the feelings each of us have for our former lovers in no way detracts from the love we share jack and i are happy together we each have someone who understands us completely and who understands the job that we have
1172282 jack i love you but if you dont stop treating me like im fragile and weak im going to kill you repeatedly or worse ill cut you off from sex for the next month
1172283 thats cruel and unusual punishment yan im just looking after you because i care
1172284 i know but having the cctv cameras follow me from here until i get home is bordering on obsessive i do not need a nursemaid or a mother jack i am a grown man who is more than capable of taking care of myself
1172285 i feel the same about you jack for all we know at any time the tardis energy inside you could stop working and i could lose you but i refuse to allow such thoughts change how i treat you lets be honest our job is dangerous and a torchwood employee is lucky to survive the job for ten years before being killed or disappearing in suspicious circumstances we need to make the most of our time together not panic about what could happen
1172286 thank you now are you up to pizza for lunch
1172287 of course could you pick up some elderflower water on your way back and my dry cleaning
1172288 now youve settled your lovers tiff and iantos got you wrapped around his finger again jack what are we having for lunch

1172291 hi ianto im surprised your man isnt accompanying you again he seems a little overprotective since you got mugged

1172298 im afraid so the paramedics advised his family and friends had better get up there to see him asap were still investigating the accident he was taken to the heath im sorry gwen
1172299 there was a hit and run ianto was the victim hes been taken to the university of wales hospital and its serious andy said the paramedics informed him that any family should get there as soon as possible they are still investigating the accident
1172300 were here for ianto jones he was brought in around half an hour ago from an rta
1172301 im afraid we can only give information to his family please sit down until his family arrive
1172302 look bitch my partner is in there possibly dying and you are not going to stop me from seeing him now you can either let me through or i can arrange for you to be fired for discrimination and i will have you ruined
1172303 i am iantos next of kin he has no family dr harper here is his physician and these ladies are his sisters
1172304 fine let me show you to the family room while the doctors are treating mr jones
1172305 ill try but they might not tell me anything ill be back as soon as i have some more information
1172306 my name is dr veronica white i am the consultant who was treating ianto unfortunately ianto has a brain aneurism however the location makes it untreatable at present he is in a stable condition but unfortunately it will rupture at some point causing his death i cannot give you a timescale it could be a matter of hours or days it was probably a result of being thrown into the air you can see him now please do not upset him
1172307 i need to see him alone i wont be long
1172308 sorry jack it looks like im going to leave you earlier than we had both imagined
1172309 no its surprisingly really i love you jack will it hurt
1172310 no yan i can make it quicker for you if it starts to hurt
1172311 i couldnt do that to you jack i dont want the others here when i die it would be too embarrassing and it would upset tosh
1172312 okay ill get them to leave although tosh may be a little reluctant
1172313 youre my best friend and i love you like the sister i always wanted please take care of jack for me you are wonderful toshiko it was an honour to be your friend
1172314 of course ill look after him i i love you too
1172315 its not your fault i guess this is goodbye let me just say that it was great to know you both owen you may be tactless and at times an arsehole but i respect you gwen although you can be headstrong and impulsive i admire you and your caring nature
1172316 jack i cant let you watch me die it will hurt me too much to put you through that i cant see you in pain
1172317 please dont send me away i would never forgive myself if i left you
1172318 mr jones we are going to move you to the intensive care unit once you are situation up there your loved ones can visit at any time it will only take around two hours to get him situated
1172319 page me the second he is ready for visitors i have a pager as do the three people with me
1172320 were just going to the lift now mr jones it wont take long and then you can see your partner
1172321 i know i just worry about him being alone when im gone
1172322 thats only because of where the bleeding is look i know you are trying to help but you are making it worse
1172323 jack do you want me to sit with you by iantos bed
1172324 no gwen this isnt something you can barge into no matter how much you feel it would help to put it plainly you arent welcome and you dont deserve to be there
1172325 just what i said i am going to be by iantos side alone i will not dishonour him by allowing someone else to be there his last moments will be with someone he loves and who loves him in return if i was going to ask someone to sit with me it would be tosh because ianto considers her to be a sister of his heart
1172326 only in name ianto considers his father dead the man doesnt deserve to even breathe the same air as ianto do not phone him gwen or
1172327 im going up to check hes settled ill come down for you later guys gwen remember what i said about iantos father
1172328 dont even think about it gwen there must be a good reason teaboy cut the man out of his life
1172329 just because you dont care about your family owen doesnt mean that other people feel the same imagine how iantos father is going to feel if his son dies before he could say goodbye
1172330 jack knows ianto better than any of us and he loves him more than life itself he would never go against iantos wishes obviously there is a reason why iantos father is dead to him we are not going to speak to the man unless ianto asks us to
1172331 im only thinking of ianto about making sure he doesnt have any unfinished business
1172332 jack i need to have a word with you in private
1172333 i am very sorry but ianto had a seizure in the lift on the way to the icu and stopped breathing despite all our efforts we were unable to resuscitate him i am very sorry but he is dead
1172334 he was but unfortunately his brain aneurism meant that ianto was always going to be at risk we will of course perform an autopsy to find the exact cause of mr jones death
1172335 im sorry love i didnt mean to leave you alone i love you always will ill never forget you no matter how long i live and my heart will always belong to you
1172336 calm down tosh toshiko he wouldnt want you to cry about him leaving us hed be ready to flay us alive with his tongue alone for disturbing the silence you know how ianto feels about the silence how calmly and soothing he finds it
1172337 i cant believe hes gone he didnt deserve to die like that in such a normal way he should have died like a hero with people knowing him for the amazing man he was
1172338 i know but yan never wanted to go out in a blaze of glory he didnt like being the centre of attention he always preferred the shadows
1172339 im going to miss him he was one of a kind
1172340 gwen went for a walk owen went to find her when i told him that iantos status had been updated on the hospitals mainframe i didnt tell them he had passed away i didnt know how to
1172341 ill speak to them soon do you want to see him
1172342 no i dont want my last image of ianto to be of his body are you okay jack
1172343 no but i will be come on i need to tell the others
1172344 jack ive just had an alert on the computer saying that iantos body has disappeared ive accessed the cctv of the morgue and there is something strange
1172345 get everyone in the conference room well get whoever has desecrated iantos body
1172346 i know no one feels like working but tosh has just told me that something has happened to iantos body and i cannot let that go unpunished tosh start the footage
1172347 tosh i want cctv footage of ianto leaving the hospital he didnt have access to his car so he must have caught a cab find out where it took him gwen go through iantos background owen i need you to be ready to perform a detailed examination of ianto ill be back soon
1172348 jack you cant go after him alone he could be dangerous
1172349 not to me gwen go back to the hub ive got my com in case something happens
1172350 if you know where he is why are we looking into cctv
1172351 i could be wrong and we dont know what new memories or instincts that could be governing ianto
1172352 i had gathered as much at least youve kept your beautiful welsh accent do you prefer to be called ianto or doctor
1172353 i am not the doctor although i have heard of him i am his grandson
1172354 no but he knew about my mothers existence which hasnt happened yet the wonders of being a time lord she was believed to be dead and he left her oh i still love you
1172355 im at my flat jack i will not let you put me in a holding cell
1172356 i wont try to capture you i love you ianto
1172357 great now hurry up because i dont like having these conversations over unsecure lines you can let yourself in im having a bath to get rid of the morgue smell
1172358 you dont have to sneak a look jack come in i want to know what you think of my new body
1172359 you look as beautiful as always sweetheart so what is your name
1172360 my time lord name was aleron however i also have the human ianto jones in my head as such my name is aleron ianto jones since ianto is dead to the world
1172361 yes but it is hidden and i cant let torchwood know about it
1172362 are you still willing to work for torchwood knowing that the charter means we are supposed to capture your grandfather and hold him captive
1172363 yes since youve been his companion i dont think youll let torchwood take him prisoner
1172364 of course i wont get dressed and well head to the base
1172365 as much as i would love to spend today getting acquainted with your new body tosh would never forgive me if i dont let her see you immediately
1172366 okay but tonight it is just you me and the toybox
1172367 jacks here and hes got the supposed ianto with him
1172368 everyone meet ianto aleron jones its the same ianto but he is a little more than human
1172369 teaboy was nothing but human ive run tests on him since he joined us id know if he was an alien
1172370 owen to put it simply i was human until i died and my true self awoke if you were to test me now it would become obvious that i was alien
1172371 if you are ianto tell me something that only he would know
1172372 your favourite hangover drink is a strawberry juice with a squeeze of lemon tosh a week after lisa was killed you came to my flat and shared a cup of green tea with me owen on sunday mornings when you come in on overtime you catch up on the latest hollyoaks gossip instead of completing your inventory
1172373 okay youre teaboy get into the medical room and ill look at you i should have your baselines here in case you get hurt
1172374 get out of the way jack i cant do my tests with you hovering
1172375 hmm youve got two heartbeats ill test your blood and make sure everything is okay
1172376 okay you have funky blood that seems to have an extra cellular matrix and be high regenerative open your mouth and ill do your temperature
1172377 fine are you going to start going on crazy exploits like the doctor does any other issues that may appear
1172378 no i happen to like my job a single aspirin can kill me my mother said that she had to regenerate because of it
1172379 fine well lock your file in the archives only jack you and i will have access to your file make me some coffee
1172380 i suppose but dont get used to it i am going to take a more active role in the team meaning i will be going on missions
1172381 thank you everyone ive just got a few things to talk to you all about firstly considering everything that has happened today i am ordering you all to go home you can have the weekend off ive got your pager numbers in case there is an emergency just make sure they are always with you secondly this should be obvious but ianto jones is considered dead and he will remain so to anyone who asks i will be sorting out a new identity for ianto as aleron ianto jones who happens to go by his middle name if anyone asks thirdly ianto will be taking a more active role on missions at his request and with my agreement thats all folks
1172382 sure babe we need to talk about why i want to go on missions now when i didnt want to when i was human when i was human i was terrified that i would cause someones death because i wasnt experienced with going on missions
1172383 now i am a time lord again i can recall all my instinctive training i was created from a machine as my mother was created from the doctor using his genes as building blocks my mother and myself were created from machines that gave us an instinctive knowledge of weapons and military training
1172384 our planet was at war soldiers were created from the progeneration machines to make up for the numbers being killed we emerged approximately 18 22 of earth years old my mother wanted a child who was also a time lord she said there was an instinct driving her on to continue the species
1172385 i see i dont see any reason why you cant come on missions in the future but i need you to pass the weapons training until we find someone who can help out in the archives you will need to continue in your current position as well
1172386 thats fine now lets go back to my place and start the date part of our evening i deserve a treat for regenerating and having my world thrown on its axis

1172388 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1172389 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1172390 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers

1172401 a conservative has concerns about the power of government and the greatest manifestation of that power is in law enforcement after all they have guns

1172408 i think it is utterly irresponsible to speculate about that and i certainly wont be doing that
1172409 i certainly think australian homeowners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank
1172410 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other

1172415 he did run several lights at least three or four that we know of
1172416 there were also other traffic violations unsafe passing and unsafe speeds through construction zones
1172417 as the motorcycle was going too fast to negotiate the turn thats when he kind of slid and hit the front of the truck
1172418 he was lying on the ground and he wasnt moving much

1172430 if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found out about the grenades
1172431 on friday before everybody left this wasnt even in anybodys minds
1172432 but also the small storm that can form right in the gulf and be on our doorstep very quickly
1172433 we had very good talks across all camps came up with a plan emailed it around on the weekend and got agreement everything is on track

1172435 with previous efforts focused on networking or user level applications the gaping need to process and respond to large amounts of data has been inadequately addressed
1172436 our effort will go deep into the system software stack to explore new and better ways to provide system level support for data intensive computing
1172437 the challenge for the computing research community is to find a way to turn massive data into knowledge
1172438 the potential impact in fields as diverse as medicine biology physics meteorology and even the social sciences like economics are virtually limitless
1172439 as the consumer becomes more educated about eco processes these things will eventually trickle down to the mass market
1172440 once simple economics start to take over then people will become more aware of these kinds of things it starts with the niche market it starts with the high end
1172441 people dont want to spend their entire familys budget on clothes
1172442 i dont have as much overhead as say edun does
1172443 i can afford to keep my company in my home and pass along those savings to the customer
1172444 organic stuff is more expensive thats just the way it is
1172445 mass market retailers want the lowest price if youre selling to them are you going to spend an extra 50 cents per yard for a fabric it ends up being a lot
1172446 but when you get into things like t shirts and denim and stuff like that i dont think people should be paying a premium in the long run they wont
1172447 the jcpenney wal mart group those are the people that are ultimately going to make a difference
1172448 i havent heard that those products are doing better than nonorganic products but not broadcasting it in a big way
1172449 consumers are becoming more aware but i will say that fashion and good design need to be an integral part of the end result if consumers are actually going to make the purchase
1172450 target has been very successful in taking ideas from the high end of the market
1172451 if you make it easy for the customer they will do it
1172452 now the old king is dead long live the king

1172454 goes right to an enormous vulnerability that barack has created for himself with his grandiosity
1172455 the questions now becoming who does this guy think he is i think that is the real question
1172456 hey pats with us he just cant come right out and say it because the kikes niggers spics fags whatever will get him if he does speak the truth
1172457 quick hits ifl fighters to affliction great mma book reviews and dana whites net worth
1172458 seems that boston slugger manny ramirez was leaving the ballpark with headphones on trying to look inconspicuous and quickly get away from the crowds still leaving the stadium he started to cross south royal brougham way against the signals of a traffic cop who was directing pedestrians the police officer demanded that ramirez open his wallet and show identification he warned him that he could face a 500 fine and possible arrest for disobeying a police officer
1172459 it became clear to those watching that the policeman had no idea who ramirez was he didnt ask for an autograph or anything but did ask ramirez if hed attended the game after the brief lecture and no argument from ramirez the police officer let him go with no further trouble
1172460 ah maybe baseball needs a higher profile in this town or maybe ramirez has to sit around and talk to the media like everyone else on his team so he doesnt get caught up in post game foot traffic i dont know i just thought it was a funny story
1172461 here this is the worst place in the world to j walk i offended twice today and didnt get caught ive been pulled over here you cant do that here they are serious
1172462 f k this i have to do this because im not letting anyone take charge of my game
1172463 will everyone stop expecting us to do this were trying and we have lugo and whiny manny to put up with give us a break
1172464 we have no issues with that its mainly the heat and humidity
1172465 its not a concern to us the expert advice that we are getting is that the situation continues to improve and the measures they put in place shutting factories and limiting traffic are still having a positive effect no athletes here have been using face masks

1172477 duncan might go a couple of weeks without offering anything
1172478 and i could just get on with things now too often i feel pressurised

1172481 its a brilliant job but a really difficult one and that is something kevin now has to deal with
1172482 the first thing i did was speak to my wife thats the most important thing to me my family i spoke to south africa my mum and dad spoke to them at great length and i spoke to my brothers because this was a huge huge decision for me
1172483 michael gave a very emotional speech yesterday about his family about his mum and dad and about the support they had given him you saw how emotional it was its an emotional decision ive just recently got married and if you look at what michael said about the last nine months and what hes been like at home its interesting to hear
1172484 over the years ive got a good cricket brain in terms of what i think about and how i do things
1172485 the way i play is quite instinct orientated i like to do things spontaneously what feels right in a situation
1172486 i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game i just see this as a fantastic opportunity to grab with both hands and to go with it and run with it
1172487 this is the best i have ever felt with a girl in my life its absolutely sensational she is a family orientated girl from preston and is so caring i love her to bits shes sensational shes the one for me shes awesome fantastic
1172488 i cant see myself having a hectic career for ever
1172489 i had to ask if he was a batter or a bowler i didnt really know who he was
1172490 it was the best of times it was the worst of times
1172491 ill tell you the other thing that was cool and it actually almost overwhelmed me and was great when we went to go to the parade there was a staging area and you get on the bus to go to the stadium and you walk off the bus and you run into harmon kilebrew tony perez brooks robinson who was my dads first roommate ryne sandberg who i hung around with there was about three other guys rod carew steve c it was like boom boom boom it was really neat oh also hank aaron and bob gibson
1172492 dont try to be a hero try to be a winner
1172493 cant i play a game that isnt a nail biter
1172494 hey ca te tente daller prendre une biere a soir
1172495 ahhh jo ca fais longtemps que on sest vu on devrait faire quelque chose ensemble
1172496 there are concerns but that is something we have to deal with and a challenge kevin has to take on people say captains get better with time hopefully that will be the case with kevin but he doesnt have much time before the ashes
1172497 captains have to be respected and that is something you cannot buy
1172498 the only way you can get respect is if you manage yourself and the team properly michael vaughan could definitely do that he was the best captain i have ever played for kevin has to now show he can be as equally good there is no point him trying to be like michael vaughan or michael atherton kevin has to be himself and go by his gut decisions
1172499 kevins got confidence in bucket loads and im sure hell take that into his captaincy
1172500 being captain of england as i well know brings with it a lot of pressure but kevin has shown he can handle pressure as soon as someone puts him under the pump he comes back and makes a big score
1172501 kevin just has to carry on playing his game he is a fine player and there is no need for that to change now he is captain
1172502 there are so many different aspects you have to worry about its not just about preparing yourself and the team for the match but also dealing with the selectors and the media
1172503 you find there is not much time to concentrate on cricket and it can become dispiriting at times as michael found its a brilliant job but a really difficult one and apart from in one one day match kevin has never experienced that this is a potentially tough time for the team
1172504 we are going from having the best captain england has ever had to someone who has never done it before it is hard to say if kevin will ultimately be successful
1172505 he was a little less outlandish or maybe brash is a better word than he became during his first couple of years with england but if his captaincy didnt make any great impression on me i do seem to remember him being fairly tactically astute when it came to his own batting
1172506 that hasnt changed you can tell from the way he works out bowlers and selects his shots he does think about his game as well as rely on his instincts and ability and it was obvious to us then he was immensely talented the question is whether he can translate that astuteness to the bigger picture of captaincy he seems to have calmed down in the last couple of years and is less inclined to covet the spotlight which is a good sign
1172507 i thought he was very good at what he did
1172508 im a fairly opinionated bowler who likes a free rein to set his own fields and he was very open to me doing that which was excellent
1172509 after hed seen the wicket he came up to me and said you realise youll be bowling your full spell which i was very happy with i didnt get the impression being captain changed his demeanour particularly though that side of things didnt intrigue the players as much as it seemed to the press when youre out there playing youre concentrating hard on your own game you dont get too much time to study others
1172510 i remember kp hit a century and took a wicket and i got 23 not out hes got character and he brings character out of those around him as well he has the respect of his team mates and the opposition players and i think that hell take to the role very quickly
1172511 in iraq if need be my job is to play baseball
1172512 he does things with his body i can only dream of

1172528 i think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough hitting each stepping stone just right you wont have to die the truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who arent even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you and have a lot more fun while theyre doing it

1172541 based on the comparison of the urban and regional trends it is estimated that the urban heat island effects are responsible for at least half of the observed surface air warming
1172542 however the urban warming in osaka recorded in the subsurface temperature profiles is significantly greater than what is recorded in the near surface air temperature time series
1172543 this study suggests that the surface air temperature records alone might underestimate the full extent of urban heat island effects on the subsurface environment

1172602 its generally thought that comedians are rolling in cash because they can multiply the number of seats by the cost of the ticket audiences would be shocked to discover how little of the ticket price is going to the comedians

1172666 for bourdieu liberal constitutionalisms promise of a public sphere where the only thing that matters is the strength of your arguments is inherently part of the system of domination in fact bourdieu goes even farther and argues that the poor as a class are incapable of forming truly independent political opinions they cannot have a political position because the system of domination bars them from the cultural capacities it takes to formulate one the distinguishing characteristic of chavista common sense is its radical rejection of deliberation as a way of arriving at political decisions and its flat out refusal to engage critically with those who dissent

1172779 mac users think that they dont need to worry about viruses and spyware
1172780 but e mail is the weak vector on the mac
1172781 this is the one area where the mac doesnt have an advantage in security
1172782 significantly fewer mac users were using anti phishing technologies but they were pretty much identical to windows users about giving personal information

1172840 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1172841 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1172842 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1172843 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1172844 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

1172867 cambodian solders are being patient and adhering to orders from the top not to resort to violence
1172868 if thai soldiers have occupied the vicinity of ta moan thom temple it is illegal as thailand recognizes the temple is located in cambodian territory
1172869 we have official documents demarcating the border which were agreed between france and thailand in 1907 08 the ta moan temples are located near cambodian thai border marker no 23 planted during the french colonial era and are situated on cambodian soil
1172870 thai military deploying at ta moan thom has their duty to look after the border area as usual they have continuously done this mission for a long time
1172871 thai military has been stationed on thai site and never encroached into neighboring country the situation in that area is still normal military of both countries has closely coordinated to prevent crashes and any misunderstanding

1172877 we dont have time to decide if we will attend the na session or not
1172878 it is not right according to law and inappropriate according to the principles of democracy
1172879 the srp is protesting the election results as it wants respect for democratic principles and law and a balance in power between the government and the na
1172880 but if we do so it is contrary to the principles of democracy because the party which has seats in the na represents people if peoples supportive votes are divided to other parties it is not proper

1172899 o pai dele n o teria jamais procurado a justi a n o importa o que acontecesse

1172905 theres a lot of it shelled out on the ground
1172906 we had 4 and a half inches of rain that morning and one inch hail for about 15 minutes large hail and it came straight down and defoliated everything
1172907 it affected all our crops wheat barley canola just depended on the stage theyre in
1172908 the canola field is about 70 to 80 gone sunflowers it took just about every leaf it just shredded them
1172909 ths is spring wheat and i would say about 80 loss

1172915 the novel before you is bad a transparent compensatory fantasy projected by a poor plain woman erotically starving yes but so is jane eyre another bad book is amorphous but so it tristram shandy an author betrays a shocking indifference to all the great political social and intellectual upheavals of his age like jane austen
1172916 we have to read musically testing the precision and rhythm of a sentence listening for the almost inaudible rustle of historical association clinging to the hems of modern words attending to patterns repetitions echoes deciding why a metaphor is successful and another is not judging how the perfect placement of the right verb or adjective seals a sentence with mathematical finality
1172917 say it aloud a few times and it suddenly seems inevitable we need the two words because they sound farcical together and short does not mean the same as little the two words enjoy each others company and the little short legs is more original than short little legs because it is jumpier is more absurd forcing us to stumble slightly stumble short leggedly over the unexpected rhythm
1172918 the thought of having impregnated her was delectable to him

1172920 suggestive of technical efficiency apparatus belongs to a scientific register that puts it at odds with of happiness an apparatus of happiness sounds more like an inverted torture machine than a bonnet and basket and it promises a kind of doggedness a persistence that fits mrs eltons character and which makes the heart sink

1172934 we use ip to allocate value and create incentives in society
1172935 just like many other powerful tools ip can be very useful but it can also be difficult to work with you can easily shoot yourself in the foot with intellectual property if you dont understand how and why this tool works
1172936 in fact i would argue that for most businesses in the united states the intellectual property part of the business is the most valuable part of the business
1172937 we are starting to see a swing away from stronger intellectual property protections and towards more openness and collaboration
1172938 people frequently have the mistaken impression that open source or free software is the opposite of intellectual property that is absolutely wrong
1172939 open source software is open source because of the way it is structured vis a vis the ip laws
1172940 clear correct and deep this is a welcome addition to discussions of law and computing for anyone even lawyers
1172941 thats one small step for man one giant leap for mankind

1172947 for us its been fantastic not only have we been immortalized through motion capture in the epic fantasy saga that is sacred 2 but we got to design our own fantasy musical instruments which has to be every bards dream
1172948 the honour of working with blind guardian was really the crowning of our extremely fruitful cooperation with ascaron after providing almost 500 engine ready 3d assets for sacred 2 including characters armour sets buildings weapons shields amulets and other equipment the fact that ascaron entrusted us with the in game models of the band members clearly shows that modern game development rivals hollywood not only by embracing top talent but by bravely implementing creative processes which are traditional in the world of movie making yet still somewhat emergent in our industry
1172949 if you dream about big things your partners must understand and share your vision and passion ascaron was not gambling for a professional production ascaron has chosen a professional collaboration blind guardian and 3d brigade

1172978 i dont want to take up much of your time but there are a few things id like to say before the show begins there once was a man who wasnt taken very seriously he performed in a circus like atmosphere he wasnt very good at his job i speak of ronald reagan he went from a b rated movie actor to one of the greatest presidents this country has seen my point is first impressions can be deceiving regan acted with a monkey i accidentally called jeff hardy jeff harvey you see everybody in this world makes mistakes but the important thing is we all grow from those mistakes i wasnt the greatest announcer in ecw history and a lot of you wont let that go theres even a petition on wwe com asking for my resignation

1172997 what theyre eating reading wearing all can be deduced from what people throw away
1172998 if theyre eating the wrong food too much food or are wasting food that costs society by identifying who is imposing these costs we can begin to correct the behaviors that cause them
1172999 dieticians could be sent to counsel those exhibiting poor food related skills we could provide healthy menus and food preparation instructions if necessary residents showing signs of obesity could be signed up for aerobics lessons

1173009 our focus is on seeing to it these animals go to good homes were very careful to assess whether or not a potential adopter has the ability to provide a good home to this animal

1173011 the agents gave chase fired their weapons at him several times and hit him once but the wound did not prevent his escape into mexico after the incident there was a cover up including a cleanup of the area of spent shells and failure by the two agents to report the weapon firing incident as plainly required by well established border patrol policies it is well established that the fourth amendment to the united states constitution does not permit officers to shoot a fleeing suspect unless the suspect poses a threat to the physical safety of the officers or to the public
1173012 it is only with the heart that one sees rightly that which is essential is invisible to the eye

1173252 as pioneer works hard to engage the 12 volt community in raising awareness to the consuming public one outreach about which we feel strongly is charity pioneer is of course directly involved in a number of philanthropic programs however a way to build on that foundation is to recognize the good works of our dealers and the impact they are having on a local level

1173604 heroes i served two tours in vietnam including the tet offensive of 1968 i killed someone a nva solider i was elated but years later i can still see my round hitting this guy i never see any heroism in war just death dirt misery and guilt i have never met a soldier or marine who felt heroic we do our jobs to protect our buddies and we want to get home and live our lives as ordinary men not as heroes when you smell death you no longer have a glorified sense of war there is honor and duty but to kill or be killed does not make you a hero i feel for these young people and their families but war and combat are not heroic actions they are doing a job and getting home
1173605 as far as the individual marine goes i think i learned to respect the individual marine the 18 19 20 year old more in this one particular battle than any other time that ive been in the marine corps he was given a job he went up in the fact of danger in the face of just being blown away more or less and he went up and did his job to see the faces of the marines dragging back their dead buddies their wounded buddies you could see how close the marines really were with each other it was true brotherhood and i was really proud at the conduct of the marines

1173613 ive had a lot of struggles in my life this year
1173614 i came here to encourage you and do something about your problems
1173615 youve inspired me to be a better person and make better decisions

1173622 there are thousands of living harvard veterans and more than 1 200 harvard graduates have given their lives in war

1173632 soldiers when they come back from a deployment have often been observed engaging in excitement seeking behavior it includes a lot of people who liked excitement before and soldiers who come back from a deployment and miss the excitement and sense of purpose that comes with a deployment
1173633 cant find adequate ways to fulfill themselves and they become excitement junkies
1173634 operational or combat environments require a sense of alertness all of the time and it is very difficult to turn that off when you return home even though soldiers are glad to be home many found features they enjoyed while deployed
1173635 sure its hot and miserable but there is a sense of purpose suddenly youre home and those senses of purpose or excitement are suddenly gone and people may not want to give that up so quickly
1173636 clearly any person who gets involved with risky behavior puts themselves in a position to get hurt or killed
1173637 upon detection of the problem leaders have many options they can use to help the soldier

1173644 the dispute reflects a broader question roiling the military can psychological traumas no matter how debilitating be considered equivalent to devastating physical wounds supporters of awarding the purple heart to veterans with ptsd believe the move would reduce the stigma that surrounds the disorder and spur more soldiers and marines to seek help without fear of limiting their careers these guys have paid at least as high a price some of them as anybody with a traumatic brain injury as anybody with a shrapnel wound
1173645 the purple heart was meant to be a badge of honor to show you were wounded in battle

1173704 he was a good person and he left a great legacy in the cuyahoga valley park
1173705 he was the original environmentalist he was green way back when he really was ahead of his time he was a man of integrity and made his decisions based on what was right not for their political value and he cared deeply for the country and its people
1173706 im not sure any of us can adequately measure with words the immense contributions john has made
1173707 the true value of his work will continue to reside in his legacy and will be enjoyed by and for many many generations to come his is the work of a remarkable public servant with a most generous spirit and creative mind john seiberling and his family have helped build and sustain this city

1173709 john seiberling stands as a giant in terms of managing public lands an american hero
1173710 what he did was really extraordinary and he truly was one of americas great conservationists
1173711 getting the cuyahoga valley park created in 1974 only whetted his appetite he got involved in alaska and wilderness lands he was the right man at the right time to get a lot accomplished
1173712 and that legacy will touch all americans for generations he truly was an american giant
1173713 he was the expert and made quite the difference every wilderness advocate in the country knew him and worshipped him
1173714 we will never see the land as our ancestors did but we can understand what made it beautiful and why they lived and died to preserve it and in preserving it for future generations we will preserve something of ourselves if we all have an interest in this land then we all have a stake in its preservation there is no more worthwhile cause
1173715 had the foresight and the ability to galvanize public support to preserve the valley it was an incredible accomplishment
1173716 there was a gentle way about him he was so scholarly and so thorough
1173717 he really was a renaissance man an amazing man a giant everyone who ever worked for him said it was the best job they ever had and that was true for me too he was the right person at the right place at the right time to do the things he did
1173718 at the time i knew nothing about the workings of congress
1173719 he was a commanding figure throughout this community and as soon as i got to washington it was clear as it had ever been that he was beloved by the people who knew him best

1173734 transformation of an enterprise begins with a sense of crisis or urgency no institution will go through fundamental change unless it believes it is in deep trouble and needs to do something different to survive
1173735 if these forces to continue throwing money into an ineffective system were allowed to continue unabated one could imagine a system of public education where nearly all administrative teaching support and even cultural functions would be controlled by self serving unionized administrators reducing the role of elected school boards to glorified contract administrators

1173787 i went down to cover a business story the oil rigs and all that cohn said but as things unfolded it still was and is an economic story but its obviously so much more than that
1173788 cohn also covered the enron trials and several white collar scandals that followed

1173795 this marvelous book constitutes a much needed paradigm shift in the story of jazz a shift that skillfully fuses cultural and music criticism with a rich historical sensibility that highlights black genius as an artistic exploration and an existential adventure against the backdrop of our flawed democratic experiment called america griffin and washington are preeminent critics of our time
1173796 griffin and washington explore the lives of two of the geniuses of twentieth century music and follow them as their paths crossed to form what amiri baraka once called the all time classical hydrogen bomb and switchblade band though neither miles davis nor john coltrane were wont to elaborate on their work in words their lives and their music nonetheless still speak to us this lucid and graceful book situates these two men in their times listens closely to what they played and the result is a social and musical history that is rich and always illuminating

1173806 theroux wanders to places that scarcely cross other travel writers minds among tham vientiane a sleepy town on the banks of the muddy river famous for its cheap beer and phnom penh scruffy rather beaten up like a scarred human face in which its violent past was evident he also keeps up a running argument with the books he reads along the way to say nothing of his contemporaries chatwin never traveled alone he harumphs and neither does his bete noire naipaul
1173807 as thoughtful and observant as ever this trip finds theroux reflecting not only on changes to the landscape but also to himself a wonderful book infused with the insights of maturity its a reminder that in this age of increasingly homogenous urban centers and easy air travel those who really want to discern national differences should stay on the ground
1173808 brilliant no one writes with therouxs head on intensity and raptness and his descriptions made me want to jump on the next plane to istanbul and also of course to many of the other places he evokes i particularly loved the spectral motif the ghosts and shadows and underground presences that flit through the narrative giving the whole a half seen and haunting dimension that no book of travels ive ever read conjures up
1173809 i was in the pentagon on 9 11 and in its aftermath i witnessed the most remarkable and chilling attempt to consolidate and abuse executive power circumvent and ignore the rule of law and reverse engineer due process and the rules of evidence to deny our newest enemies a fair trial the challenge is the riveting and very inside story of an unlikely coupling of two lawyers from two very different legal worlds one military and one academic who joined forces to restore our jurisprudential values jonathan mahler captures the essence of their personalities and the truly heroic battles that they fought in a way that is both informative and fascinating do not get too comfortable though this struggle of epic constitutional proportions continues and every american who holds freedom dear must be educated about the dangers of executive power run amok the challenge is the book that will anchor that education
1173810 this is the definitive work on an epic supreme court case and on the human beings behind the headlines
1173811 the challenge is a rare achievement a book as involving as it is important the characters real people powerfully sketched and the narrative gripping as a movie make jonathan mahlers book impossible to put down and yet beneath the turning pages theres a firm spine a profound meditation on what patriotism means and how durable our constitution is the classic american story upholding the rules meeting the standard at high personal cost this book has the great legal drama of an entertainment the charge the defender the filing in to the courtroom but it ends as an inspiration
1173812 out of a great supreme court case jonathan mahler has made a riveting story here are the guantanamo prisoner who challenged the president the lawyers the judges i could not stop reading
1173813 the challenge is the definitive insiders account of how a law professor and a military lawyer won a historic supreme court case against military commissions established by the commander in chief jonathan mahler tells this improbable but important story in a gripping accessible narrative that reveals both the promise and the limitations of judicial review in the age of terrorism
1173814 even now i struggle and its one day at a time

1174039 theres nothing that you can do with steroids that you couldnt do without them
1174040 they cant give you strength that you couldnt come by naturally among the elite shot putters it doesnt come down to whos doing steroids or not the big natural athlete is going to come through
1174041 if it just came down to something you got from a bottle whether there was testing or not somebody would be throwing 80 feet
1174042 under u s standards it is inconceivable that a sample to be used as evidence against an accused person would have gone through the process that mr barnes sample did and still constitute reliable evidence
1174043 the roids seem to give you that psychological crutch and i experience cramps and stuff with them i dont think theyre that great people who are using roids its to come up to a high level but once youre up there you dont need them anymore
1174044 i was just 19 at the olympics in 64 and we knew that steroids were out there that the eastern europeans were doing them
1174045 we used to use caffeine pills sometimes but they didnt help me at all it messed up my timing and my technique just getting things out of balance if caffeine can do that to you steroids probably could too maybe you get stronger in one way but slower somewhere else the emphasis at every level seems to be strength but its how you apply that strength and athletic ability i look at shot putters today and a lot of them dont look like great athletes stronger than i ever was but they had bellies on them paunches i dont see how that translates into good footwork good technique and speed randy barnes and brian oldfield were just tremendous athletes at indoor events brian used to beat nfl running backs in the 50 yards and he could high jump 6 6 at 280 pounds
1174046 the strength athlete has to have the ability to physically adapt
1174047 whether its the shot put olympic lifting or the worlds strongest man its a test of applied strength strength without speed or flexibility or technique or the need to compete isnt enough in any of the disciplines the shot put records are out there because those throwers were just amazing athletes brian revolutionized the event by bringing in the discus style spin to the shot put and broke the record by feet i always think his ability was untapped
1174048 i guess new generation talent went elsewhere for a long time
1174049 brian oldfield threw 75 feet in 1975 when no one else could throw 72 feet and no one would break that mark for 12 long years
1174050 i started mimicking oldfields technique in 1986 unfortunately many erroneously believed that oldfield was such a freakish talent that whatever he did couldnt possibly apply to their mortal selves they were never more wrong i trusted it and followed it without asking questions and the better i got the more i was able to understand what he was doing that made the spin technique work so well
1174051 the most amazing feat of strength i ever saw was alexeyev military pressing 500 pounds
1174052 he lifted what was necessary to win and then to break the record each time by a minimal amount just so he could collect a bonus each time
1174053 it might be that we never saw him test himself with the most he could have lifted
1174054 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
1174055 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
1174056 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
1174057 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
1174058 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

1174099 if youre bothered by skyrocketing food and energy prices wait until congress re introduces its environmentalist inspired climate security act so called cap and trade cap and trade is deceptively peddled as a free market solution to the yet to be settled issue of manmade climate change under its provisions companies would be able to emit greenhouse gases only if they had a government allowance the congressional budget office estimates that a 15 percent cut in emissions would raise the annual average households energy costs by 1 300 since energy is an input to everything we use we can expect everything to become more costly resulting in a reduction in economic growth theres a hateful side to cap and trade thats revealed by asking the question how will it be decided who received how much allowance to emit greenhouse gases congress could sell the allowances and or give them away to favorite constituents you can bet the rent money that a new army of lobbyists with special pleadings will descend on washington to lobby congress and you can be sure that campaign contributions and favoritism will play an important role in the decision of who received what amount of allowances much worse than that is the massive control government would have over our economy and our lives the thirst to wield massive control over our economy helps explain the near religious belief in manmade global warming and the attacks on scientists and others who offer contradictory evidence
1174100 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
1174101 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
1174102 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
1174103 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
1174104 appearances aside you are not a trout part 1 trout and uv vision
1174105 prostitutes haggled with drunken customers over prices endured special brothel taxes spent wages on bribing town officials and suffered from malnutrition tuberculosis botched abortions and alcoholism yet these ugly realities of prostitute life are conveniently and consistently elided in songs books historical landmarks plays and film
1174106 presents the harsh reality of life as a prostitute but also opens the narrative to allow these women to explore their sexuality the potential for love and the perils of sudden emancipation but never in a manner that unrealistically elides their past
1174107 consistently and successfully resist the strictures of patriarchy that surround them achieving autonomy self expression even in all its complexity happiness yet their advances teeter in the balance as george hearst and the modernity and civilization he embodies takes root in deadwood
1174108 the schoolmarm the mother the helpmate all are civilizing forces that threaten the individualistic self reliance of the frontier feminine forces domesticity monogamy thus pull men from their natural state in the wild into the suffocating domesticity of the home
1174109 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
1174110 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this age has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
1174111 for since in the wisdom of god the world through wisdom did not know god it pleased god through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe for jews request a sign and greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness but to those who are called both jews because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
1174112 the fool has said in his heart there is no god psalm 53 1
1174113 fools mock at sin but among the upright there is favor
1174114 a fool has no delight in understanding but in expressing his own heart
1174115 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because although they knew god they did not glorify him as god nor were thankful but became futile in their thoughts and their foolish hearts were darkened
1174116 the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools for like the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity
1174117 he who walks with wise men will be wise but the companion of fools will be destroyed
1174118 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he who heeds counsel is wise
1174119 in respect to the establishment of gods lordship in jesus christ on earth there is no place for us to remain neutral nonparticipants or merely spectators toward others and ourselves in protest and opposition to the unreconciled world and the reality of nothingness we are called to be living participants in the prophetic history of jesus christ human beings under the grace of reconciliation are free to live in contact solidarity and fellowship with god as well as with the reconciled world therefore we live as companions in the partnership of reconciliation as brothers and sisters in the fulfilled covenant of god human beings under the glad tidings of reconciliation can live and work in contact solidarity and fellowship both vertically and horizontally in fact it is impossible to have the attitude of an ostrich burying ones head in the sand this prophetic history of jesus christ can be depicted and understood eschatologically as the supratemporal transcendent future that has not yet arrived but has begun with jesus christ in other words a biblical and eschatological perspective tells us about the present irruption of gods future or the advent of the new human being here and now or the present passing of the old reality the disruptive truth of the new and true reality

1174300 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1174301 i think that the hardcore hard right conservative catholics overreach on this one
1174302 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1174303 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1174304 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1174305 for the participants it feels almost like being in a film
1174306 you dont have to know the city but you have to be organised
1174307 the whole hunt is actually just a mechanism to make a visual art show
1174308 thats the cheekiness of it im interested in using participation as a means of creation all the objects in the gallery will have a story
1174309 the camp guards aimed to disarm and disorientate and take away peoples right to ask questions
1174310 well run out an offense every day that doesnt have many weaknesses
1174311 were going to be paying for this for a long time
1174312 we have to remember that in the future we will want to keep before our children what this war was really like it is so easy to forget and then for the younger generation the heroism and the glamour remain while the dirt the hardships the horror of death and the sorrow fade somewhat from their consciousness
1174313 oh dearest god in the heavens smite down the other side mainly because theyre not us
1174314 educated the group on the symptoms perceptions and impacts of ptsd on the soldier and his or her family
1174315 home sweet home after deployment what support for returning veterans and families here the third weeks session will let veterans discuss their own experiences with ptsd my buddy wounded times
1174316 you take the two best women to play the sport and put them together and well it doesnt exactly stink
1174317 you just dont see girls this fast and this quick and this tall
1174318 she can run in the sand as fast as any of the smaller girls
1174319 then you put misty the best defensive player in the world behind her misty is an absolute playmaker she gets to just about everything
1174320 over the course of an hour with kerri at the net and misty behind its a nightmare for these other teams
1174321 but theyre doing it to everybody theyre beating everybody theyre playing awesome volleyball
1174322 rachel and elaine had broken up so it made it a viable option
1174323 we had a heart to heart about it we said this is about us lets not let anyone get in our way if we decide to separate its going to be because of us
1174324 it wasnt like i hate you were not playing together there was never any of that it wasnt kerri and i saying we should split up it came from the outside but we put the blinders on and we moved past it
1174325 it was nothing against dane but we felt like we had kind of stopped growing
1174326 we thought maybe a new and fresh perspective would help
1174327 i dont know any other players who could hold up to the scrutiny and expectations that have been put on their shoulders
1174328 look at their two big streaks they won 89 straight matches and 15 tournaments in what was their most important year 2004 now theyre at 101 and 18 in what is now their most important year 2008
1174329 as kerri says when they lose people react like the world has come to an end
1174330 mistys very determined but youre not going to get a peep out of her im animated really loud i think thats what it takes she calms me down i pump her up
1174331 i know where shes going to be she knows where im going to be and in tight situations that experience can pull us through
1174332 i cant imagine we could make a better team playing with someone else
1174333 were going to be paying for this for a long time
1174334 then how do you feel about us americans visiting you here
1174335 that is why i am here but what about our veterans how do you feel about them returning they might have killed your people they might have even been here on that day
1174336 you must understand this often i think the only reason i survived with this pain is so that i could live to meet your veterans take their hands look into their eyes forgive them and help them forgive themselves and heal
1174337 when we come home either standing or dead to know you remember we fought and we bled is payment enough and with that we will trust that we mattered to you as you mattered to us
1174338 ted sexauer gave us instruction for finding the way to poetry he entitles the method
1174339 were going to be paying for this for a long time
1174340 when veterans of iraq and afghanistan bring their war troubles home police and judges are often the first to deal with them
1174341 suspect soldiers troubled histories follow some troops to iraq war
1174342 if there are better images of the strength and selflessness of the american soldier i cant think of any
1174343 this is the face of the war in iraq the mind behind it will never be the same
1174344 one thing that did seem to help ms knapp and ms minor said was peer counseling from a fellow veteran a man who had been ambushed in iraq and knew about fear and death but that was too little too late and both women say they are frustrated with the military for letting mr dwyer slip away
1174345 the mention of suicide is made in canto i of
1174346 this man has not yet seen his last evening but through his madness was so close to it that there was hardly time to turn about
1174347 life is a voyage on uncharted waters ending in shipwreck there are no survivors
1174348 is just one sample but after you read the shiloh piece its not hard to understand that what bierce and the others saw and experienced would have scarred them for life
1174349 close to home a soldiers guide to returning from war
1174350 used improperly ricin can be a very dangerous and deadly weapon
1174351 fortunately in this case the ricin is not believed to have caused any harm to the public

1174356 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue
1174357 were preparing for a category 2 though we believe it wont be that severe
1174358 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1174359 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1174360 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1174361 were advising residents to take care of their possessions that are susceptible when the tide comes over the bulkheads
1174362 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1174363 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1174364 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1174365 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1174366 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1174367 we dont want people hanging out in the first row intoxicated they put ourselves in danger and that puts our guys in danger
1174368 too fool your enimies you must first make a fool of your self
1174369 its quite unique four generations of the gibbs family who kept everything they really did keep everything
1174370 the interesting thing about it is the range of items from the 19th century objects to lord wraxalls 20th century washing machine
1174371 he lord wraxall was a soldier so perhaps he wanted it as a souvenir
1174372 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1174373 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1174374 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1174375 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1174376 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1174377 maybe god wants us to meet wrong people before we meet that only right one so when it will happen we will be thankful
1174378 it makes me extremely happy to be here this is the pride of the

1174383 were both fighting me as athlete to win a medal he as a lawyer for justice
1174384 used improperly ricin can be a very dangerous and deadly weapon
1174385 fortunately in this case the ricin is not believed to have caused any harm to the public
1174386 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1174387 if the seniors stay on edge and get better every day it will help everyone in camp
1174388 im really happy we brought him in hes is going to be great player here
1174389 i have known him forever he will be back when he is good and ready i know not being out here is killing him and we need him but we cant rush it

1174391 the south florida bulls are gearing up for a new season and the buzz might be at an all time high for the rising program
1174392 big east needs a coach to hang its helmet on
1174393 obama wants to raises taxes isnt that bad blah blah
1174394 now the voters of this district can benefit from a real conservation on issues
1174395 without my presence in the campaign the race would be merely a war of money and name recognition and pure partisanship
1174396 and at the end of the day the voters would end up with a typical run of the mill business as usual party hack this has to change and i can do it
1174397 failure of our immigration policy is not a new problem illegal immigration has been consistently ignored for at least two decades the resolution of our immigration crisis must begin with the securing of our borders
1174398 its one thing to post fancy words on a website about illegal immigration
1174399 its quite another to stand tough when voting time comes in congress and i think in her heart of hearts kats will side with immigrants

1174416 its that terrible look of a body thats wasted away but not a skeleton
1174417 toms age is right for the part he is relatively unknown as a romantic lead and this is his chance to make the transition he has strikingly unusual good looks and could benefit from being a goodie rather a baddy
1174418 tom is british and we wanted a british male lead as emma the female lead sara paxton is an american he is sensitive and intelligent enough to do a sensitive and demanding role we are both excited and very pleased to have tom
1174419 so i asked her if she could see if she could break that barrier get her whole hand in with many girls we try but its usually unsuccessful a pleasant surprise to both of us she managed to get her whole hand in it turned into a very erotic fisting video that i never expected to happen on this shoot shot in a very erotic manner i got the best angles i could and she tried two different positions from what she told me afterwards that it wasnt too difficult in the end but it helped that she had all the orgasms before helping loosen her up for this she finishes up with some rough toy penetration
1174420 we have 40 years of forest service history that has been reversed in the last three months
1174421 now that plum creek is getting out of the timber business were kind of missing the loggers
1174422 a clear cut will grow back but a subdivision of trophy homes thats going to be that way forever
1174423 i wanted to own land out there because i was always very interested in the concept of restoration conservation
1174424 the fact that its almost become kind of a housing subdivision that isnt what i was looking for i guess i wish i had bought the whole thing up and then i wouldnt have to worry about it

1174449 we know long sprint races are won and lost in the curves so we looked at what he already does best and from there created the finest curve running shoes in the world the adidas lone star allows jeremy to push even better in the turn and provides him with even more physical confidence stability and efficiency
1174450 we received our air xp helmets from schutt in time for us to fit them on players for our first mini camp
1174451 the players that are using the air xp are very pleased with the comfort fit and performance of the helmet
1174452 ive been here 18 years and have never seen reaction to a helmet like this the nfl teams are eating it up as are the major college programs were sending them out the door as fast we can make them
1174453 weve had very good success pre selling the air xp

1174467 the fact is most moms can meet all of a childs nutritional needs until 6 months when solid foods are gradually added to the diet
1174468 and no matter what else theyre eating kids as old as 2 can benefit from the antibodies and fatty acids in mothers milk
1174469 i try not to keep the house clogged up with things here and there i dont believe its good
1174470 i keep a small flat basket at hand to carry items back and forth so instead of making half a dozen trips i make two

1174474 we are a giant solar collecting system we get the bulk of our energy from the sunshine
1174475 a pond has a limited amount of surface area for solar absorption
1174476 by going vertical you can get a lot more surface area to expose cells to the sunlight it keeps the algae hanging in the sunlight just long enough to pick up the solar energy they need to produce to go through photosynthesis

1174485 if we lose the reefs you lose a very significant and important habitat
1174486 theres no question that man made actions are the major cause for these losses and stresses on the reefs

1174521 matt forte since day 1 since the first practice stood out
1174522 we took a running back as you all know we like him very much again we did a lot of work on him he played his whole career through his senior year we really want to focus on that we wanted players with good production and obviously we targeted certain positions that we either wanted to upgrade at and or create more competition forte would fall into the later we want to create more competition at the position i felt like our running game obviously was one of the weak spots on our football team he gives us a big back a three down back he has enough speed to get to the outside and he has the ability to make people miss at the second level those were two areas where we could really never find any consistency which made us an easy team to defend from my perspective he has very very good hands and hes a three down back i think he weighed in at 217 pounds at the combine he ran a really good forty i dont necessarily see the play speed on tape as what he ran at the 40 but he did run a very good forty at indianapolis

1174542 the new gtr offers enthusiasts everything theyre looking for in a sports car performance great looks and guaranteed exclusivity

1174554 poor little britney spears and lindsay lohan aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi i kinda feel sorry for them we should give those two a break
1174555 it is the formal and voluntary dismemberment of the republic

1174557 if what they are thinking of doing is to change the 1987 constitution in order to shift the philippine state from its current unitary system albeit recognizing local autonomy to a federal state system with local states then they are putting the cart before the horse they should do this before negotiating on a federal framework for the peace process otherwise they open themselves to the charge of treason based on the dismemberment of the philippine state and to accusation of acceding to an agreement in bad faith when they do not have the constitutional mandate for their negotiating position and their signature on the eventual agreement
1174558 i shaved it as soon as i came out of the game
1174559 we were losing when they hit that grand slam and then we came back and won
1174560 in about a week it will be back it goes hand and hand with winning
1174561 i would have kept it if we were winning that game

1174567 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect

1174570 engineers and insurers have to take a close look at it and theyre obviously waiting for the slip to stabilise before they go in
1174571 yesterday we went in and attached a temporary stormwater connection to the house because that was broken in the slip
1174572 however we will continue to watch them carefully over the coming week because there is more heavy rain forecast on thursday
1174573 my house has been here over 100 years there has been no movement so we dont feel unsafe at all
1174574 i was quite shocked to see it i didnt expect the whole wall to come down

1174576 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1174577 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other
1174578 it is a good sign that he will be staying because it took him a while i am happy that he has committed his future to arsenal
1174579 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game and then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to say
1174580 hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and can slowly build it up if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum
1174581 i think any of the top four can win the title
1174582 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1174583 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1174584 if senator mccain is willing to pass a compromise that provides immediate relief to consumers in the form of a 1 000 energy rebate and makes a serious investment in renewable energy senator obama would be happy to join him in calling on congress to return
1174585 but if he continues to reject any compromise that takes away tax breaks for the same oil companies that have given millions to his campaign wed rather not waste the american peoples tax dollars
1174586 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1174587 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1174588 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1174590 lalcol viene utilizzato per migliorare la comunicazione interpersonale spiega nicola caporaso professore ordinario di gastroenterologia delluniversit federico ii di napoli se bere alcolici utilizzato per superare difficolt relazionali diventa un bere problematico e si ricorrer allalcol ogni volta che si avranno difficolt in pratica dipendenza lanalisi delliss dice che 3 ragazzi su 4 tra 16 e 25 anni bevono alcolici e se si abbassa let a 15 anni un anno in meno del limite di legge per poterli acquistare i dati non cambiano beve il 67 il problema oltre che sociale anche medico negli adolescenti lalcol viene metabolizzato con maggiore difficolt e i danni al fegato ed al sistema nervoso sono maggiori che negli adulti cos si facilita linsorgenza di malattie del fegato come la steatosi o fegato grasso e la steatoepatite che nel corso degli anni possono trasformarsi in cirrosi ed epatocarcinoma
1174591 i giovani per non si accontentano di vino o birra preferiscono i drink a base di superalcolici ma devono capire che il loro un errore gravissimo che pu preludere alla dipendenza superare la soglia indicata dalloms chiarisce il professor caporaso aumenta la probabilit di contrarre un danno epatico indipendentemente dalle bevande che si assumono siano esse vino birra o superalcolici i dati sono preoccupanti il 7 dei giovani fa abuso di alcol almeno una volta la settimana e il primo approccio alle bevande alcoliche si abbassato a 10 11 anni importante anche non sottovalutare altri elementi come lo stile di vita nel suo complesso abitudini alimentari attivit fisica ecc e le modalit con cui ci si avvicina allalcol bevute quotidiane e lontane dai pasti fumo e malnutrizione sono fattori altrettanto importanti nel determinismo del danno epatico
1174592 stato accertato continua nicola caporaso che un consumo superiore agli ottanta grammi al giorno per dieci anni aumenta di cinque volte il rischio di cancro del fegato
1174593 ma afferma ancora il professor caporaso occorre tener conto per determinare linduzione e la progressione del danno epatico correlato allalcol anche dellassetto genetico del soggetto esistono geni che regolano la sintesi degli enzimi deputati alla neutralizzazione dei metabolici tossici dellalcol e dei cosiddetti mediatori del danno quali ad esempio le citochine

1174601 rome why would anyone want to go there its crowded dirty and full of italians youre crazy to go to rome so how are you getting there
1174602 thats a terrible airline their planes are old their flight attendants are rude and theyre always late so where are you staying in rome
1174603 that dump thats the worst hotel in the city the rooms are small the service is surly and theyre overpriced so what cha doing when you get there
1174604 were going to go to see the vatican and we hope to see the pope
1174605 you and a million other people trying to see him hell look the size of an ant boy good luck on this lousy trip of yours youre going to need it
1174606 not only were we on time in one of twas brand new planes but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class the food and wine were wonderful and i had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot and the hotel it was great theyd just finished a 25 million remodeling job and now its the finest hotel in the city they too were overbooked so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge
1174607 actually we were quite lucky for as we toured the vatican a swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors and if id be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me sure enough five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand i knelt down and he spoke to me
1174608 all of your lives may be spared if you can find ten of one fruit and bring them back to me
1174609 why did you start laughing you only needed one more grape and youd have gotten away
1174610 i couldnt help it i saw the third guy walking in with pineapples
1174611 if you look closely youll see that the fly has been circumcised
1174612 before i let you in i need you to tell me how your day was going when you died
1174613 i came home to my 25th floor apartment on my lunch hour and caught my wife having an affair but her lover was nowhere in sight i immediately began searching for him my wife was half naked and yelling at me as i searched the entire apartment just as i was about to give up i happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips the nerve of that guy well i ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground but wouldnt you know it he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didnt die this ticked me off even more in a rage i went back inside to get the first heavy thing i could get my hands on to throw at him oddly enough the first thing i thought of was the refrigerator i unplugged it pushed it out onto the balcony and tipped it over the side it plummeted 25 stories and crushed him the excitement of the moment was so great that i had a heart attack and died almost instantly
1174614 mr trump before i can let you in i need to hear about what your day was like when you died
1174615 no problem but youre not going to believe this i was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises i had been under a lot of pressure so i was really pushing hard to relieve my stress i guess i got a little carried away slipped and accidentally fell over the side luckily i was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine but all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment starts cussing and stomps on my fingers well of course i fell i hit some trees and bushes at the bottom which broke my fall so i didnt die right away as im laying there face up on the ground unable to move and in excruciating pain i see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony it falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me killing me instantly
1174616 mr president please tell me what it was like the day you died
1174617 i try to balance the meals by having meat and vegetables
1174618 i realise this is a less economical method of budgeting for groceries but it is hard to plan ahead when we need to allocate money for utilities and miscellaneous expenses
1174619 with this the students can be the eyes and ears of the police by passing us information on criminal activities
1174620 they can also give us details of offences prevalent among youth such as truancy loitering drugs and glue sniffing
1174621 this will ensure students can study in a safe and conducive manner
1174622 diamond isnt for everyone and may not even be for
1174623 we have worked for several years to find a better way of allowing families to keep their own income
1174624 we opted to retain the existing structure because we were not willing to create uncertainty for families under pressure if we are elected we will work to improve the system for families without reducing entitlements
1174625 my repeated responses to this question reflected my determination not to widen the debate not an attempt to criticise john key
1174626 i should have made it clear that i meant no criticism and im making that clear today
1174627 they may wrap the thing up in blankets but it doesnt put it to bed
1174628 i think mr english sees himself as the one the who drives the policy and he sees mr key as just the front man the one who goes around the country smiling nicely and saying nice things that people want to hear
1174629 i think this formulae which they repeat like a mantra that there would be no sales in the first term is simply a code for of course we have discussed these things we think it is very hard to get elected when you say you will state owned assets
1174630 it does raise serious doubts about where they really come from the issue here is not what do you say before an election but when the pressure comes on when the crunch comes on where are your gut instincts and i think mr english has made it clear where their gut instincts are
1174631 labour just doesnt understand that people want all the services and big tax cuts
1174632 labour just doesnt understand that people want all the services and big tax cuts
1174633 everyone just beware you never know what will put you in the limelight thanks to our media
1174634 i respect his decision i am sure he has given serious thought to it
1174635 he wants to be a team player and does not want to disrupt the leadership and transition plan announced by the prime minister
1174636 as such i feel it is appropriate for me to defend my post of vice president so that i can facilitate the transfer of power
1174637 we must always challenge and stretch ourselves and never be afraid of coming out with new ideas and approaches
1174638 world class public service delivery can only be achieved through a high level of inter agency collaboration
1174639 today citizens expect to be consulted as part and parcel of the policy making process this is in line with the concept of good governance which espouses the need to understand and engage the public and stakeholders for the good of society
1174640 more needs to be done to move the public service with the times
1174641 this should be an eye opener for others who could emulate the efforts by the state education department to ensure students develop a love for words
1174642 i save time and fuel by buying most of my food items here
1174643 however i buy items like meat and fish in small quantities as i do not like to keep them in the freezer for long
1174644 i want my family to eat fresh meat and fish which are good for their health
1174645 we have been to tesco previously and i want to compare the prices many people say the goods sold here are much cheaper
1174646 the items are for them to attend quran classes awaluddins old songkok has seen better days while his brothers quran is torn
1174647 vertice deludente mentre nei paesi poveri si muore di fame i grandi della terra commissionano lennesimo studio

1174650 all security and enforcement agencies are ready as far as logistics and manpower are concerned
1174651 for now we will deal with the large presence of illegal immigrants in sabah first
1174652 i give my assurance to human rights observers that we will meet the basic needs of detainees and avoid using forceful tactics unless necessary at the same time we will be stern in upholding the laws of the country
1174653 this would enable the employers to get proper documents for their workers while the operation is being carried out and at the same time their businesses would not be jeopardised
1174654 compare that with about 1 4 million hectares of land utilised in the industry surely the number of workers would be bigger
1174655 i see this event as a demonstration of our gratitude to the nation for the prevailing peace and harmony
1174656 some contract factories could have failed to look after their workers welfare but our factory has always complied with local immigration and labour laws in employing and managing foreign workers
1174657 the 1 000 foreign workers from various countries including vietnam and myanmar have had no problems and many have worked with us for between eight and 10 years
1174658 they must have been shocked to see the workers hostel with stoves pots and pans lying about in their living area and walls plastered with pin ups of the workers favourite stars according to the workers lifestyle back home
1174659 when the investigators were there the workers were probably grouped together and engaged in some recreational activity this gave the impression that they were living in a congested area
1174660 there is a need for the government to come up with a clear labour policy that does not differentiate local and foreign workers
1174661 the government should directly recruit the workers on a government to government basis and do away with recruitment agents
1174662 however if this is not seriously looked into then the future generation will lose out
1174663 this means that pahang is still covered by forest canopy from the coastal sea side and river mouths right up to its highlands
1174664 dealing with conflict of interest and corruption in small states the case of maldives
1174665 parlia ment and civil society engagement for better policy making
1174666 resolution and mechanisms to ensure adequate recognition of womens issues in budgetary processes
1174667 it is not proper for educationists to treat their students differently according to their race and to speak to them in such a manner
1174668 this is unfair because these are candidates who are alive but have been denied the right to stand in the elections whereas in june there was a candidate who was dead but was allowed to stand
1174669 i never imagined that my firstborn would have such health problems
1174670 the logs also had no references no cover letter bearing the letterhead of telecommunication centres like celcom and maxis letter head and they were not signed by the general manager
1174671 therefore we submit that these documents were not authentic unreliable and should be rejected
1174672 there were also 117 discrepancies between the logs a number too many for the court to accept any explanation for the differences
1174673 there was also upgrading in celcoms network and that the values of the cell identification and location area code changed constantly
1174674 there was also no standard operating procedure in changing the information on the documents and that it was not supervised by the head of department
1174675 this caused a guessing game about where the correct values for both the data should be there was also missing data in the logs which could have exonerated my client
1174676 the banks have agreed to restructure existing housing loans following a new finance ministry policy
1174677 the repayment period is being extended up to 45 years from the present 20 year term age limit of borrowers has also been increased by a maximum of 10 years from the previous cap at 65
1174678 restructuring existing loans and extending the repayment would reduce the quantum of monthly repayment thus providing extra cash in terms of disposable income
1174679 im sure this would lift the burden of the rakyat though theyll have to service the loan for a longer period of time
1174680 there is no official or standard policy on this as yet
1174681 such an arrangement also eases financial pressure on the principal borrower while ensuring the continuity of the loan
1174682 so there wont be any problem if the repayment is extended up to 45 years
1174683 this is more of a social decision than a business one as the motivation is to ease house buyers burden
1174684 senior citizens are eligible for loans in places like united kingdom and hong kong if they are creditworthy and enjoy a good quality of life i dont see any reason why they should be denied a housing loan
1174685 this policy review will also rejuvenate the housing industry in general as more people could afford to buy houses
1174686 we pay more when we buy just a few thousand tonnes or units of a particular material but these big players are able to get the same materials at much cheaper costs because they buy in bulk
1174687 also at times we are forced to wait for months as producers are often not very interested in tiny sales
1174688 so we are of the opinion that it would be better if we buy what we require from these big players the prices could fluctuate but most importantly our supply would be assured

1174712 76 per cent of people believe global warming is now equal to or more serious a threat than islamic fundamentalism
1174713 it happened without warning with no prior notice at all
1174714 we had no idea about it and it was sudden and unexpected obviously i am very disappointed but we will fight back from here
1174715 the confidence is there i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race
1174716 we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
1174717 i am sure it is not a great feeling when things looked already finished with only two laps to go and then you just hear something and have a strange feeling in the car as the engine breaks down for sure it is not a great feeling
1174718 i feel really bad and not happy for what has happened
1174719 we did a perfect job today sunday and then we just gave it away because two laps to go is not really a fantastic feeling i feel very bad but unfortunately this is part of our sport
1174720 now we need to think forward and we need to think about the next race we have a little bit of a break now which will be good to prepare our energy for the last seven races
1174721 well i think my race was done on the start
1174722 the start was the only place where we could have passed lewis hamilton and had the opportunity to win the race so that is why i took a lot of risk
1174723 it is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the greatest athletes from all over the world competing for honours
1174724 i will use the opportunity to study the new techniques and facilities used by the athletes and on my return will introduce such techniques in malaysia
1174725 we have tried to draw the attention of the public to fraudulent tickets
1174726 very supportive of any investigation into cases of fraudulent tickets or any illegal activities related to the sale of tickets
1174727 weve got to wait to see what will happen in the transfer market with regard to signing a new striker but what wayne did last season was staggering
1174728 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
1174729 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team
1174730 i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front maybe that will happen if we sign a striker and then youll see how dangerous he can be
1174731 we havent been able to train properly we have been training on an open field with no nets or changing rooms and the pitch is very uneven
1174732 everybody demands professionalism but the preparation is like for a kampung team
1174733 to have got this far despite some players and coaches being four months behind in salary is a miracle its also a great credit to the character and quality of the players
1174734 our first target is still to better the national record of 45 511s which was set almost 10 months ago in doing that we will raise our hopes of making the top eight that proceed to the knockout rounds
1174735 weve been fast in training but i would imagine josiah and myself were doing something around 13 seconds in our legs while azizul was around 16 or 17 seconds from the standing start
1174736 im there to do my best ever final lap everything ive done before doesnt matter weve nailed it into our psych that we arent just going to beijing because we qualified
1174737 were going there because we have a target of delivering medals for the country were going to ride to the death for that
1174738 i injured my groin a week before the malaysian open i had a lot of physio treatment and ultra sound and that made it better for a while but i guess that during the malaysian open last week the tissues must have got damaged even more
1174739 i thought i was going to be fine the idea was to get on court test it and see how it was going and see if i could play or not
1174740 but when i heard shabana had retired i knew i had to give something to the crowd and decided to play but i just couldnt do anything i just couldnt move
1174741 we try to improve the squad every year we try to reduce the gap we try to be closer and we want to win every trophy
1174742 we are improving the squad every year we are trying to be contenders in the premier league we are trying to progress in the champions league and in other competitions
1174743 i was surprised when people were talking about us not having won anything in the last two years but to finish third or fourth in the premier league and to reach the final and the semi final in the champions league i think its good its important
1174744 we want medals and trophies but were talking about united and chelsea playing in the final of the champions league and theyre at the top of the premier league so this is maybe the most difficult league but we will try to improve again
1174745 competing in the olympics itself is great but i cannot be contented with that if im just going for the sake of competing i might as well dont make the trip it may be difficult but im setting myself a medal target
1174746 the olympics is the highest achievement for any athlete and there are so many good shuttlers this time however all i need to do is win the first three rounds and that will put me in the semi finals things will be different after that and everyone will have an equal chance
1174747 however it is easier said than done but i have to think big and the pressure has been unbearable at times
1174748 however the coach misbun and my mental trainer fred tan have been helping me to be relaxed it is better that im under pressure now rather than suffering a collapse during the tournament
1174749 i have given them a month to complete their proposal and i will also request from the malaysian hockey federation mhf its current programmes for review
1174750 however i must stress that its an indirect involvement of the ministry as we are not suppose to interfere with nsas programmes
1174751 we chose to get involved in this matter as we are also really concerned with the current state of hockey
1174752 we were once no 4 ranked in the world and now we could fall further down the ranking after the beijing olympic games this is totally unacceptable
1174753 the 102 players are genuinely concerned with the current state and pro active measures should be taken to improve hockey
1174754 i also want them to present their proposal and from there we will compare the federations and the players proposals a special committee involving the ministry national sports council mhf and former players could be set up for this purpose
1174755 however it was all talk and i told them to put their ideas in writing
1174756 however like any other association we have a council and any new proposal must be presented within the council
1174757 yes its a good move in terms of local players having more chances to play in the league however its too early to say whether standard will improve
1174758 badminton is again our best hope of finally winning an olympic gold medal and the players must compete without fear especially against chinas shuttlers to ensure success
1174759 there will be intimidation but if our shuttlers can go on court fully focused on each match a gold medal could be assured
1174760 most of our shuttlers have beaten chinas players before and i see no reason for them not doing it again
1174761 lee chong wei has defeated world no 1 lin dan several times and he can do it again provided hes focused throughout
1174762 however the shuttlers must avoid unnecessary publicity in beijing to remain focused for their big day
1174763 chong wei mew choo and kien keat boon heong will definitely be the focus of their local reporters and they should avoid revealing too much on their form
1174764 ive heard that several beijing based reporters have requested interviews and that could interrupt the players preparations
1174765 we would have been very surprised if the judge had let down his president sepp blatter
1174766 i dont know how it will turn out but we have succeeded in getting a ruling from the highest sport court
1174767 we have succeeded in not giving in to the political statements of blatter
1174768 the loser is the clubs because we pay the players but dont get anything from them
1174769 no the loser is actually the people from fifa because they have shown themselves to be incapable in this whole affair
1174770 the continued growth of professional golf will see the asian tour hitting a new record in terms of tournaments played and prize money offered
1174771 during the practice round in thailand i found it really tough and i was trying to keep the ball in play
1174772 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1174773 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1174774 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1174775 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
1174776 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1174777 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
1174778 the answer to the second question according to the congressional research service crs is that the 1980s windfall profits tax depressed the domestic production and extraction industry and furthered our dependence on foreign sources of oil
1174779 yeah but hes going to use that money to give us a rebate
1174780 weve never had more potential i dont believe as a sporting nation than we have this year
1174781 i was disappointed with their juniors lack of discipline in this match and gave them a stern warning not to argue with umpires anymore
1174782 i will not hesitate to show the door to any player who is more interested in arguing than playing
1174783 we are not here to win the tournament i am more interested to see how they perform as an attacking outfit
1174784 and after the tournament i will work on their fitness i am confident they will turn into better players
1174785 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1174786 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1174787 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1174788 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1174789 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1174790 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1174791 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1174792 se condene al que tiene una adicci n como si fuera un criminal
1174793 que lo hizo sin darse cuenta y sin atribuirle ning n valor
1174794 theyre always a winning team and theyre always in the playoffs
1174795 youre talking about a hall of fame catcher we were able to acquire
1174796 its a big transition but we thought he could do it
1174797 it happens in baseball you have to be ready for anything
1174798 he stops the running game he brings a winning attitude
1174799 hes been catching a long time he brings a lot of knowledge
1174800 it is do with national pride it does become the first gold medal of the games
1174801 for every games there is that sense that we are presenting the nation to the world and that really has been probably since 1980 when the games started to become a big television deal
1174802 any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1174803 the purpose of hosting the olympics is to prove to the chinese people that the rest of the world acknowledges the chinese communist party as legitimate leaders
1174804 i dont know the whole answer yet but it didnt seem like it would be anything serious
1174805 theyve done what everyone else in this room wants to do
1174806 i still have a lot of ways where i think i can improve
1174807 i feel leaner and faster coming into this season but well see if i still feel that way after training camp
1174808 im very proud of what america represents to the world but this is a basketball game not life or death olympic sports should be about unity friendships and bringing the best athletes on the planet together
1174809 i just play basketball as a russian so nothing has really changed in my life outside of just playing basketball as a russian
1174810 my parents were the big concern i didnt want them thinking their son is a traitor
1174811 i felt i was missing something is the only thing i had in my life
1174812 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1174813 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1174814 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1174815 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1174816 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1174817 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1174818 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1174819 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1174820 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1174821 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1174822 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1174823 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1174824 in the last four years there have been a lot of experiences for me outside of judo which have expanded my potential
1174825 its like meeting your first love again after eight years apart
1174826 she pushes and pushes and then at the end she stings
1174827 it is because she is so key to the teams morale
1174828 this is my fifth olympics and every competition i want to do my best for all the fans
1174829 i actually walked the bike about three quarters of the way down then i jumped on the bike and hit a rock
1174830 the tire popped and i went over the handlebars and absolutely shredded my shoulder
1174831 couldnt hit a backhand until 14 days ago it was incredibly frustrating
1174832 in the morning we work on the physical elements and do some work in the gym then we are into the water we grab some lunch and then get back in the water until 7 or 8 at night until everything is perfect or near perfect
1174833 i was the sort of child that you always had to drag out of the water
1174834 when they did get me out my lips were purple and my skin like a prune
1174835 i have always found it easy to move in the water and when i am not in it for two or three days my bones hurt i need to be in the water all the time
1174836 we cant wait to get started as you always get a bit anxious in the run up to big events
1174837 physically we are in good form so now we need to rest a bit but im confident that we will swim very well when we get there
1174838 i think we have been training hard we have changed a few things in the choreography and the coach is very happy with what weve been doing i think we can do very well
1174839 in beijing the objective is to get amongst the medals and get as near as possible to perfection and the gold
1174840 at the moment we think that are the strongest team and we need to get as near as possible to them united states will be somewhere thereabouts too
1174841 bronze might be a bit disappointing even though i have never won a medal before silver would be great and if we won gold it would be a dream come true
1174842 if the russians make mistakes and we do the best possible we could win but the silver is the most realistic option

1174861 i think this is my third or fourth time with an opportunity to play on the ryder cup team and i havent quite gotten it done
1174862 i want to play well and i want to be a part of that team
1174863 i really want to make it on my own merit
1174864 ive been playing a little bit better of late and my game is starting to come around
1174865 i havent been driving it as well as i was last year but i continue to work on it

1174881 one of the real benefits out of this particular roof is that it reduces the heat load that this particular building experiences
1174882 it reduces the amount of heat that our equipment has on the roof it reduces the load that is inside the building and it ultimately allow us to reduce our energy consumption in the building and that pays off in dollars

1174887 i immediately thought in relation to this farcical sort of situation of the appropriateness of the words of gilbert amp sullivan in referring in another context to another body which did nothing in particular and did it very well in these circumstances the strictures made by the solicitor general on the directors both elected and appointed are certainly not without justification and i can only put a charitable gloss on those aspects of their evidence where the activities and practices indulged in reflect on their own inertia by saying perhaps they loved the truth so well they used it sparingly
1174888 i do actually have those symptoms how did you know that
1174889 i wont say that i am leaping to another genre as r amp b and hip hop arguably have their roots in jazz
1174890 this is a turning point in my life i have found my sound and my soul this is me and i am comfortable with what i am pursuing
1174891 it is hard to be an independent artiste because you have to finance your own album and seek distributors you have to organise everything yourself it is tough but i have my say and control over my music direction
1174892 hip hop jazz isnt so appealing to the masses for my debut album i want to show people the real performer that i am and i am taking the risk by producing an album that defies the mainstream market
1174893 my lyrics represent my beliefs and i hope my words are able to impact listeners i cant read musical notes and i only play basic guitar chords but i am determined to make my own sound
1174894 i havent met anyone who understands my sound thus i am my own songwriter arranger and producer i have the final say at the end of the day

1174923 both parties have quite unacceptable policies in terms of the industrialisation of darwin harbour and other issues such as strongly backing uranium mining and theres all sorts of problems with health and education funding that doesnt seem to be coming through
1174924 i really have a concern when we seem to be only focusing on the lower levels of education and certainly they make interesting media coverage to see the chief minister sitting down in a classroom reading stories to little children but it wouldve been nice to also see him talking to batchelor students or graduates out in the field
1174925 as the member for arafura and minister for environment and heritage she has failed the tiwi people
1174926 she has failed the tiwi people in terms of advocating their concerns around the forestry project thats certainly my view
1174927 oakeshott has polled two thirds of the vote and won with a clear majority at the last two state elections as an independent and hed take that lead into the federal by election
1174928 his record as a state member stands and hes been able to achieve very little
1174929 if you analyse the figures of capital expenditure on the north coast he is the lowest electorate to receive capital expenditure and quite frankly his contributions in parliament are very quiet we rarely see him
1174930 as one of the main providers of community housing in canberra we welcome the ministers approach to regulatory frameworks and ensuring that they protect their own asset base but in turn we think that there couldve been a lot more consultation on the formulation of this bill and subsequent delivery

1174937 mahkota has been around for a while we were inactive due to unavoidable circumstances
1174938 we were active before our documents were lost when our secretary nd lala lost his car a few years back
1174939 we decided to reform the society and pledged to be a proactive force within the industry a new mission leads to a new name hence the name mahkota
1174940 there are many problems in the entertainment industry members are restless with the dilemma faced by the industry
1174941 commercial dance companies and conventional theatre are not under the same banner both are having difficulties when it comes to their rights the congress will discuss these issues and come up with solutions
1174942 music is not well governed by an official organisation the film industry has finas to cater to its needs who caters to the people in the music business these are some issues that we will debate in the congress
1174943 we have a lot of associations out there but we are lacking in unity mahkota will initiate the first step to bring us together in an event that can change the fate of the industry
1174944 twelve papers will be presented and debated at the event towards the end of the day we will reach a resolution that will be presented to the minister of unity culture arts and heritage
1174945 we will have presenters and speakers who are well versed with the given subjects they consist of academicians entertainment writers specialists and activists
1174946 we want ideas and suggestions from participants we suggest participating associations and ministries send creative and outspoken participants to the event
1174947 many diseases and defects due to injury will result in either loss or damaged cells in the tissue or organ which will eventually lead to tissue or organ dysfunction with the tissue engineering technology damaged tissues or organs can be repaired
1174948 we have been successful with tissue engineering on cartilage skin bone cornea and trachea except for the cornea the rest have been tested successfully in pre clinical trials once we get the approval and grant we will proceed to test these on humans
1174949 we have successfully built an ear cartilage tissue but there is a problem with the blood flow around the middle of the lobe so we are still working on it once we get it done we will start on pre clinical trials
1174950 as for the knee joint we have tested on a sheep and it has shown excellent results clinical trials will start soon
1174951 the engineered trachea was tested on a sheep and was able to function as a normal tissue we are very excited with the success and cannot wait to start the clinical trials
1174952 though tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may be relatively new here but the work done by the researchers is outstanding once we have done the clinical trials we can have the products commercialised we can use it locally or even sell it to other countries
1174953 we have limited funds as the cost of a gmp lab is rm30 million this has created a bottleneck as we cant implement research findings which have been successfully tested in pre clinical trials
1174954 we are getting funds from the government perhaps the government should encourage foreign pharmaceutical companies which are selling their products here to assist in providing grants for the research
1174955 wow that was really cool and now im all happy

1175214 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1175215 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

1175257 nick played very very good hes close to nba standards and he could get a call up to the association if he sticks around
1175258 the specific areas of nicks game where i saw improvement were his confidence maturity and overall realization of how close he is his strong finish to the season in bakersfield really propelled him into the summer
1175259 its going to be a very important season for not only the jam but the league itself the addition of two new teams the amount of players who had an impact on the nba playoffs the amount of quality players in the summer leagues and the coaching movement to and from both leagues all of these story lines help set the stage for a superb 2008 09 season

1175280 the only major change the past five years has been the addition of two boilers to produce steam heat this became necessary when the city of fergus falls ended its garbage burning at the rtc
1175281 everything is on one level here and that makes a big difference compared to previous years at the courthouse
1175282 sure we have long hallways here but at the same time ample parking is close by and there are no stairs to climb or elevators to wait for the elderly and others who need assistance can make use of a battery operated cart or wheelchair if they so desire
1175283 looking back im pleased that we did things the way we did
1175284 the state gifted the geriatrics care center to us otter tail county and we were able to not only reuse the structure but to preserve it over the past five years weve succeeded in providing better service to county residents
1175285 the addition of the as we change brand to blyth will complement our existing direct to consumer portfolio while enhancing our market share within the catalog and internet space
1175286 moreover it fits squarely with our strategy to seek attractively priced acquisitions that can leverage our existing industry expertise and geographic footprint

1175291 did the vikings speak to favre before it was allowed
1175292 people that i talk to say losing these 50 to 60 foot tall trees that have provided shade to their homes for decades is a little like losing a family member
1175293 its a very difficult thing to watch to see a neighborhood just transformed but thats what happened in detroit
1175294 ash trees are survivors but the emerald ash borer is something entirely unto itself
1175295 its going to have a major impact on ash trees
1175296 the discovery of this highly destructive pest at a campground is a strong indication it probably arrived in firewood
1175297 if people knew how devastating this insect can be they would never consider bringing firewood in from out of state
1175298 we have found that humans spread emerald ash borer faster than anything else
1175299 they are capable of flying up to a quarter of a mile but thats not much when you consider the great distances theyre traveling
1175300 you could make it to 37 weeks no problem but it will be your blood pressure or an abnormal lab result that will probably make them come early
1175301 candilejas en la trastienda el rol del titiritero y su espacio de juego
1175302 las cosas y los hechos me fueron llevando a vincularme con los juegos tradicionales a lo largo de mi vida
1175303 hay que tener en cuenta que el lugar de un actor de teatro como de teatro de t teres convengamos que el titiritero es un actor que se expresa a trav s de objetos soporta la compleja tarea de interpretar entender y dar a entender una realidad determinada pero con la particularidad de estar inmerso simult neamente en m s de una realidad
1175304 creo que hay fidelidad en la transferencia del decir que nos hace parte del jugar cuando un actor es fiel a s mismo quiero decir con esto que somos fieles y con esto no quedamos al borde sino que somos parte de la magia cuando estamos convencidos de lo que hacemos cuando nos creemos lo que estamos haciendo cuando somos conscientes de que no se trata simplemente de un tr mite sino que cada vez que la acci n se repite vuelve a ser la primera y ltima vez la primera y ltima oportunidad de vivir a trav s de los personajes
1175305 pipo refleja en su personalidad lo que soy y lo que no pude ni puedo ser es decir que de todas formas soy a trav s de ese personaje yo lo imagino y l es en suma yo soy pipo
1175306 en la forma y en la funci n del juego que representa una cualidad aut noma encuentra el sentimiento de incardinaci n del hombre en el cosmos su expresi n primera m xima y sagrada va penetrando cada vez m s en el juego el significado de una acci n sagrada el culto se injerta en el juego que es lo primario
1175307 el teatro como toda manifestaci n art stica nos permite hurgar en los vericuetos del subconsciente de la humanidad para que miremos de frente al espejo que nos devuelve las im genes de nuestros fracasos errores y frustraciones con el fin de poder analizarlos extraer lo rescatable aprender a re rnos de nosotros mismos y con una esperanza renovada seguir adelante en una b squeda de la utop a si entendemos que los ni os son nuestra esperanza y que la utop a es el concepto que nos impulsa a seguir adelante en pos de un mundo mejor ese es entonces el ingrediente perfecto para construir fantas as encantadoras no para enga arlos sino para sugerirles que la felicidad es posible por un acto de buena voluntad
1175308 estoy convencido que jugando dando rienda suelta a la imaginaci n construiremos un mundo mejor
1175309 en la escuela el cuerpo es un problema que se controla enclaustr ndolo en salas cerradas y en tiempos restringidos sent ndolo en sillas que cansan y que da an as es dif cil que la escuela recupere el cuerpo l dico explorador de senderos ignotos y experimentador de novedades un cuerpo que es lugar y tiempo para ser y para estar que se vive como misterio que hay que disfrutar y no como problema que se debe soportar como un cuerpo complejo nico total sin rgico y no como un cuerpo complicado dividido en partes algunas de las cuales averg enzan y se teme ense ar
1175310 no s lo en la escuela sino tambi n en el hogar el cuerpo no fluye en especial en aquellos infantes que permanecen horas ante la televisi n por ejemplo comiendo comida basura y neg ndose el placer de jugar es lamentable que el hogar se transforme en un clon de la escuela ambas casa y escuela son v ctimas del mismo modelo paradigm tico que conduce a la inactividad y a la pasividad
1175311 qu buscan las mujeres aqu la mayor a quiere diversi n aislarse de lo cotidiano y olvidarse de los problemas muchas adem s nos piden que les ense emos a hacer estriptis para luego bailarles a sus parejas eso no les interesa a los hombres ellos quieren ser rom nticos con sus mujeres mientras que ellas quieren crear morbo
1175312 lo que resulta dif cil es encender a un grupo de mujeres que se encuentra apagado las mujeres son muy exigentes
1175313 lo m s dif cil es enfrentarse a las mujeres
1175314 lo m s dif cil de ser estr per es enfrentar al p blico hay dos extremos con los que se debe actuar cuando la mujer a la que le bailas es muy t mida y se queda totalmente est tica y cuando la chica por el contrario te salta encima y no te deja bailar muchas veces tuve que alejarlas y decir disculp pero tengo que terminar el show llegar a dominar el tubo tambi n es algo dif cil y hasta peligroso uno termina todo golpeado despu s de los ensayos cuando reci n se empieza hay muchas ca das
1175315 algunas necesitan que se las escuche porque los problemas delicados de casa no siempre se pueden contar a un conocido es una forma de desahogarse y como aqu los hombres no estamos en la misma posici n en la que estamos all afuera ac nos mostramos tal como somos aparecemos sin ropa no podemos hacernos los bellos entonces para ellas es m s f cil abrirse y decirnos lo que realmente piensan
1175316 a mi mam le informaron mal sobre lo que yo hago y pens que me estaba prostituyendo
1175317 si un estr per se cuida y es gil puede seguir hasta sus 30 35 o hasta 40 a os
1175318 en paraguay un estr per gana muy bien no necesita trabajar en nada m s y es bien reconocido como aqu los modelos
1175319 aqu todav a hay mucho machismo pero la mentalidad ya est cambiando
1175320 muchos no saben lo que hace un estr per en santa cruz todav a es tab cuando se abri madames la gente se resist a a venir porque lo relacionaban con un night club donde se busca otra cosa pero hemos crecido y ahora vienen mujeres de todas las edades estados civiles y clases sociales
1175321 las mujeres buscan pasar un buen rato con sus amigas y salir de la rutina juegan mucho se empujan entre s para que una de ellas salga a bailar con el estr per pero tambi n hay las muy reservadas por eso tenemos ambientes privados para que un grupo de hasta 10 mujeres disfrute del show sin exponerse
1175322 se debe entender que hay tres facetas en esto el estriptis que es una serie de insinuaciones er ticas a trav s de un baile en el que uno se quita la ropa sensualmente el desnudo completo que bien hecho es un arte y la prostituci n que implica la venta del cuerpo nosotros hacemos lo primero nicamente
1175323 i walked to the field like six times and all six times i was wrong bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad i was making the wrong decision every time i went to the field
1175324 bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad
1175325 i have an entire bullpen full of pitchers and none of them can pitch every pitcher i gave the ball to sucked today
1175326 our bullpen was pretty bad today theyre going to have to do better than that or were going to have to go find somebody else to pitch for us
1175327 did you go out of your way to phrase or intone what you said in a way that was calculated to cause more pain than the truth on its own would have caused
1175328 no es que est n gordos son simplemente personas saludables
1175329 no son descuidados en su apariencia son demasiado inteligentes para preocuparse de superficialidades
1175330 no es que huelan mal sino que son masculinos en demas a
1175331 no son tontos m s bien exageradamente buenos e inocentes
1175332 adem s est el eterno discurso materno que reza que ninguna mujer ser nunca suficientemente buena entonces ellos con la autoestima superhiperdesarrollada al tener la certeza de que no existe mujer que est a su altura buscan nom s sustituta de mami que les planche les cocine que les siga diciendo lo es pec ta cu la res que son y que por supuesto sea la perfecta sombra que jam s abra la boca para opacarlos y que los haga lucir siendo un accesorio monumental vestido a la ltima moda y que siempre parezca que est reci n salidita del sal n de belleza
1175333 cuando entr por primera vez a las pesas nunca imagin llegar a ser campeona las cosas se van dando de a poco por el esfuerzo y el sacrificio que uno le pone y es as como los logros van llegando
1175334 me gusta entrenar duro para progresar y cumplir mis metas
1175335 este deporte es literalmente pesado absorbente y requiere de muchos sacrificios
1175336 amo mi deporte siento satisfacci n al entrenar y llegar cansada a mi casa es un placer nico lograr tantas cosas
1175337 el motivo por el cual la apoyamos es la garra y el deseo de superaci n que tiene porque a pesar de los inconvenientes ella se ha esforzado y ha demostrado ser una persona integral tiene much simos m ritos

1175347 he was waiting for her at the end of dean lane at the end of the road he had the gun drawn and he fired my sister pushed her other girl my niece to the floor board out of harms way
1175348 then he walked up beside the truck and unloaded another gun into her
1175349 we are getting from our interviews that there was a stressed relationship between dorriety and his mother in law there had been some verbal confrontations in the past
1175350 he has made the comment that his intention was to kill mrs allison
1175351 it doesnt make it right but i have forgiven him i know my sister is in heaven shes not hurting shes not suffering shes with my mom my mom passed away a year ago but its hard
1175352 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
1175353 they deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job washington itself has been remade into a golden landscape of super wealthy suburbs and gleaming lobbyist headquarters the wages of government by entrepreneurship practiced so outrageously by figures such as jack abramoff it is no coincidence frank argues that the same politicians who guffaw at the idea of effective government have installed a regime in which incompetence is the rule nor will the country easily shake off the consequences of deliberate misgovernment through the usual election remedies obsessed with achieving a lasting victory conservatives have taken pains to enshrine the free market as the permanent creed of state
1175354 democrats for their part have tried to explain the flood of misgovernment as part of a
1175355 sees that banks are safe places for people to keep their money
1175356 that old dime was all about service about the things government could do for us but the new dime is about profit about the superiority of private enterprise about the huge sums that can be squeezed out of federal operations instead of symbolizing good government the dime now shows us the wrecking crew in full swing
1175357 there are huge corporations that make obscene profits from human misery they run our health care industry they run our oil and gas companies they run our bloated weapons industry they run wall street and the major investment firms they run our manufacturing firms they also ominously run our government
1175358 i guess it got too cold in canada so theyve moved south now to scam everyone in america theyre using reputable companies to get a leg in the door like publishers clearinghouse readers digest theyre using reputable companies that offer sweepstakes in the u s to weasel in
1175359 the first phone call i placed was answered cordially i was told that someone would get back to me i never heard back from anyone

1175384 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1175385 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1175386 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1175387 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1175388 as i said well make our decisions alans a contracted player
1175389 were not hiding anything we will take our time to consider our situation because theres nothing worse than making these decisions on the run unfortunately for us it has changed
1175390 the situation i think was that they were looking after alan after your paper slaughtered him last year
1175391 as a result of that thats compromised the decision making process during the day
1175392 they came to us and told us later that didak was in the car we are going to have a little bit of time to work through things and reconsider the situation
1175393 we have tried our best to be as honest as we can with everybody with the information that we had in front of us
1175394 and now that we have new evidence in front of us we will consider that and in the cool light of day and make a decision
1175395 it is time these guys grew up and took responsibility
1175396 weve had enough of these blokes letting us down theyre not five year olds now theyre grown men
1175397 coach mick malthouse breaks his neck week in and out and is dragged down by clowns enough is enough
1175398 he just gave us his details and was very co operative it was heath and alan didak in the car i wouldnt have guessed that they were over the limit
1175399 i recognised didak they said they swerved to avoid a possum he shaw did not look like he was really pissed
1175400 he wasnt near there but a short time after he was we were together then we went separate ways then i called him because i didnt really know what to do
1175401 the police have a statement about who was in the car the name of the person is a friend of heaths its not alan didak its no one associated with the club

1175419 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp
1175420 not only does the combination of these two great companies create immediate value for our stockholders it also enhances our ability to achieve our customers needs with our unwavering commitment to quality and innovation
1175421 telepresence is radically changing the face of business by removing distance as a barrier
1175422 our solutions are delivering bottom line benefits today by helping customers reduce costs shorten sales cycles improve customer retention and lower carbon emissions by providing an effective travel alternative
1175423 this lets customers avoid rip and replace while going after the benefits of dedupe with those arrays
1175424 with the v series until now the discussion has been focused on integrating other vendors storage
1175425 when you combine the efficiencies of storage virtualization new technologies to ease management and deduplication its an unbelievable value
1175426 we see a customer using standard fibre channel arrays who is looking to add capacity in reality doesnt really need to add instead he can pick up additional capacities with the v series
1175427 in many cases we see no performance hit and in rare cases performance goes up
1175428 but in most cases we let customers set their own performance threshold so that if the performance drops below that level the dedupe is turned off
1175429 we want to change this situation and flip it around
1175430 iscsi is inherently more virtualised than fibre channel allowing for more granular addressing especially important for virtual server environments
1175431 organisations dont know exactly how much storage they have they know where their big databases are but dont know how many pcs they have or what information is on them
1175432 fibre channel went from 2g to 4g and there are plans to offer 8g while ethernet is on 10 gigabits today and there are plans for 40
1175433 in future we will be able to move a virtual machine to storage with a better quality of service if necessary
1175434 youll be able to automatically move less frequently accessed data from 9 000 per terabyte storage to 3 000 per terabyte storage
1175435 apart from the biggest organisations most companies do not have dedicated staff to manage areas such as storage
1175436 tiered storage is going to happen but theres a desperate need for data discovery tools and automatic classification of data

1175601 there has been considerable research performed on both groups of chemokines and their role in the immune response and immune trafficking
1175602 the discovery of this basic phenomenon that these lymphoid chemokines are reduced during an immune response was quite a shock to us it illustrates another dramatic level of complexity in the immune system and demonstrates in greater detail how the traffic of immune cells is regulated
1175603 after considerable time and effort we regret that we cannot complete the tasks requested
1175604 unable to effectively analyze this or any other proposals for development of a commercial venture involving the hotel bentley
1175605 i think what the council was looking for was to allow the second century bentley as well as the mayor and whoever else wanted to provide information and allow the chamber to provide an outside party review but from my understanding we were the only ones that provided information to the chamber
1175606 the chamber wasnt in a position to truly make a recommendation because their role wasnt fully taken advantage of
1175607 the staff has never quit working on this the staff has not stopped talking to folks about it and compiling information and we are going to be prepared
1175608 i am still very confident that the council will move ahead on the bentley project
1175609 i have a friend i like like that and i don
1175610 a group of practitioners is losing an important skill it is like going to war with fewer weapons at your disposal
1175611 chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1175612 the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1175613 responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally orientated and threatening correspondence
1175614 supermarket trolley return is after all scarcely at the top of the employment pecking order
1175615 it is reasonable to suppose that those doing this work were desperate for employment
1175616 chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1175617 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1175618 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1175619 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1175620 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again
1175621 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised by who not a bureaucrat a senior doctor

1175639 oh my god i wish i could be more like him
1175640 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1175641 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1175642 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1175643 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1175644 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1175645 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1175653 whenever i met a challenged athlete on the course my own aches and pains went away

1175656 sometimes you dont know whos racing next to you and the impact they have on the world
1175657 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1175658 hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe they are in that condition which is called war and such a war as is of every man against every man in such condition there is no place for industry because the fruit thereof is uncertain and consequently no culture of the earth no navigation nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea no commodious building no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force no knowledge of the face of the earth no account of time no arts no letters no society and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death and the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish short

1175667 if theres a vote to go to war with iran ill vote no
1175668 then why did you vote for 400 million for covert activities in iran
1175669 but im very concerned about your resolution h con res 362
1175670 hes very unpopular so he wont win unless we attack them iran is a very ancient sophisticated culture they can take care of themselves we just need to leave them alone
1175671 iran is in compliance with the iaea and both the nie and the iaea have said there is no evidence that iran is developing a nuclear weapon
1175672 you dont need to do that just withdraw your resolution
1175673 if you can show me evidence that iran is allowing the iaea to do its inspection i will withdraw my resolution

1175685 the down time was pretty good for me and heading into next season i wanted to get that rest
1175686 i think i can speak for everybody when i say were pretty excited to get going here
1175687 the summer has gone pretty fast and were all looking forward to next year were ready for it
1175688 were all pretty excited about the acquisitions we made weve really improved and hopefully going into next season well be a better team for it
1175689 we might be a smaller team but i dont think we can be intimidated
1175690 the guys on our team have a lot of character and a lot of heart and if teams are trying to run us out of the rink were not gonna back down the way the game is called these days if you play undisciplined youre gonna be in the box all game and we just have to capitalize on the powerplay
1175691 we have a great core group of defensemen that can move the puck pretty well and our forwards have a lot of speed and a lot of offensive ability
1175692 i developed a great chemistry with them at the end of last season and i feel we really read off each other
1175693 but at the same time in order to be a valuable asset you gotta be a guy who can play with anybody we have 12 or 13 really good forwards and anybody can play with anybody
1175694 the start we had last year didnt do us any favours and if we can get off to a good start it will definitely help us we all know how important it is and we want to carry over the things that we were doing at the end of last season to the start of this season
1175695 you know what it was kind of a whirlwind year for me in the fact that i really didnt know what was gonna happen going into training camp
1175696 i just kinda rolled with every opportunity i got there were a lot of ups and downs during the season but i think as the season went along i learned a lot this was a huge development year
1175697 either you forget how hard you worked going into your first year and you take the summer off and the other thing is youre playing against tougher opposition for us we just gotta stay mentally strong throughout the year and rise to the challenge
1175698 were not gonna sneak under the radar as much as we did last year but theres nothing we can do about that
1175699 we drove by his house the other day and he wasnt around its a pretty nice house

1175735 please to all the fishos out there do not drop anchors on to these sites
1175736 some agencies probably potentially overreacted and the media latched onto that
1175737 theyre occupying a different niche than the largemouth bass and other fish
1175738 at this point we havent been able to detect any ill effects
1175739 to put it in context in 2004 when we started electro fishing it took four or five hours to find one snakehead
1175740 now in an hour we might catch 8 or 10
1175741 but were not under any illusions that were going to slow them down in addition to studying them we want to contain them
1175742 people interested in catching them want to eat them or theyre just latched onto the whole aura
1175743 for a freshwater fish the meat is very firm white and thick its quite tasty
1175744 it used to take us a week to make one traditional bubu fish trap as we would have to walk a day or two into the forest to find the material from trees
1175745 everyone in this village is interested even the women are trying their hand at making this new type of fish trap
1175746 made a living hunting and killing large whales by biting off their tails and flippers
1175747 it takes a lot of computing power to analyze something as relatively simple as a set of jaws since youre dealing with all sorts of complex shapes in biology
1175748 if its a relatively small target and if they are at all unsure what it is they may be biting into it might be a lump of bone or steel then its highly unlikely that youre going to see anything like their maximum bite force
1175749 its the biggest bite force known for any living animal so far although its certainly possible that the killer whale or possibly the larger crocodiles have more powerful bites
1175750 greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1175751 i have to say that i am pretty impressed with just how complex and sophisticated the feeding apparatus of the shark is
1175752 with all the mammalian predators ive looked at a lot of the muscle force going into the bite is actually lost the shark has a much more efficient lever system going on
1175753 these sharks go after large prey that can hurt them and theyd rather not get hurt so they attack with a single horrendously traumatizing bite and then swim back and wait for their prey to die of blood loss
1175754 even though cartilage is vastly more elastic than bone cartilage did not result in much lower bite force at all maybe 5 percent or less
1175755 most if not all cats and a lot of dog species have more powerful bites pound for pound
1175756 but because these sharks are so big you have these giant bite forces
1175757 their teeth are very sharp and serrated more or less like steak knives so they dont need that much force to puncture and tear out flesh
1175758 and they have a conveyer belt of these teeth they keep on growing rows and rows of them so the teeth fall out and are replaced well before they go blunt
1175759 estimating the bite force in a big dead fish is a tad esoteric
1175760 the way in which we model the jaws of a shark are exactly how wed model the face of a human
1175761 you can get amazing details about the ecology and evolution of an animal by understanding how it feeds which is after all a very important part of what animals do

1175766 all the 50 million has bought is a promise in the future of water it has bought air space it will not put any water in the murray river at this time
1175767 they should not be willy nilly trying to buy water at this time there is no plan
1175768 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time

1175771 what are the signs that one has iman or in other words faith
1175772 well you should reflect on it and inshaallah if you find a certain hadith which is reported about this certain subject please report back to me because im also interested in finding out
1175773 a sign that one still has iman is that whenever he hears the quran being recited his heart is humbled and moved and in some occasions they cry in taqwa or awe
1175774 oh he will just eat off our plates but could you bring an extra plate and a shitload of napkins
1175775 that island was left in a wooded vegetative state for the sole idea of water infiltration and now that rain gardens are becoming more popular this is something we can do because of that foresight
1175776 we want to help preserve this area as much as possible
1175777 this is a special place and by living in it you dont want there to be any damage i think people in our neighborhood are very supportive of hartman and will do whatever it takes to help
1175778 the difficulty of this is these are plants that have to withstand extremes
1175779 because this is acting like a sponge there are a lot of air pockets in the soil so the idea is that it dries out quickly there will be times when the plants are super saturated and then if there are no rain events they will dry out quickly
1175780 if freedom is what we want it is ours for the taking let the revolution begin
1175781 but its fishing not catching still we are reasonably confident they will come to us to participate in our study
1175782 are they moving together are they moving individually do they have territories

1175784 sevengills have the reputation of being snippy and snappy but if you treat them nice from start to finish they treat you nice
1175785 when you catch one in the first 30 minutes its a good thing
1175786 for me the biggest surprise was that the shark went pretty far outside the bay
1175787 we tracked it to point bonita but it went much farther off and it didnt go as far inland as i imagined it would
1175788 we dont want following it to influence what it does
1175789 the last time they seemed to be doing their own thing
1175790 the issue revolves around the continuing protection of cute brown eyed fur seals he said
1175791 the study findings show similarities with studies into seal diet elsewhere in new zealand that have found seals prefer a diet of squid and oily fish species in coastal areas said doc nelson marlborough marine ecologist andrew baxter
1175792 these studies show seals are not eating species sought after by recreational fishers as is often suggested

1175832 what is stunning about china is that for the first time we have a huge poor country that can compete both with very low wages and in high tech
1175833 our commercial success in china is important to our competitiveness worldwide
1175834 as producers in china end up with significant unused capacity they will try to be much more creative in how they deploy it
1175835 the reason practically all home furnishings are now made in china factories is that they simply are better suppliers

1175857 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
1175858 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
1175859 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before

1176000 we were tired of seeing the candidates tip toe around the issues and merely pay lip service so we created this questionnaire posing specific policy questions for the candidates to answer

1176038 in any case the sale of the banking business seems quite unlikely

1176076 we could develop a centralized service that is similar to cablevisions but it doesnt preclude us from also leveraging hard drives in the home to do other things
1176077 we asked broadridge financial to doublecheck the votes it transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1176078 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1176079 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1176080 just took a few moments along the way to consider things like titles formatting how our posts look how they conclude etc they would be a lot better

1176113 you might think it is advantageous to have a precise rule
1176114 but if you have a precise rule it also makes it possible to design something that is precisely just outside the rule
1176115 therefore the more principles based approach under ifrs and what we have under uk generally accepted accounting principles makes it much more difficult to design something in such a way that it is off balance sheet
1176116 you could not rely on a specific rule to give you a yes or no answer
1176117 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time
1176118 due to the huge success of so you think you can dance my summer will be taken up by travels to south africa australia and canada to work on local versions of the show

1176122 basically its a man in a very colorful jumpsuit with something attached to a long pole going its swooping its swooping its coming around its coming down
1176123 at first when you are reacting to a traffic cone on a stick its a bit hilarious the hardest thing was not to laugh
1176124 it was a learning curve for all of us and there were a lot of giggles along the way
1176125 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
1176126 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
1176127 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
1176128 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
1176129 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
1176130 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before
1176131 if you look at space operas they show flying machines and occasionally people walk on in a pair of rubber ears personally i think the age of rubber ears is over what you need to do is to produce believable digital characters
1176132 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school

1176134 we are moving to a global village and yet we dont have our global elders the elders can be a group who have the trust of the world who can speak freely be fiercely independent and respond fast and flexibly in conflict situations
1176135 despite all the ghastliness that is around human beings are made for goodness the ones who ought to be held in high regard are not the ones who are militarily powerful nor even economically prosperous they are the ones who have a commitment to try and make the world a better place we the elders will endeavor to support those people and do our best for humanity
1176136 im not and i never was mad at senator obama i think everybodys got a right to run for president if he qualifies under the constitution and i would be the last person to ever begrudge anybody their ambition and he was a superbly gifted candidate in this election and had a great operation they thought this thing through and its a contact sport the only thing i ever got mad about was people in your kind of work pretending that she started this stuff
1176137 i got bad press because i told the truth that there was a different standard applied to the finest candidate i ever supported
1176138 you can argue that no one is ever ready to be president he has shown a keen strategic sense in his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is an important part of being president and he is smart as a whip so there is nothing that he cant learn
1176139 were delighted to have dance back for a fifth season next year

1176164 these are the 100 worst in the city and the reason its important to abate these nuisances and to get these properties torn down is that they profoundly affect the livability of our neighborhoods
1176165 what gives you snakes ive got the extension paperwork and youre not allowed to dig for two more weeks
1176166 didnt get the papers in time sonny sorry about that
1176167 once we get going we cant really un dig you know and terracarve will naturally compensate you for up to two thirds of monetary loss really
1176168 theyll likely comp you for a lot more than what yer old junk was worth in the first place
1176169 not no more it aint its a lovely layermall now fulla wokka shops and water tunnel parks now take yer compensation card and get out
1176170 so great to see so many new and different faces in the crowd
1176171 weve got folks from west bottoms weasels from gromit valley even some rabbits trekking all the way from dandelion warren
1176172 the great diversity of this crowd just shows how important this issue is it affects all of us in this earth because like it or not we all have to live here this isnt just some old crust that terracarve magmablaster or any of these other companies can dispose of at will this is our home
1176173 so far we have not been doing our job as the public the watchdogs of our own society we have been letting this development go unchecked for far too long sure its nice to not have to run miles to get necessities from the nearest wokka shop and sure why not have all your amenities and fun things located in one big layermall when its so convenient
1176174 but do we really need ten of these layermalls within one square acre wouldnt one or two of these be sufficient to meet the needs of the residents of groundswell district
1176175 as you well know these businesses have got to go somewhere and that somewhere is usually somebodys house according to my calculations well and the calculations of the groundswell district dig study group if trends keep up in one year there will be four times as many businesses as there are residents who actually live in groundswell
1176176 if nobody lives here anymore whos going to be the customers for these business does anyone want groundswell to turn into a ghost town filled with empty shops and layermalls and nothing to show for it do you want to sacrifice your home for this

1176181 in light of the continued impact of the drought and the need to better manage the australian fruit intake
1176182 spc ardmona is proactively taking this restructure to ensure our business remains competitive in the australian and international markets
1176183 the continuing strength of the australian dollar has made it more difficult to maintain a competitive position for australian exports and has correspondingly made imports relatively cheaper spca has come under increasing pressure because of the combined effects of the drought and a higher currency
1176184 the rationalisation of our manufacturing facilities will lower spcas cost base and ensure our ongoing competitive position in the domestic market
1176185 in addition we have actively diversified our business with the formation of a number of international joint ventures to supply packaged fruit and this initiative is delivering good growth and is rapidly becoming a more significant part of spcas business

1176215 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
1176216 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
1176217 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that

1176312 the focus that the study takes on just calories maybe misleading an example is diet pepsi has zero calories while lowfat milk has 130 calories so youve got to ask yourself what is healthier for kids particularly
1176313 the dietary intake calories in is probably fueling the epidemic much more than reduced physical activity

1176373 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world microsoft researcher eric horvitz said
1176374 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1176375 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network the researchers wrote in a paper detailing their work
1176376 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1176377 6 degrees of separation premise stems from an oft cited 1969 study by stanley milgram and jeffrey travers
1176378 we used a population sample that is more than two million times larger than the group studied earlier and confirmed the classic finding mr horvitz and mr leskovec concluded

1176388 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again

1176430 overall when you do something like this it is such a bonding thing when you totally push your body to the extreme you dont eat you dont sleep and you just go and film and film and edit edit and the end you just kind of collapse together and its like oh my god we did it

1176446 apakah agaknya sebab wanita ingin memakai seksi dikhalayak ramai dengan skirt pendek atau baju sendat dan nipis
1176447 tentulah kepada kaum lelaki ustaz kaum wanita pun iye juga
1176448 baiklah jika lelaki tersebut sudah tergoda dengan kecantikan tu lalu ingin menyentuh bahagian indah yang dilihatnya boleh tak
1176449 isyh ustaz ni tentulah tak boleh ustaz dah kira sexual harassment gangguan seksual tu ustaz
1176450 jika demikian tidakkah para wanita merasakan tindakan mereka yang memaparkan bahagian yang menarik di tubuh mereka itu juga merupakan gangguan seksual kepada lelaki
1176451 ye la bila orang lelaki yang dah naik syahwatnya tu kerana kecantikan peha wanita tu contohnya mestilah terganggu syahwatnya lalu terdetik keinginan seksualnya secara tidak terkawal
1176452 cuba bayangkan kucing yang lapar diacah acah dengan ikan fresh yang digoyang goyankan di hadapannya tentu geram kucing tu malah silap haribulan tentu diterkamnya muka orang yang mengacah juga
1176453 tapi perlu diingat tak semua kucing akan terkam hanya yang amat lapar dan liar je demikian juga lelaki tak semua lelaki gagal kawal nafsunya tetapi tak dinafikan bahawa ramai juga yang gagal dan liar
1176454 akhirnya kerana suasana yang tak sesuai mungkin kerana ramai orang dan di tempat awam pula terselamatlah wanita seksi itu dari terkaman lelaki liar tadi masalahnya anak anak perempuan kecil berumur 7 hingga 12 tahun yang mungkin menjadi mangsa tempiasan nafsu lelaki begini dan di ketika itu samada wanita itu bertudung berjubah kanak kanak dan sebagainya tidak lagi mampu menahan nafsu si lelaki seperti ini asalkan suasana cukup sesuai sunyi dan jauh dari pandangan ramai akan dilepaskan nafsunya secara kekerasan
1176455 hai nabi katakanlah kepada isteri isterimu anak anak perempuanmu dan isteri isteri orang mumin semua hendaklah mereka melabuhkan jilbab jilbab mereka atas muka muka mereka yang demikian itu lebih memastikan mereka agar dikenali sebagai wanita islam supaya mereka tidak diganggu
1176456 sebahagian perempuan jahiliah apabila keluar rumah mereka suka menampakkan sebahagian kecantikannya misalnya dada leher dan rambut sehingga mereka ini diganggu oleh laki laki fasik jahat dan yang suka berzina kemudian turunlah ayat di atas yang memerintahkan kepada orang orang perempuan islam untuk melabuhkan jilbabnya itu sehingga semua bahagian bahagian tubuhnya yang boleh membawa fitnah itu tidak kelihatan
1176457 eleh tetapi hari ini ramai juga wanita bertudung yang kena rogol malah setengahnya kena bunuh dijerut dengan tudungnya pulak kanak kanak pun kena rogol dan bunuh
1176458 biasanya bila seseorang itu sedang amat marah sempat tak agaknya ia berfikir bahaya atau tidak tindakan yang dibuatnya sebagai contoh ada orang yang sedang marah kerana bising tangisan kanak kanak maka ditendang seperti berita yang saya baca di akhbar baru baru ini ditolak jatuh tangga ditekup wajah kanak kanak itu dengan bantal dan macam macam lagi bagi menghilangkan kemarahan atau gangguan bising itu setelah beberapa ketika mungkin baru seolah olah dia tersedar lalu cemas dan mungkin menyesal
1176459 demikianlah juga nafsu jahat bila ia berada di tahap tinggi ia tidak lagi melihat samada kepada pakaian dan umur wanita mahupun isteri orang dihadapannya sasarannya hanya mendapatkan hajat jahatnya kerana itulah wanita yang menutup aurat dengan sempurna serta kanak kanak perempuan juga terancam tanpa dapat dinafikan juga peranan vcd laman akhbar majalah dan novel lucah
1176460 tapi macam mana pulak ayat tadi kata tutup aurat dapat mengelakkan wanita dari disakiti
1176461 jika kita lihat dengan teliti ayat tadi sebenarnya ditujukan kepada seluruh kaum wanita ini bermaksud jika sebahagian besar wanita tidak mentaatinya dan memakai pakaian seksi pula di ketika itu faedah dan kebaikan dari tutup aurat bagi menjaga semua kaum wanita dari disakiti secara umum akan tergugat dariu mencapai matlamat umumnya sebenarnya ayat itu nak beritahu bahawa seluruh wanita bertanggung jawab menjaga keselamatan kaum sejenisnya dengan menjaga aurat masing masing
1176462 maka bila ada yang seksi ini bermakna ia sedang mengancam kaum sejenisnya yang lain dan di tempat lain kerana telah menghidupkan nafsu kebinatangan lelaki jahat yang sedang tidur
1176463 astaghfirullah korang ini teruk betul la kan ustaz ada dengan kita ini
1176464 disambut dengan kata rakan di belakang ye la ini la yang bagus kita pergi masjid dengan ustaz terjaga sikit
1176465 gatal dan dah miang sangat kot orang lelaki ni memang teruk mereka ni tak sangka harap suami kita tak macam ni
1176466 dihiaskan diuji bagi manusia itu nafsu syahwat dan keinginan serta kecintaan kepada wanita anak anak harta
1176467 tidak aku tinggalkan fitnah selepasku yang lebih boleh membawa mudarat kepada lelaki selain wanita
1176468 dari jarir bin abdullah ia berkata saya bertanya kepada rasulullah s a w tentang melihat aurat wanita secara tiba tiba tanpa sengaja maka jawab nabi palingkanlah pandanganmu itu
1176469 sesungguhnya seorang hamba yang bercakap sesuatu kalimah atau ayat tanpa mengetahui implikasi dan hukum percakapannya maka kalimah itu boleh mencampakkannya di dalam neraka lebih sejauh antara timur dan barat
1176470 hendaknya mereka itu melabuhkan tudungnya sampai ke dadanya dan janganlah kamu mendedahakan aurat dan perhiasan kamu kecuali apa yang terzahir
1176471 dan hendaknya mereka itu tidak menampak nampakkan aurat dan perhiasannya kecuali terhadap suami atau ayahnya
1176472 ada dua golongan dari ahli neraka yang belum pernah saya lihat keduanya itu l kaum yang membawa cambuk seperti ekor sapi yang mereka pakai buat memukul orang penguasa yang kejam 2 perempuan perempuan yang berpakaian tetapi telanjang yang cenderung kepada perbuatan maksiat dan mencenderungkan orang lain kepada perbuatan maksiat rambutnya sebesar punuk unta mereka ini tidak akan boleh masuk syurga serta tidak dapat akan mencium bau syurga padahal bau syurga itu tercium sejauh perjalanan demikian dan demikian
1176473 hai asma sesungguhnya seorang perempuan apabila sudah haidh cukup umurnya tidak patut diperlihatkan tubuhnya itu melainkan ini dan ini sambil ia menunjuk muka dan dua tapak tangannya
1176474 allah sentiasa merahmati para wanita yang memakai seluar panjang di sebelah dalamnya
1176475 janganlah perempuan perempuan itu berlaku lemah dengan perkataannya sebab akan menaruh harapan orang yang dalam hatinya ada penyakit
1176476 maka syaitan membisikkan fikiran jahat kepada keduanya untuk menampakkan kepada keduanya yang tertutup dari mereka iaitu auratnya
1176477 wahai anak adam telah kami turunkan buat kamu pakaian yang boleh menutup aurat aurat kamu dan untuk perhiasan
1176478 orang wanita bertudung pun banyak yang jahat hari ini berzina khalwat dan macam macam lagi
1176479 malah kami juga baik kami tak kacau orang tak mengumpat dan buat benda benda tak elok
1176480 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat kepada tubuh rupa luaran dan harta kamu tetapi melihat kepada hati dan amalan kamu
1176481 seorang pekerja yang dijumpai oleh majikannya sedang bermain game semasa waktu kerjanya sedangkan dokumen yang dipinta si boss masih tidak disiapkan lalu si majikan berkata
1176482 saya luaran je nampak main game boss tapi hati saya ikhlas dan saya kerja dengan cemerlang
1176483 ketahuilah bahawa di dalam diri anak adam itu ada seketul daging yang bila ianya baik maka baik seseorang itu dan apabila buruk buruklah amalan seseorang itu ketahuilah ia adalah hati
1176484 sesungguhnya aku hanya manusia dan kamu sentiasa membawa kes pertikaian untuk di selesaikan olehku dan mungkin sebahagian kami lebih cekap berhujjah dari sebahagian lainnya maka aku telah memutuskan hukuman berdasarkan apa yang kudengari sahaja barangsiapa yang telah ku jatuhi hukuman dan hukuman itu mengambil hak yang lain akibat kurang cekap pihak yang benar dalam berhujjah maka jangalah kamu mengambilnya sesungguhnya ia bakal menjadi sepotong api neraka
1176485 sesiapa yang mempelopori sesuatu yang buruk maka ke atasnya dosa dan dosa setiap orang yang membuatnya tanpa sedikit kurang pun dosanya
1176486 no as a matter of fact muhammed lived in the desert
1176487 he i is aware of an atoms weight in the heavens and on the earth and even anything smaller than that
1176488 although the prophets advice was sound and applicable to the time in which he lived allah in his infinite wisdom knew that there would come later medical and scientific advances which would make the prophets advice appear outdated when later discoveries occurred people might say that such information contradicted that which the prophet had given thus since allah would never allow any opportunity for the non muslims to claim that the quran contradicts itself or the teachings of the prophet he only included in the quran information and examples which could stand the test of time
1176489 i was so afraid that i ran home to my wife
1176490 if you have theory do not bother us with it unless you bring with that theory a way for us to prove whether you are wrong or not

1176492 this is my idea and if you want to try to prove me wrong do this or try that
1176493 if this book is not what it claims to be then all you have to do is this or this or this to prove that it is false
1176494 is there any falsification test in your religion is there anything in your religion that would prove you are wrong if i could prove to you that it exists anything
1176495 do they not consider the quran had it been from any other than allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy
1176496 this exam is perfect there are no mistakes in it find one if you can
1176497 if you want to know more about this or that or if you doubt what is said then you should ask those who have knowledge
1176498 here is what the quran says is it the truth
1176499 this is what the quran says about your subject is it true what can you tell us
1176500 dont you think that maybe the arabs might have known about these things the description of the embryo its appearance and how it changes and grows maybe there were not scientists but maybe they did something crude dissections on their own carved up people and examined these things
1176501 it does not matter if someone had tried to discover embryology fourteen centuries ago they could not have seen it
1176502 maybe fourteen centuries ago someone secretly had a microscope and did this research making no mistakes anywhere then he somehow taught muhammad and convinced him to put this information in his book then he destroyed his equipment and kept it a secret forever do you believe that you really should not unless you bring some proof because it is such a ridiculous theory
1176503 this is not new we know where muhammad got this information we learned this at school
1176504 i am going to go home tonight and find a mistake in the quran
1176505 congratulations that is the most intelligent thing that you have said
1176506 this book is a divine revelation if you do not believe that then what is it
1176507 one thing we know for sure that man muhammad thought he was a prophet he was crazy
1176508 because of this evidence one thing we know for sure is that that man muhammad was a liar
1176509 how will i fool the people tomorrow so that they think i am a prophet
1176510 if it came from his head then where did he get the information contained in it certainly the quran mentions many things with which the arabs were not familiar
1176511 well maybe he was not crazy maybe some foreigner brought him the information so he lied and told people that he was a prophet
1176512 if muhammad was a liar then where did he get his confidence why did he behave as though he really thought he was a prophet
1176513 well maybe he wasnt a liar he was probably crazy and really thought that he was a prophet
1176514 if muhammad was a liar where did he get his confidence why did he tell some people out right to their face what others could never say
1176515 what did he tell you did he say black well its white did he say morning well its night
1176516 i heard that it has been revealed to muhammad that i will never change that i will never become a muslim and will enter the hellfire well i want to become a muslim now how do you like that what do you think of your divine revelation now
1176517 you hate me and you want to finish me here say these words and i am finished come on say them
1176518 hey abu bakr see if you can find a back way out of this cave
1176519 squat down in that corner over there and keep quiet
1176520 relax allah is with us and allah will save us
1176521 well i tell you if that book is not the bible it was written by a man
1176522 let me tell you something about what is in that book
1176523 you are right a man did not write that book the devil wrote it
1176524 oh if i had been there i would not have been as stupid as the jews
1176525 oh the devil did it the devil wrote that book
1176526 and they say surely he is possessed by jinn but it i is not except a reminder to the worlds
1176527 no evil ones have brought it i down it would neither be fitting for them nor would they be able indeed they have been removed far from hearing
1176528 so when you recite the quran seek refuge in allah from shaytaan the rejected
1176529 before you read my book ask god to save you from me
1176530 do they not consider the quran had it been from any other than allah they would surely have found therein much discrepancy
1176531 o k you say you are the king of england so tell me where the queen is today and where is your prime minister and where are your guards
1176532 oh mankind there has come to you an admonition i from your lord and a healing for what is in the hearts and guidance and mercy for the believers
1176533 oh mankind you say such and such about this but what about such and such how can you say this when you know that
1176534 over the centuries many theories have been offered as to the origin of the quran today no sensible man accepts any of these theories
1176535 oh the quran came from here the quran came from there
1176536 do not listen to these unconfirmed reports about the quran
1176537 show me one deception show me where the quran deceives me show me otherwise dont say that it is a deception
1176538 do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together then we clove them asunder and made from water every living thing will they not then believe
1176539 all of this you see pointing to yourself is made up of mostly water
1176540 now what does your holy book say about who are your best friends in the world the jews or the christians look what we jews have done for you
1176541 the bee that you see flying around it could be male or it could be female i think i will guess female
1176542 back home in india they are having supper right now
1176543 you have just come here how could you know my father
1176544 tell me is my father tall short dark fair what is he like
1176545 i guess you do know my father i dont know how you know him but i guess you do
1176546 convince me if the author of this book really originated life and everything in the heavens and on the earth then he should know about this about that and so on
1176547 say i exhort you to one thing that you stand for allah assessing the truth by twos and singly and then reflect in conclusion i ask you to consider with care the following
1176548 and they say why are not signs sent down to him from his lord say indeed the signs are with allah and i am but a clear warner but is sufficient for them that we have sent down to you the book i which is rehearsed to them verily in that is mercy and a reminder to people who believe
1176549 take note all of the platform as a service plays from amazons s3 and ec2 and googles appengine to salesforces force
1176550 im not trying to be shocking to anyone but lets face it
1176551 when bear stearns goes down freddie and fannie go down and indymac goes broke we have major issues out there
1176552 every one who makes application to an lvt knows that the lease is the most important document in the bundle its the first thing that the tribunal reviews
1176553 the legal opinion we have received is clear the lease must be restrictively interpreted it does not make provision for a charge to fund an ila why havent officers asked these questions
1176554 more importantly why hasnt mr potter and his chums who plan to run a service offering legal advice to leaseholders also asked these questions they are apparently incapable of reading their own leases properly let alone offering legal advice to anyone
1176555 i have looked at many examples of leases written by islington and i would find it difficult to believe that a charge for a leaseholders association could be made
1176556 having read my lease i am not at present intending to pay any levy towards a leaseholders association
1176557 you will note the referral at sub clause 2 to the third schedule the detail of the items forming the charges are set out there and pursuant to clause 5 2 f the same schedule is used to determine the proportion of the costs and expenses you pay

1176664 this bill could have huge energy implications as all land permanently locked up under this bill would also mean these lands are permanently off limits to energy development
1176665 right now the best plan congress can come up with to solve our energy woes is to take a five week vacation to make matters worse if this bill were signed it would be just another step backwards in the goal to increase american energy production
1176666 america needs action from congress to ensure that our local and national economies grow stronger and more resilient to do that they will need the vital resources available from secure american sources in addition locking up land would prevent many recreational activities and would be devastating for the people who hunt fish camp raise their kids and try to earn a living on and around these lands it is in the best interest of our constituents that the president veto this bill should it come before him

1176806 we sent a messenger to every nation sayings worship allah and avoid the idols
1176807 they are enveloped in darkness in other words are steeped in ignorance and sunk in the greatest depths of misery who worship the uncreated eternal prakrti the material cause of the world in place of the all pervading god but those who worship visible things born of the prakrti such as the earth trees bodies human and the like in place of god are enveloped in still greater darkness in other words they are extremely foolish fall into an awful hell of pain and sorrow and suffer terribly for a long time
1176808 those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures
1176809 deaf dumb and blind they will not return to the path
1176810 there maybe someone who sees the words and yet indeed does not see them may be another one who hears these words but indeed does not hear them
1176811 brahma abrahim stayed in this abode which is illumined by heavenly light and covered with divine blessings it is the place that gives spiritual life to the people and is unconquerable

1176834 ich freue mich ber die anteilnahme die kanzlerin hat aber noch nicht angerufen
1176835 die op war keine schlachtaktion das karriere ende ist kein thema ich habe es gut berstanden
1176836 die wollten mir erz hlen dass ich nichts habe obwohl ichs scheppern geh rt habe sie haben mir einen gips angelegt das tat noch mehr weh als vorher
1176837 du denkst dass kann nicht wahr sein ich habe die vorbereitung hinter mir dann passiert so ein schei e
1176838 in berlin fange ich sofort mit der reha an ich habe eine verpflichtung fit zu werden auch meiner familie gegen ber ich muss ja geld verdienen
1176839 jeder kann treffen wir haben vorne eine hohe qualit t
1176840 es macht spa zu sehen dass wir vorne schon diese effektivit t haben
1176841 ich hoffe wir k nnen das mit in die saison nehmen
1176842 kurze betten bin ich auch in amerika gewohnt ich konnte im olympischen dorf gut schlafen
1176843 ich wei dass es normalerweise jemand macht der schon vier oder f nfmal bei olympia war f r wen die entscheidung auch ausf llt es ist okay f r mich
1176844 ich werde nat rlich mit meinem mann nach madrid gehen doch ein bisschen bleibe ich deutschland erhalten
1176845 ich liebe deutschland die menschen sind sehr nett zu uns gewesen ich m chte immer mit diesem land verbunden bleiben
1176846 wir lieben es mittendrin zu leben wie auch schon in hamburg
1176847 es f llt mir schon sehr schwer hamburg zu verlassen wir haben viele tolle freunde gefunden das leben hier ist heiter und angenehm
1176848 das war schon ein schock ich bin schlie lich nur wegen heynckes gewechselt er wollte mich f rdern
1176849 ich sp re wieder das vertrauen von trainer jos luhukay das war nicht immer so das gibt viel selbstbewusstsein und ich bin einfach fit wie nie
1176850 damit rechne ich noch nicht aber ich habe trotz meiner nur 21 jahre bereits erlebt wie schnell es im fu ball gehen kann deshalb bin ich berzeugt dass der trainer ber kurz oder lang nicht an mir vorbeikommt
1176851 nein aber wenn wir uns erst eingelebt haben nehmen meine frau christina und ich gemeinsam einen lehrer
1176852 ja vor allem der stra enverkehr ist hier viel angenehmer frankfurt ist eine sch ne stadt ich wei dass es einen zoo und eine oper gibt das will ich mir alles ansehen
1176853 ja klar ich war noch nie in einer oper aber ich w rde gern mal eine sehen unser nationaltrainer otto schw rmt davon
1176854 ich hoffe die nationalelf ist eine ehre und ich bin seit 1996 dabei
1176855 nein vor zwei jahren war eintracht ja im uefa cup letztes jahr fehlten nur ein paar punkte so weit ist der europacup nicht weg in frankfurt
1176856 es ist eine ganz andere trainingsintensit t als ich sie kenne aber bis zum start bin ich fit
1176857 ich habe schon b se berraschungen erlebt als gro er musst du dich ganz besonders konzentrieren ich hoffe dass bei meinem eintracht deb t alles normal l uft
1176858 nat rlich habe ich hier noch nicht den stellenwert wie in griechenland ich muss mir alles neu erarbeiten aber ich werde der eintracht in den n chsten zwei jahren helfen
1176859 ich habe schon als jugendlicher gelernt mit harten verteidigern umzugehen da war ich immer der j ngste und als torj ger wurde ich auch in griechenland extrem gejagt
1176860 klar werde ich in athen erkannt und angesprochen aber das ist ja auch anerkennung wenn man bewundert wird mein ziel ist so lange wie m glich auf h chstem niveau zu spielen trotz meines alters habe ich mich mit dem wechsel in eine top liga jetzt noch mal verbessert ich kann es gar nicht erwarten in all diesen stadien und gegen klubs wie bayern zu spielen
1176861 die nr 10 ist eine gro e ehre f r mich
1176862 weil wir nicht wissen wo herr gomez wohnt war die vollstreckbarkeit des titels bislang nicht m glich
1176863 ich habe nicht so viele angriffsspieler deshalb muss ich mir optionen erarbeiten
1176864 ich nehme mir diese freiheiten und habe das auch der mannschaft erkl rt
1176865 es ist die entscheidung des trainers er sieht dass es mit einem st rmer alleine schwer ist und noch ist manasseh ishiaku verletzt da will er so etwas eben ausprobieren
1176866 das hat mir berhaupt nicht gefallen und muss auf jeden fall noch besser werden
1176867 wir waren auf der suche nach einem athletischen power forward der auch von au en werfen kann
1176868 die summe hat mich fr her nie interessiert das war nur ein sch nes zubrot bei olympia ist gold wichtiger als geld
1176869 in the past 70 years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the past 11 400 years mars jupiter neptunes largest moon and pluto warmed at the same time as earth

1176871 just because you dont see fairies on the lawn doesnt mean there are no fairies on the lawn
1176872 i think the big challenge really in doing a sequel is to build on what youve done in the first film but not abandon the characters the logic the storm rider clash of the evils
1176873 schon sehr geringe konzentrationen an uran haben eine sch digende wirkung auf lebenswichtige vorg nge in der niere
1176874 es wird empfohlen dies zu tun verlangen kann man es formal noch nicht weil es noch keinen grenzwert in der trinkwasserverordnung gibt
1176875 das bedeutet aber nicht dass der wert von zehn berschritten werden darf denn 6 abs 1 der trinkwasserverordnung sagt ganz klar dass trinkwasser keinerlei anlass zu gesundheitlicher besorgnis bieten darf
1176876 hallo frau doktor thiele ich 50 hatte seit 6 jahren keinen geschlechtsverkehr mehr jetzt habe ich geh rt dass sich nach so langer zeit das jungfernh utchen wieder bildet stimmt das bedeutet das gleichzeitig dass ich beim n chsten sex wieder bluten kann oder schmerzen habe
1176877 liebe monika nein das jungfernh utchen w chst nicht wieder nach egal wie lange man keinen sex mehr hatte offensichtlich haben sie sich l ngere zeit nicht mit ihrem k rper befasst das k nnen sie ganz leicht ndern machen sie sich mit ihrer scheide vertraut nehmen sie einen handspiegel legen sich entspannt auf das bett und betrachten alles in ruhe nehmen sie dazu auch den finger zu hilfe und pr fen sie wie sich alles anf hlt haben sie das gef hl dass der scheideneingang sehr eng ist k nnen sie ein sogenanntes vaginal dilatationsset verschreibt der gyn kologe oder einen vibrator nehmen trotzdem k nnte nach einiger zeit ohne sex das erste mal verkehr etwas un angenehm sein meistens werden die frauen dann nicht so schnell entspannt und feucht beziehungsweise die scheide dehnt sich nicht so schnell aus aber meistens legen sich diese probleme relativ schnell wieder wichtig ist dass sie entspannt an ihre sexuellen kontakte mit dem neuen partner herangehen nehmen sie sich zeit es muss ja nicht sofort geschlechtsverkehr sein machen sie ruhig erst einmal petting oder stimulieren sie sich mit der hand wenn sie das gef hl haben dass sie trotz toller erregung nicht richtig feucht werden dann scheuen sie sich nicht gleitgel zu verwenden rein vom alter her k nnten sie ja schon in den wechseljahren sein dann ist die scheide aufgrund weniger weibliche geschlechtshormone verletzungs und entz ndungsanf lliger ihr frauenarzt ber t sie sicherlich gern ob sie zum beispiel zus tzlich scheidenz pfchen oder tabletten benutzen sollten
1176878 mein freund und ich haben eine fernbeziehung dadurch haben wir kaum sex und wenn dann komme ich nicht zum h hepunkt
1176879 meinem partner ist es oft unangenehm gestreichelt zu werden er sagt ich mache ihn nicht mehr an was kann ich tun
1176880 believing that god doesnt exist because his followers do bad things is like
1176881 sie ist ausdruck von pers nlichkeit status lebensgef hl und individualit t dahinter steckt ich will nicht so sein wie ihr das ist der konfliktstoff schlechthin in der pubert t kleidung ist f r jugendliche die einfachste art zu provozieren auf abwehr zu gehen revolte zu proben und sich so von ihren eltern abzugrenzen
1176882 wenn eltern versuchen ihren kindern einen bestimmten kleidungsstil vorzuschreiben ist der konflikt programmiert weil aus dem streit um die klamotten meist etwas grunds tzliches wird
1176883 die eltern sagen ich sage hier was du anziehst und die kinder denken du kannst mich mal
1176884 die kunst ist es dem kind grenzen zu setzen ohne den kontakt zu ihm zu verlieren
1176885 ich will zeigen dass ich zu dieser gruppe geh re und will mich von anderen abgrenzen
1176886 beim streiten auf den ton achten und deutlich machen dass man zwar die kleidung nicht sch n findet das kind aber trotzdem liebt so wie es ist
1176887 ein erfolgreiches leben f hrt man wenn man gl cklich ist
1176888 die m nner zeigten stresssymptome wie sonst nur kampfpiloten w hrend des einsatzes das schlimmste 70 prozent hatten schon schwei ausbr che bevor sie das haus verlie en
1176889 dabei schont es gelenke und knochen und f rdert au erdem noch die kondition
1176890 ist aber total intensiv im wasser merkt man nicht so viel aber sobald ich an land bin habe ich m de beine
1176891 aber alex ist ja profi da kann man ein bisschen mehr machen
1176892 cut the hours of the guys at the bottom first
1176893 im vergleich zu den anderen teams sind wir in sehr guter verfassung

1176895 frank schumann und andrius stelmokas waren an ihrem limit angekommen dagegen hat rico g de noch viel entwicklungs potential jonathan rivera ist ein verstecktes juwel
1176896 wir achten auf das was wir machen besprechen alles und die spieler verinnerlichen es

1176955 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is
1176956 two went in saturday and so there was no more rehearsals and today sunday all the rehearsals were called off
1176957 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of blood work to see if theres anything else
1176958 the other two dancers could not rehearse as well and so hopefully everybody is going to be in the same boat hopefully everybody will be refreshed by having a full day off
1176959 so they keep pushing themselves and pushing themselves and not letting anybody know that hey im running on empty and then it catches up on them and then they collapse

1176965 games are different from other art media because of their interactivity
1176966 so if a game is expressing something and doing it well then you shouldnt be able to understand that thing from screenshots because the meat of the expression should come from the interactivity
1176967 stamp duty is always a factor when people buy and sell houses but we need to make sure that we support the financial system too
1176968 every player is well aware of that and i know a lot of those guys
1176969 we are under their shadow and to come out of that you have play well week in and week out and until you do that shadow will always be here
1176970 thats part of it when you keep your core guys
1176971 in the 1980s and 90s they had turnover but they kept a core of guys and when you do that that becomes your team
1176972 guys will come and go but keeping your core is the key get the guys who you want to be a part of your organization and keep them
1176973 i think the elements are here but they have to be developed
1176974 youll see that this season were quiet and were just trying to come together for one goal were not bragging about what well do when the season starts it will emerge who these guys are
1176975 the one thing we gained from last year was we came together as a team with all the injuries all the guys got experience
1176976 it created a team atmosphere and allowed guys to trust each other on the field when it comes to looking for an identity in that way weve already got it
1176977 its understandable the fans want to get back there so of course theyll bring it up
1176978 its up to us not to make them forget but to give them something else to remember and i think well be able to do it
1176979 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1176980 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1176981 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1176982 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1176983 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1176984 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1176985 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1176986 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1176987 weve got to get him ready for the season and we have to get other people ready for the season also
1176988 bypass the old world gatekeepers to communicate to the masses
1176989 theres no reason anyone should whine or complain that they are being shut out of the system
1176990 in the past they had felt such a boundless understanding between them that their souls had as it were put their arms round each other
1176991 was there just a hint of mockery in his voice

1176995 evolution is one of the reasons i dont believe in god
1176996 i think its scandalous how little our children are taught about evolution

1177001 the amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute that it takes me to say this millions of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within for most animals the reality is struggling suffering and death
1177002 i think ive got chicken legs and now dammit im making money outta these chicken legs
1177003 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1177004 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1177005 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1177006 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1177007 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1177008 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue
1177009 were preparing for a category 2 though we believe it wont be that severe
1177010 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1177011 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1177012 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1177013 to hell with it forget why we are there we just need to win
1177014 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1177015 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1177016 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1177017 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1177018 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat

1177031 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1177032 also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1177033 more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1177034 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1177035 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1177036 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1177037 many more men would scorn to be thought evil in practice despise any time spent on theological study as a fruitless waste of time
1177038 truly it is impossible for a man to be a lover of god and a lover of pleasure at the same time
1177039 some men i know are willing for the wearisomeness of study out of an excessive lusting for worldly wealth all the while promising themselves that future ease which will destroy all their potential for useful work
1177040 it is for no other reason than a failure to subdue sinful nature and carnal habits before the spirit and grace of christ that we see so many men who profess to have committed themselves to the study of liberal arts and especially theology finally grow weary and fall into the ways of negligence and sloth
1177041 or it could be due to the general cost of living and the living situations people are finding themselves in and difficulties in finding suitable accommodation
1177042 there is a huge fluidity of the young ones one day theyre there the next day theyre gone
1177043 the older guys are pretty consistent they are a little bit more visible and lets face it at 41 to 50 if you are not well set in a career by that stage its very hard to get into one
1177044 this project has much wider implications not only in the field of poverty reduction but in a number of areas
1177045 its made an effort in what i call making space and providing opportunity making space for government and civil society and poor people
1177046 i cant say in all 16 pilot villages that everything ended happily but the initial friction and resentment gave way to a recognition of the benefits
1177047 at first i didnt get why we should open up our government resources to share with these ngos i mean that was originally the governments money why should we give it to them
1177048 and when we let them do these things were essentially giving up some of our power i couldnt understand that at first
1177049 not all of the power can be in the hands of the government and the party we should loosen our grip and let society take part in the conduct of government

1177052 any motor vehicle parked on a public highway or public ground against which there are three or more unpaid or otherwise unsettled parking citations may be removed by towing
1177053 the current code does not allow for civil fine collection methods and is outmoded and wastes county resources in achieving the necessary compliance with the countys parking regulations
1177054 in the event that the defendant elects not to contest the citation issued against him for parking a vehicle in violation of this article he may within 30 days of receipt of such citation pay the minimum fine set forth of the citation to the director of finance prince william county or his designated agent

1177057 we looked at half of australias remaining forests and our estimate is they can store around 33 billion tonnes of co2 these are very big numbers
1177058 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the soil released into the atmosphere that would be the equivalent of about 80 per cent of australias annual emissions every year for 100 years so we really have to protect our natural forests
1177059 its the big old trees that have a very high amount of carbon and also the coarse woody debris the dead standing trees and the dead logs on the ground that are there in the natural undisturbed forests
1177060 its the forests that enable us to act early and make deep cuts and that applies whether its australia or globally
1177061 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1177062 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1177063 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1177064 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1177065 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1177066 as i said well make our decisions alans a contracted player
1177067 were not hiding anything we will take our time to consider our situation because theres nothing worse than making these decisions on the run unfortunately for us it has changed
1177068 the situation i think was that they were looking after alan after your paper slaughtered him last year
1177069 as a result of that thats compromised the decision making process during the day
1177070 they came to us and told us later that didak was in the car we are going to have a little bit of time to work through things and reconsider the situation
1177071 we have tried our best to be as honest as we can with everybody with the information that we had in front of us
1177072 and now that we have new evidence in front of us we will consider that and in the cool light of day and make a decision
1177073 it is time these guys grew up and took responsibility
1177074 weve had enough of these blokes letting us down theyre not five year olds now theyre grown men
1177075 coach mick malthouse breaks his neck week in and out and is dragged down by clowns enough is enough
1177076 he just gave us his details and was very co operative it was heath and alan didak in the car i wouldnt have guessed that they were over the limit
1177077 i recognised didak they said they swerved to avoid a possum he shaw did not look like he was really pissed
1177078 he wasnt near there but a short time after he was we were together then we went separate ways then i called him because i didnt really know what to do
1177079 the police have a statement about who was in the car the name of the person is a friend of heaths its not alan didak its no one associated with the club
1177080 the time is here for us to do our jobs and have colin barnett in the leadership
1177081 it is too late at this stage to try and elect somebody new
1177082 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1177083 mr foley says were on the verge of an unprecedented resources boom
1177084 the gains from that ought not be squandered our children deserve their share of the states prosperity
1177085 could well have been a factor in msps decision to initiate an investigation
1177086 however it is pretty clear that the groups and individuals under surveillance were not a threat in the intelligence field a lot of decisions come down to judgment calls in retrospect the msp should have ended the surveillance much earlier than it did quite clearly continuing the operation was a bad call
1177087 a special legislative oversight committee similar to congressional oversight committees would be good start to ensure that the msp is following both federal and state guidelines
1177088 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore
1177089 irans position which was first expressed by the imam khomeini and stated several times by those responsible is that the cancerous tumor called israel must be uprooted from the region
1177090 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore
1177091 through traffic on i 66 will not be impeded by slower traffic merging on
1177092 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore
1177093 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1177094 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1177095 boasted of being involved in the transport of wmd warheads to syria
1177096 they knew the locations of the missile hulls buried in iraq
1177097 if they lied about this that and the other thing then perhaps theyve misled on iraq
1177098 ive got the same feeling now that ive had the past 24 years going to training camp whether it was at western michigan or philadelphia or baltimore
1177099 the success weve enjoyed in 2008 can be directly attributed to the strength of our 40 territories across the u s puerto rico and the hawaiian islands though im a tad biased the numbers certainly bear out that our people are among the best in the business
1177100 from what we see in our pipeline we are confident we will set yet another record in august for cases invoiced
1177101 the formula weve created with l amp w investigations local investigations offices supported by a national network is working even in the face of some very trying economic times
1177102 thats why as happy as we are with having a record month of july we know it means working just as hard if not harder to continue the success weve enjoyed thus far in 2008 fortunately we have the right team in place in all our locations to achieve that objective
1177103 obama has to say and do what he is saying and doing to win the election
1177104 i teased him to go school here but he said
1177105 but he will agree if theres a playground and nice washroom in school lol
1177106 theyll come down in their shirts and helmets do a normal stretch jog through their special teams and then theyll do a big separate deal where theyre on opposite sides of the field and then we will come together and run some five on fives against each other but it will just be jog through pace
1177107 some people are afraid of being filmed i think im afraid of not being filmed
1177108 we got sharon stone and well get a shot of her naked but then were gonna pull her from the set and stick her in a press box to be interviewed by et and access hollywood we dont really want her in the movie
1177109 so the point is if everyone would just agree on loving thier neighbor what a more wonderful world it would be
1177110 as far as the loony bloggers are concerned i guess that there is not much to worry about since the only people that would waste their time reading their nonsense would be other loonies
1177111 where is the computation of how much money the government receives from cellphone licences what a load of b t you cranks hand out with your hysterical rantings and smug self congratulations for fictional victories
1177112 firstly can we be clear i would strongly prefer people not to be rude to mr coghill
1177113 i actually thought sue mcginty from bant was very nice and although our discussion was very revealing about the culture within the profession i wouldnt want anyone to be mean about her as an individual
1177114 so it follows that there is no definitive evidence that mmr does not cause autism
1177115 there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today

1177122 just some writing advice hope i dont come off as aggressively lecturesome
1177123 deep inside i know im wrong so im going to lash out
1177124 at present does not seem to have predictive power sufficient to form the basis for experimental verification
1177125 even when they told me that they didnt want me to have surgery i was like i dont understand
1177126 i dont understand how this thing is going to get any better because i couldnt lift my arm up but it just started getting better every single day it feels good

1177132 our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers
1177133 we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy despite having been paid in full by our company
1177134 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1177135 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1177136 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1177137 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again
1177138 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised by who not a bureaucrat a senior doctor
1177139 this issue was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
1177140 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
1177141 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
1177142 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
1177143 i think it is utterly irresponsible to speculate about that and i certainly wont be doing that
1177144 i certainly think australian home owners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank
1177145 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other
1177146 but we have perhaps the most difficult global conditions in over 25 years
1177147 chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1177148 the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1177149 responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally orientated and threatening correspondence

1177172 our programming strategy is to try to deliver the best experience on the best platform and by far that is the best way
1177173 weve got these passionate passionate taekwondo fans passionate equestrian fans folks whove grown up playing the sports whose children play them and for whom the olympics is the ultimate expression of their sport despite the fact that weve been putting it on five cable networks with as much press time as we can we have not been able to serve the audience as effective they want us to
1177174 weve decided not to do live commentary on every hour of those more than 2 000 live streams because of the costs
1177175 this has been a big initiative with us and with the ioc as well weve invested a lot in the olympus and as a consequence will work very hard to protect that investment weve worked with the ioc on fingerprint solutions and worked with some of the major ugc distributors including youtube to find a way to identify videos not being put out by nbc
1177176 it will be very quick i cant give you a per second by second analysis but our goal is to catch it before its posted thats the intention theres no such thing as a perfect system in the world of the internet because theres always a place some analog method where someone can post something
1177177 we spent a tremendous time of amount and effort to deliver the olympics and the best experiences we can and we want to make sure we preserve that because that reflects well on the olympics and reflects well on nbc
1177178 we have to deliver what we promise and we have to work hard to preserve the integrity of the brand
1177179 web 2 0 is one of those big buzzwords that no one knows what it means if it means that the world is a community and tying that community together we do have a strategy there
1177180 the rights landscape is what it is we are protecting our rights within our territory
1177181 its not necessarily an environment that lends itself to germination of ideas and people sharing clips and being able to form communities over time i mean youre going to be in and out of swimming in eight or nine days so thats why we think the better place for this is in universal sports where you can form that community and lend people the tools to experiment
1177182 you pass it to your friends and the faster you pass you win or if you drop it you get notified i think its a fun application and it helps people connect we find ways for people to connect but ultimately we want people to go to nbcolympics com because we think its the best place to experience these games
1177183 we cant deliver you results for 34 sports and 10 000 athlete bios and breaking news every day in a facebook widget its not complete and so we think the best experience is to come to nbcolympics com as a hub and connect to other places

1177185 there was something truly filthy my emphasis about china and russias vetoes of the american led un security council effort to impose targeted sanctions on robert mugabes ruling clique in zimbabwe

1177191 the meat needs to be a mix of fatty and lean not raw not rare it must be medium rare at the same time the bread needs to be smooth tepid toasted on the sesame side i like to brush the soft side with butter there needs to be a crispy chiffonade of iceberg lettuce everything plays a role
1177192 we cling to things like the soft buns sweet and sour pickles onions tomatoes cheese we need these guideposts because we dont have the history the context otherwise for us its not a burger its a hot sandwich
1177193 what you have is texture and the flavor of meat
1177194 a hamburger whats that i didnt get it then i tasted it at db bistro moderne
1177195 if daniel hadnt done it maybe i wouldnt have either he helped me understand
1177196 i think its shocking but at the same time the french are realizing that a burger is real food its good
1177197 nobody ever saw a burger until 10 years ago everybody was against it but everybody goes to eat it
1177198 but nine out of 10 people use knife and fork im happy not to see it im in the kitchen

1177221 as i was walking to the passport control i was stopped not once not twice but three times by whom i assumed were plain clothed security officers
1177222 they barked at me demanding to know why i was visiting israel where i was going where i would be staying and who i would be talking to this was a surprise to me especially as i am british and always considered my country to have had good relations with israel frankly i was given the impression that i simply was not welcome either they are a country plagued by paranoia or they are just simply very rude certainly from a tourists point of view this is not an experience i would willingly put myself through
1177223 when the taxi driver told me that palestinian homes had been demolished in order to allow this settlement to be built i was in disbelief how could the world stand by and let this happen
1177224 be warm welcoming and very friendly despite the enormous oppression they are obviously under my country the uk and the worlds media have lied for years about the situation in palestine and are in turn helping israel to suppress the palestinians
1177225 palestine felt like a concrete box with the walls closing in on you leading to feelings of suffocation and desperation
1177226 i saw no terrorism whatsoever neither was there any talk of it from the palestinian people in fact perhaps the only terrorism i saw was the way the palestinian people were being treated for example at the bethlehem checkpoint where two palestinian men were forced to stand aside to allow tourists to pass by them israel has the military might and the financial backing to be the oppressor
1177227 if an occupier came to england appropriated our land stuck me behind a wall and tried to control my everyday way of life im sure a few frustrated brits would resort to desperate measures in order to fight back i dont condone any forms of killing or terrorism but now that i have seen what is really going on in this conflict i better understand the plight of the palestinians and do not think that those defending themselves against a powerful state should be labelled as terrorists

1177233 the question here is much bigger than the state of roraima its a question of national integration
1177234 not just on the part of indians but from land grabbers prospectors and loggers who would take it as a signal that reservations could be invaded
1177235 if they decide against us it would be the worst thing that can happen to indigenous people across brazil
1177236 those people the settlers think their contribution to the economy and their control of the local institutions make them right
1177237 if we take the concept of prior occupation too far
1177238 we will have to hand my marvelous city of rio de janeiro over to the indians
1177239 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away

1177291 renewed international interest in meiers claims of personal contacts with extraterrestrial humans for over 66 years also coincides with the total collapse of the skeptical challenges chief among those who have long characterized meiers stunning photographic film and video evidence as merely an easily duplicated hoax done with models has been the international professional skeptics organizations cfi west and iig affiliated with skeptical debunker james randi

1177298 last week in close consultation with the treasury and the fed the sec issued an order to further the objective of existing commission rules that restrict naked short selling
1177299 the sec is focusing on four rumors that circulated about wall street firm lehman brothers holdings inc in recent weeks as the commissions investigation into potential market manipulation heats up top lehman executives believe traders who profit when a stock falls known as short sellers have been spreading allegedly false rumors about their stock in an attempt to drive it down market manipulation cases are difficult to prove authorities must prove that traders knew the information was false and spread it with the intention of profiting from its dissemination
1177300 asked for an example of false market rumors bringing down a firm harvard financial historian niall ferguson thought for a moment you might look at france in the 18th century he suggested ironies abound for one thing rumors about bear stearns losses appear to have been true confirmed by the federal regulators who oversaw the forced sale of the firm for another the list of the largest financial firms being protected from naked short selling by hedge funds includes several being investigated for potential manipulation of bear stearns and lehman shares still another fannie mae and freddie mac are among those being protected even though forensic accounting short sellers naked or not were right over the years to warn that the federal housing insurers were putting taxpayers at real risk a final irony in the credit crisis the one class of financial services firm that has not collapsed or begged for a bailout is the hedge fund industry james chanos last week wrote mr cox that artificial restrictions on short sales undermine the integrity of prices in our markets because they remove liquidity and more importantly healthy skepticism from the market place there is a long history of selling short the short selling messengers of bad news that turned out to be accurate
1177301 lignite and hard coal energy suppliers for world needs until the year 2100 an outlook
1177302 i t is important to estimate expected atmospheric co 2 levels for realistic estimates of fossil fuel reserves and to determine how the co 2 level depends upon possible constraints on coal use
1177303 implications of peak oil for atmospheric co 2 and climate
1177304 peak oil emission occurs in 2016 2 yr peak gas in 2026 2 yr and peak coal in 2077 2 yr
1177305 is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co 2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions
1177306 e ven if coal reserves are much lower than historically assumed there is surely enough coal to take the world past 450 ppm co 2 without mitigation efforts such as those described here
1177307 our producer limited profile has future fossil fuel production that is lower than all 40 of the ipcc scenarios so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling
1177308 the producer limited profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070
1177309 a change of that magnitude is more than we have seen in 20 million years
1177310 if we had wanted to destroy as much of life on earth as possible there would have been no better way of doing it than to dig up and burn as much fossil hydrocarbon as we possible could

1177320 open your bible to deuteronomy and follow me while i read
1177321 moses proclaimed to the israelites all the lord had commanded him concerning them the lord our god said to us at horeb th en as the lord our god commanded us when the lord heard what you said he was angry and solemnly swore because of you the lord became angry with me also and said but the lord said to me
1177322 you see chris thats only the first chapter of deuteronomy and already the words you are reading have been given six times as the very words of god
1177323 in your soul you have sensed what the words really are and are really about youre afraid to see god youre afraid to know him thats why youre stuck in your journey you arent the fi rst but you have this few who read these words have any understanding of the awesome presence in which they stand you have felt the fire and seen the cloud dont turn back press on
1177324 moses spoke to all israel in the desert east of the jordan that is in the arabah opposite suph between paran and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab
1177325 moses proclaimed to the israelites all that the lord had commanded him concerning them
1177326 the technical term for what youve found chris is a chiasm its a concentric structure of music or text that can operate on any level from the few verses you are studying to the book of deuteronomy or the bible as a whole you can see the logic of it in an english translation the e poetry and music only come through fully in the hebrew th e liturgical churches understand intuitively at least something of this more than my own evangelical tradition truth and goodness are communicated through beauty the music and poetry of it awaken our sensitivity to meaning the holy spirit is not a hack writer i think youre ready to go on
1177327 why does god insert verse two in here hal the reference to the eleven days it takes to go from horeb to kadesh barnea seems out of place
1177328 is to contrast the ease of gods way with the difficulty of mans horeb is sinai where the law was given kadesh barnea was the place they were supposed to jump off for the promised land you are about to read that part of the story but the bottom line is that because of their lack of faith it took the israelites thirty eight years to make a trip they could have made in eleven days if they had followed the lords command his yoke is easy and his burden is light keep reading
1177329 you have stayed long enough at this mountain break camp and advance into the hill country of the amorites go to all the neighboring peoples in the arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the negev and along the coast to the land of the canaanites and to lebanon as far as the great river the euphrates see i have given you this land go in and take possession of the land that the lord swore he would give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob and to their descendants after them
1177330 how did you feel about education when you graduated from law school
1177331 and what does that have to do with the next three verses you are studying in deuteronomy
1177332 to bring his flock away from the mountain and lead them into acting on the promise i hear it in moses throughout deuteronomy and in paul when he says of himself when i became a man i put childish ways behind me and in the writer of hebrews when he scolds his readers for still living on milk like infants and not being ready for the solid food of maturity most people in the pew spend their life at the foot of the mountain being hearers of the word but not doers i used to plead with god to give me one congregation or one board of elders that could leave the mountain before my ministry was over but he never did there were some very deep and committed believers i knew over the years some who moved on spiritually to deeper levels and some who took possession of the promises god had laid out before them but if success in ministry means leading people beyond the elementary level ive been one of gods colossal failures as a servant
1177333 youre not ready to talk about what you think you know
1177334 the subject of government will come up in the text again and well talk about it then just read the rest of chapter one verses nineteen through forty six and the fi rst verse of chapter two
1177335 you have reached the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us see the lord your god has given you the land go up and take possession of it as the lord the god of your fathers told you do not be afraid do not be discouraged
1177336 let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to
1177337 it is a good land that the lord our god is giving us
1177338 th e lord hates us so he brought us out of egypt to deliver us into the hands of the amorites to destroy us
1177339 do not be terrified do not be afraid of them the lord your god who is going before you will fight for you as he did for you in egypt before your very eyes and in the desert there you saw how the lord your god carried you as a father carries his son all the way you went until you reached this place
1177340 not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land i swore to give your forefathers except caleb son of jephunneh he will see it and i will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on because he followed the lord wholeheartedly
1177341 you shall not enter it either but your assistant joshua son of nun will enter it encourage him because he will lead israel to inherit it and the little ones that you said would be taken captive your children who do not yet know good from bad they will enter the land i will give it to them and they will take possession of it but as for you turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea
1177342 we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight as the lord our god commanded us
1177343 tell them do not go up and fight because i will not be with you
1177344 i thought we should discuss this section somewhere that we could get a sense of journeys
1177345 watch the people going by think about what the journey is for each one where theyve been where theyre going now tomorrow next week
1177346 are not just travel in space th e journey of israel in this passage is a journey in space and in time like these people around us but more importantly it is the journey of the spiritual experience of the people it covers most of the wanderings before the entry into the land a period of thirty eight years and the experience of a failure of faith th ey have been brought out of the bondage of egypt led through hardship to the edge of plenty and promised success by the creator of the universe yet they refuse to go in blaming their unbelief on gods evil motives toward them although god saved them by bringing them out of egypt they claim he intends to destroy them at the hands of amorites although god loved them and carried them as a father carries his son they claim that he hates them its the psychological phenomenon of projection where a person attributes to another the same feeling that he or she has toward that person
1177347 at every turn they do the opposite of what he asks every time he shows them why they should have faith in him they are unfaithful then the consequences of their unbelief are brought to them he sends them back toward the desert and tells them they will not see the good land only their children will th is is in effect a death sentence to wander in that vast and dreadful desert for the rest of their lives faced with the consequence of their sin they repent and try to make it up by doing what theyre no longer commanded to do a further rebellion and the result is utter failure at every point they act contrary to god and the result is that the blessings are withheld and given to a generation that will accept them
1177348 is written with you the people to whom it is addressed in both the singular and plural the shift from addressing the individual to the group you occurs throughout the book often within discrete passages since both are translated simply you in english you dont see the difference in english bibles in biblical studies the technical term for this is the numeruswechsel both singular and plural you appear in this passage you dont need to remember the technical term but whats important is that the message is addressed to both the nation and to individuals
1177349 for you chris that means it is addressed to you personally and to every other individual human being but the heir to the israel of moses is not the modern state of israel nor the united states nor any other contemporary nation it is the church in the words of the apostles creed the holy catholic church the church universal the community of believers or at least those who associate together and profess to be believers
1177350 this would be a good time to talk a little bit about how we should interpret scripture well need to deal with this all the way along in our study together th e story we are reading now is first of all history and we can learn from its example
1177351 th is sounds like a literal understanding simple enough the bible tells a story the facts are true and there are lessons to be gained are there other ways of understanding it
1177352 beyond the literal historical sense and the moral or example we can take from that are the allegorical typological and anagogical senses of scripture th ese are not the same but people use the terms somewhat interchangeably and everyone doesnt always mean the same thing when they use them they must be used with care
1177353 whole stories or sections of scripture are sometimes seen as symbolic or fi gurative of something else ways of expressing truths about god and humanity stories that dont fi t well with our current human understanding such as the early chapters of genesis or the books of job or jonah are often seen as allegorical a great danger in allegory is that it can lead to fl ights of fancy where the true meaning of the scripture is lost in human imagining and we hear man and not god another danger is that allegorical interpretations become focused on words or worse numbers and find hidden meanings in the text that are supposedly known only to some inner circle this is the stuff that leads to cults
1177354 god does great things for them and they turn away from him afraid to follow his commands blaming him for their fears in the end they deserve only wilderness wanderings and death
1177355 particular historical events are seen as prefiguring or symbolizing something that comes to full significance in christ the crossing of the red sea prefigures baptism jonah prefigures the resurrection of christ typology is usually grounded in the scriptures themselves which often make these connections explicit jesus taught that the law of moses as well as the prophets and the psalmists all wrote of him so we are not off base in seeing these connections moses is a type of christ in many respects
1177356 in anagogical interpretation one finds beyond the literal moral allegorical or typological a spiritual and even mystical sense in which the scripture has eternal significance in leading believers to the true homeland the anagogical sense of scripture is better felt than taught its what comes from the depth of contemplating god in prayer and meditation in light of the scriptures when you understand scripture in an anagogical sense you will have gotten beyond the milk of elementary teachings and will be eating real spiritual meat
1177357 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure now after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the long term challenge of energy independence
1177358 in renewable fuels and batteries for fuel efficient cars help automakers re tool and make a real investment in renewable sources of energy
1177359 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1177360 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1177361 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1177362 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1177363 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1177364 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1177365 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1177366 its a good thing el oh el isnt working since the self destruct command can be issued from any comment string wait i wasnt supposed to tell you that

1177374 i dont think i have a place in history yet
1177375 i got elected to the u s senate i havent done anything yet
1177376 do your homework show up at committee meetings keep a low profile
1177377 you want to make everyone aware that youre a workhorse
1177378 now let the record show that senator obama has been here from the beginning of the hearing

1177396 consciousness does not need heeding from reality but confronting it uganda is not for politicians it is for us all and we have to stand to be counted and be responsible and productive in crafting a better uganda for ourselves and our next generation s to come the idea of posterity
1177397 do they think we fought in the bush to come here and play we the liberators of this country are still around where do they think our strength went they are telling lies and lies are unacceptable they will be stopped they will stop

1177402 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience racism
1177403 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1177404 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1177405 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion

1177411 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1177412 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1177413 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1177414 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1177415 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation

1177422 and i beheld that they were white and exceedingly fair and beautiful
1177423 and he had caused the cursing to come upon them yea even a sore cursing because of their iniquity for behold they had hardened their hearts against him that they had become like unto a flint wherefore as they were white and exceedingly fair and delightsome that they might not be enticing unto my people the lord god did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
1177424 and it came to pass that those lamanites who had united with the nephites were numbered among the nephites and their curse was taken from them and their skin became white like unto the nephites and their young men and their daughters became exceeding fair
1177425 o my brethren i fear that unless ye shall repent of your
1177426 shall i tell you the law of god in regard to the african race if the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of cain the penalty under the law of god is death on the spot this will always be so

1177429 when all the other children of adam have had the privilege of receiving the priesthood and of coming into the kingdom of god and of being redeemed from the four quarters of the earth and have received their resurrection from the dead then it will be time enough to remove the curse from cain and his posterity

1177448 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential

1177511 scholars veterans doctors the people on the front line of education foreign affairs health care and the economy have joined our campaign we stand together today with an unwavering sense of purpose and urgency to put america back on the right track
1177512 joan fitz gerald is the only candidate with the fortitude and courage to get america out of iraq and restore americas place in the world she understands the need to protect the constitution and restore dignity to our country
1177513 as clerk and recorder in jefferson county fitz gerald garnered a statewide reputation as a democratic leader who got things done as the first female president of the states senate fitz gerald worked tenaciously to get important legislation passed to get the states fiscal house in order and improve renewable energy in the state she has a proven record of working across the aisle her policy ideas are solid her goals for congress are clear the legislature she asserts is equal to the judicial and executive branches for the last few years congress has played second fiddle to the white house in our opinion fitz gerald is exactly the type of leader who can help bring back that crucial balance all three candidates have great policy stances on iraq renewable energy the economy transportation health care and education fitz gerald is the one to get it done
1177514 i am chairing joan campaign for congress because i am concerned about the future of our country there has never been a more urgent time to find the trim tab that turns our ship of state safely and in a new direction from my vantage point we now only have time for the best
1177515 as the woman responsible for the democratic takeover of the state senate in 2004 joan has walked through fire she deserves credit for getting colorado back on track i am convinced that both fitz gerald and heath will provide the leadership needed to build and pass a progressive agenda for our nation and our state
1177516 i will be proud to work with joan on the tough problems facing america the next congress will impact the direction of this country like few have ever before and we need joans leadership on issues like strengthening the middle class and our economy and ending the war in iraq
1177517 i served with joan in the state senate and i saw first hand her leadership ability she led the fight against the republican redistricting effort and for a renewable energy requirement
1177518 i strongly support joan fitz gerald for congress with her record of accomplishment and experience in colorado she will hit the ground running in congress
1177519 as former chairs of the boulder county democratic party we know all of the candidates in the 2nd congressional district primary personally
1177520 pda believes that joan fitz gerald has demonstrated her ability to be an effective legislator and that she is the best candidate at this time to represent cd2 in the house fitz gerald has shown she is better prepared and disposed to protect the public sector than the other two candidates
1177521 she is endorsed by every major labor union in colorado because she has been a champion for working families during her term as the first woman president of the colorado state senate she always supported unions and has opposed right to work for less throughout her entire career joan has been a hero to working families and has always fought for the middle class
1177522 joan fitz gerald is adamantly opposed to constitutional overreaches by the bush cheney administration we know of no one who would be a protector of our personal freedoms that joan fitz gerald

1177530 years ago my boss told me that the purpose of a cover letter is to get them interested in looking at your resume the purpose of the resume is to get them interested enough to invite you in for an interview the interview is where you get the job
1177531 just like you wouldnt pick someone off the street and assume you establish a strong friendship with them you shouldnt pick a mentor off a page and expect to have a good mentoring relationship people are fickle you may not like person you end up with then theres the fact that this stranger has no allegiance to you do they really care about your development or do they want something that looks good on their resume the key to mentorships is not to look too hard or to think too much about it a contrived relationship will rarely develop into the lasting partnership that a naturally developed mentorship can provide just like any other relationship a mentoring partnership takes time and effort on both parts

1177539 but if anybody ever asks you have you ever watched somebody see their dream come true in real time
1177540 those were real tears it hits me in a very real way because this is what ive dreamed about since i was a very little girl ive been lucky enough to be on broadway and ive played wonderful parts but this show is something very sacred and special to me so im very emotional about it
1177541 im always the first to crack im such a baby but i think were all very overwhelmed by the response we love it that people are loving it and we will forever be stunned by that that what we have loved other people are enjoying and that is amazing
1177542 im just trying to breathe and not forget it im not a kid ive been working hard in this business for a long time so i appreciate this very much im just trying to take it all in and store it in my head forever because i may not get another moment like it
1177543 usually i let it go once the curtain comes down i try to stand in character until then then i let go i was a mess three nights ago we have different nights all the time itll hit us in different ways on different nights you never know whos going to tip over
1177544 we kept trying to talk each other down and say tonight lets just communicate with each other let us enjoy lets try to tell the story lets try not to spazz out as one is wont to do on an occasion such as this so at the beginning of the play we were a little spastic but we calmed down a little bit and had a wonderful time
1177545 they sure did i was a little baby kitten they just picked me up by the scruff of the neck and just lifted me out of the corporate experience
1177546 now i work 30 hours a week at my day job its a little more flexible and a little less frantic in both places i work with people i love so its great
1177547 that was astounding but this is my first time with something i wrote to be on broadway is one thing to be on broadway with your best friends doing something you believe in so much and want to share is something else i couldnt be prouder its been amazing every night

1177583 i wanted it to be moving inspiring and thought provoking
1177584 this record is cinematic like the soundtrack to an epic film that has yet to be made and then it goes beyond and has these high energy driving melodies that are not only exciting to listen to but also to perform live
1177585 at that point i had never played with an orchestra before i had only written for piano after within i saw the possibilities of working with orchestrators and programmers and my whole creative world opened up i wrote the songs on beyond knowing that i would have the instrumentation i love plus ive grown a lot in the last four years and i really feel like ive figured out what my sound is and how to take whats in my head and put it on the album
1177586 most people when they sit down to write have a specific story or experience to write about
1177587 when i sit down its purely about the music i focus on the emotion and the melody then go back and think about what this story is telling me
1177588 if someone asked me what my music sounds like i would play them beyond
1177589 making this album took me on a journey through all these feelings that i feel romantic hopeful excited intense and i hope anyone who listens can relate and go on that journey with me
1177590 four years of having these songs in my head and thinking if we only had an orchestra finally i could hear what had existed only on paper for so long i have to say i was totally blown away it was such an emotional experience that words cannot describe it but ill never forget it
1177591 david looked at me and said play something and i felt my heart skip a beat because i knew who he was and that this was my moment my big chance and everything i had worked for
1177592 so im playing this song id written being backed by this world class band with david waving his hands in the air leading it all and im thinking please dont mess up now we finish everybody started applauding and david gave me a high five it was like a scene from a movie
1177593 william sat down and played this beautiful piece magnificently and to perfection
1177594 i was so impressed i asked him if he would perform that evening a standing ovation later and i knew i had to work with him
1177595 not only do i want to take people on a musical journey but i want to connect with them and hear what they think which is why i love meeting people after the shows the fans are as much a part of this as everything else and i take that connection with them very seriously in the end i just want to bring as many people along with me on this adventure as possible

1177604 there were concerns expressed and this was early in the year

1177626 tyson foods at the very maximum should have only allowed their muslim employees to take one unpaid day off to celebrate and thats it
1177627 why is the muslim religion being catered to and fawned over all the time in this country
1177628 so when 58 of any company decides something then it must be acepted right
1177629 and like clockwork the same bleeding hearts put aside their hatred for all things religious when it involves the poor muslims
1177630 union leaders said implementing the holiday was important for the nearly 700 muslims many of them somalis who work at the plant that employs a total of 1 200 people
1177631 look at great britain and the muslim mess that country has become
1177632 you know for the fuck of it what would be the liberal response had this company been 58 white supremicists and they decided that hitlers b day was the day they wanted off
1177633 the muslims only think they arent being allowed to be absorbed
1177634 as for france it was all muslims who torched 5000 cars in paris and set a handicapped person on fire during the muslim riots
1177635 this is our country you should be grateful youre here and we have no intention of changing all our our laws customs heritage and beliefs only to satisfy you

1177646 if you read page 10 they actually do mention the war from time to time
1177647 everybody knows that captain america was a science experiment from world war ii my friend bob morales joked that cap would probably have been the first white solider in history that the military ever experimented on without testing it out on a black guy first

1177662 its uncool to have your heroes get into fist fights now there are whole issues of the justice league where they just stand around and talk and hug and cry am i joking
1177663 the reason im at fox right now is that i can actually name a fox cartoonist and its the only place where the guy that creates the carton can actually get rich

1177711 theres a big difference between putting words over some music and blending those same words into the music theres not a lot of humour they use a lot of slang and colloquialisms and you dont really see inside the person instead you just get a lot of posturing
1177712 they will all hate you for doing the right thing but someone has to do it
1177713 we arent against mormonism but romney is not a thoroughgoing evangelical and his flip flopping on issues is understandable in a liberal state like massachusetts but our people wont understand that
1177714 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1177715 althouse is a bit confusing at times in class but she tries really hard to get her students to grasp the important concepts while her exams are usually closed book creating confusion and fear for students studying for her final this ends up being better for the student in the end i would definately take her again

1177721 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1177722 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1177723 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1177724 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1177725 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1177726 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1177727 cable operators would no longer need to provide a unique piece of hardware for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality
1177728 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1177729 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1177730 agreed on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
1177731 the resistance cooperates with the army so that resistance weapons would have the freedom to defend the terrain and resist israel
1177732 when we accepted this policy statement we approved it as a whole and we hope it would be fully applied but experience tells us that the policy statement in lebanon is mere headlines
1177733 deals within the framework of partnership and cooperation and we have over passed the past and i believe that this policy statement has outlined the governments role
1177734 this mornings events were not a terror attack they were the act of a sovereign state that attacked israel without reason and without provocation the government of lebanon of which hizbullah is a part is attempting to destabilize the region lebanon is the responsible party and lebanon will pay the consequences for its actions

1177740 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1177741 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1177742 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1177743 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1177744 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1177745 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign

1177758 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done

1177760 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1177761 that might lead to various distress responses one of which on the part of women is having transactional sex to feed their kids

1177922 the new system which was legislated for late last year will enable inland revenue to know when child support debtors enter or leave the country which will be a useful tool that will complement existing enforcement measures
1177923 new zealand customs will check names provided by inland revenue against the arrival and departure information it holds and when a match occurs it will give the relevant information to inland revenue
1177924 having information on the arrival of parents with outstanding child support debt even for short visits will make it possible for inland revenue to contact them to arrange payment if necessary inland revenue can also take legal steps to prevent them subsequently leaving the country
1177925 child support debt is now over 1 billion a figure that is too high but must be viewed in context about two thirds of that debt is penalties for late payment that have compounded over the years
1177926 in the year to june inland revenue collected 367 million in child support payments

1177939 we dont have any studies that show prostate cancer screening saves lives
1177940 there is no benefit to prostate cancer screening and we dont recommend it
1177941 my bottom line as a urologist is that healthy men with a life expectancy of more than 10 years regardless of their age should continue to be screened for prostate cancer yearly
1177942 i really dont think these new recommendations are going to change practice patterns
1177943 unequivocally all men at risk of prostate cancer must be tested annually with no exceptions
1177944 by redirecting thought towards mary as the proposed spiritual mother of all humanity rome is attempting to draw islam within her skirts
1177945 an antidote to the challenges facing the church and society today is the glorification of mary through the proclamation of a fifth marian dogma
1177946 mary has through private revelations like those at lourdes fatima etc made known that in the sad situations of the world today god wishes as an antidote the glorification of his mother through the recitation of the holy rosary devotion to the immaculate heart of mary etc
1177947 the fifth marian dogma would certainly improve the world situation through the prayers of mary to her divine son many believe that the danger of marxist communism was averted by the apparitions of mary at lourdes fatima etc and the consequent increase in devotion to mary
1177948 the greatest threat that the catholic church faces today is consumerist relativism that has greatly affected the western church and even the churches in asia i believe that it can be overcome by honoring our lady with the proposed dogma
1177949 not only will the solemn definition never hurt the ecumenical movement but it will positively enhance it i feel that it is gods will that we should honor our lady in a special way at this juncture of world history

1177971 you have modestly expressed a desire to know whether those who have recently died in war fighting in defence of the church of god and for the preservation of the christian religion and of the state or those who may in the future fall in the same cause may obtain indulgence for their sins
1177972 we confidently reply that those who out of love to the christian religion shall die in battle fighting bravely against pagans or unbelievers shall receive eternal life
1177973 in whatever hour a sinner shall be converted i will remember his sins no longer

1177976 we must make everyone understand that the basilica was not built here because of a whim but because it has a history underneath that has been preserved protected with extreme scruple and it is the history of the apostle peter
1177977 peter came to rome here he met with martyrdom during neros persecution then he was taken by christians because roman law allowed the recovery of bodies of the condemned to give them burial
1177978 peter was brought to the point where at present the papal altar is erected he was buried there and we can say that for 2 000 years that site is the justification of the presence of the bishop of rome next to the tomb of peter that is of the pope
1177979 we can almost touch with our hand the tomb where the first christians of rome placed the body of the apostle peter
1177980 one can see extremely clearly around the place of peters burial a whole series of testimonies of devotion to the apostle in that precise point for example the most famous inscription in greek
1177981 it is an indisputably established historical fact that st peter laboured in rome during the last portion of his life and there ended his earthly course in martyrdom as to the duration of his apostolic activity in the roman capital the continuity or otherwise of his residence there the details and success of his labours and the chronology of his arrival and death all these questions are uncertain and can be solved only on hypotheses more or less well founded the essential fact is that peter died at rome this constitutes the historical foundation of the claim of the bishops of rome to the apostolic primacy of peter
1177982 the precise date at which the roman church was founded we do not know nor the date at which st peter first went to rome but it is universally the tradition of this primitive christianity that st peter ruled the roman church and that at rome he gave his life for christ in the persecution of nero
1177983 about the origins of christianity in rome we know nothing it is already a flourishing church in 56 ad when st paul refers to it three years later he arrived in rome himself a prisoner for the hearing of his appeal to caesar
1177984 st peter first appeared there apparently some three years later about the time st paul acquitted had left the city
1177985 the historical foundation of the claims of the bishops of rome among the best ascertained facts in history
1177986 for that ye strove in neighbour love it shall be written fair but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for you for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
1177987 i invite the whole church to share in this new stage of the great pilgrimage of young people across the world begun in 1985 by the servant of god john paul ii
1177988 i am certain that from all the corners of the earth catholics will be united with me and with all the young people gathered as in the cenacle in sydney intensely invoking the holy spirit so that he will flood hearts with the inner light of love of god and of brothers and of courageous initiative to introduce jesus eternal message in the diversity of languages and cultures
1177989 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
1177990 this is the promise jesus made to his disciples after the resurrection and which remains always valid and actual in the church the holy spirit awaited and received in prayer infuses in believers the capacity to be witnesses of jesus and his gospel
1177991 blowing on the churchs sail the divine spirit pushes her to go into the deep always anew from generation to generation to take to everyone the good news of the love of god revealed fully in jesus christ dead and resurrected for us
1177992 in past months the young peoples cross has been taken all over oceania and in sydney it will be once again a silent witness of the pact of alliance between the lord jesus christ and the new generations
1177993 icon of the virgin mary accompanies the world youth days we entrust to her maternal protection this trip to australia and the meeting with young people in sydney
1177994 after the crucifixion when our lady moved to the home of st john she took with her a few personal belongings among which was a table built by the redeemer in the workshop of st joseph when pious virgins of jerusalem prevailed upon st luke to paint a portrait of the mother of god it was the top of this table that was used to memorialize her image while applying his brush and paints st luke listened carefully as the mother of jesus spoke of the life of her son facts which the evangelist later recorded in his gospel legend also tells us that the painting remained in and around jerusalem until it was discovered by st helena in the fourth century together with other sacred relics the painting was transported to constantinople where her son emperor constantine the great erected a church for its enthronement
1177995 for that ye strove in neighbour love it shall be written fair but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for you for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
1177996 a new age in which hope liberates us from the shallowness apathy and self absorption which deaden our souls and poison our relationships
1177997 a n otherwise private person acts under color of state law when engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive another of federal rights
1177998 i think that working with computers that do not use any hard drive is the way prevent the government from having a chance to look at client files computers can be booted with customized versions of knoppix and from there can access the internet using ssl and do everything we would expect them to do
1177999 from my perspective the key part is figuring out where the drugs came from and who should be held accountable for that
1178000 the fcc to clarify that an internet service provider violates the fccs internet policy statement when it intentionally degrades a targeted internet application
1178001 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
1178002 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
1178003 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
1178004 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
1178005 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1178006 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1178007 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1178008 he knew all of the key players surrounding and protecting al qaeda
1178009 he knew that terror was going to occur before it happened
1178010 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened mizer said
1178011 hamdan had no previous knowledge of the operation or any other one
1178012 he is fit to change trucks tyres change oil filters wash and clean cars
1178013 enduring fail proof operation in dull dangerous and dirty scenarios
1178014 by lowering the nominal value of shares the affordability of the shares to retail investors will be increased and in addition it will act as a deterrent to market predators
1178015 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1178016 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1178017 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1178018 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1178019 an immediate work program is planned and it is the companys intention to rapidly generate iron oxide copper gold drill targets in the gregory project area north of mt isa
1178020 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1178021 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1178022 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1178023 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1178024 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1178025 when richard was appointed in october 2002 the companys shares were trading at just 21 cents and production capacity and gas reserves were zero whereas today we see quite a different picture
1178026 participating in these engagements when you know full well that you hold the position as a result of an act of treason is for me questionable
1178027 him having the audacity to do those six trips in the last seven months goes to show that the actions he took was to benefit himself
1178028 in any case the sale of the banking business seems quite unlikely
1178029 we think that suncorps management likes to picture suncorp as a bank with insurance operations rather than an insurer with banking operations
1178030 such mentality is in our view unlikely to change under the current leadership
1178031 so whilst this is all a handy fall back position that must mitigate some of the risks evident in the economic and company specific backdrop it seems unlikely to eventuate
1178032 in the medium and the longer term they are well chosen deliberate buybacks which will provide once we get some water into the system the type of relief the river does need
1178033 theres no water there for farmers theres no water there for irrigators theres very little water there for the buybacks
1178034 were committed to making sure that we do start to get some water into the river system to help the environment but the fact is that particularly with some of these licences at this point in time theres a shortage of water
1178035 all they did was buy the cheapest water they could to make it look like theyve got the 35 gigalitres theyre aiming for which cant be delivered
1178036 over 40 per cent of what they bought this year was in the lachlan river or north and it never flows into the murray river system except once every 50 years
1178037 down the bottom in the murrumbidgee and the murray the water they bought was general security and there is no general security for irrigators at the moment
1178038 over us 20 a barrel drop that should have translated into a much greater drop in the price of petrol at the bowsers
1178039 i found this amusing they were saying biggest drop theyd seen in four years
1178040 it should have been more theyre patting themselves on the back but theyre still ripping motorists off
1178041 i think were going to see petrol prices continue to go down
1178042 i think well go down to the lower 100s and that should see us with petrol prices back into the a1 20 per litre
1178043 but at the moment were still a few cents over what we should be
1178044 it was assumed petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1178045 we want to see a new campaign promoting destinations on the far south coast far north coast act and western nsw
1178046 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1178047 we agreed on the priority for the direction of cooperation energy mining agriculture transport health care and communications
1178048 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
1178049 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
1178050 i think it is the moment to bring that back
1178051 we have revived the process of forming a tripartite alliance that is based on what we have for several years been calling the main axis of south america caracas brasilia buenos aires
1178052 in tackling the future challenges in the areas of food supplies energy industry science technology
1178053 suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry

1178055 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1178056 i made a decision not to politicise the games this is for athletics
1178057 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1178058 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1178059 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
1178060 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion
1178061 if he is unable to get to advanced base camp tomorrow from where a helicopter can evacuate him then he might be sling lifted but this is a very technical operation and needs a lot of preparation
1178062 has some problems with his arms and legs due to freezing an attempt will be made tomorrow to rescue him
1178063 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
1178064 every expedition has lost at least one or two people
1178065 the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
1178066 carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
1178067 they were far from me hours away but they were not turning around
1178068 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1178069 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1178070 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1178071 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1178072 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1178073 we used a population sample that is more than two million times larger than the group studied earlier and confirmed the classic finding
1178074 we believe that we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident and capable of hosting a peaceful and safe games
1178075 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1178076 to view chinese government accounts regarding uighur terrorist acts with caution as government authorities consistently fail to provide evidence to back up their claims
1178077 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1178078 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1178079 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs
1178080 its a big one its someones livelihood i think hes had enough chances and to go down this track it just takes it over the edge so i would think maybe yes
1178081 i think just the protectionism that eddies trying to give his club to save the image in fact is detrimental to the very thing youre trying to build and thats the culture
1178082 he mcguire loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it
1178083 well its four times in the last two years that this has happened they arent handling it well at all
1178084 next year that didak comes up oh no well change that now we think its detrimental to the team and you shouldnt impact the players
1178085 well its like i said you make your bed you lie in it
1178086 you will get some people that we cant be with them every minute of the day while theyre making their decisions and all we can do is we can give them the support prior and we can make them accountable afterwards and they have to deal with the consequences
1178087 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1178088 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1178089 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1178090 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1178091 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1178092 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1178093 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1178094 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1178095 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1178096 if a prostitute gives you a candy bar for a hundred dollars then gives you the sex for free it is still prostitution
1178097 it was an attempt to go around the law but its not a very good attempt to go around the law because its still not legal
1178098 the guy we asked him repeatedly many times is this perfectly legal he said yes yes this is perfectly legal
1178099 we make good products with eye catching packaging that customers really like bottom line
1178100 our products are fun sexy high quality and most importantly affordable this is a great opportunity for an experienced sales person familiar with our industry
1178101 we are very excited about this new relationship with hustler and are looking forward to a great partnership moving forward
1178102 when i heard about the product it cracked me up when i saw it for myself i knew that it was a must have for our stores we look forward to a successful product launch with the pussywhip
1178103 something totally new totally unique and totally tough with brutal sex
1178104 i was a thai boxer for many years and had one ongoing fantasy my fantasy was defeating a man in a rough sweaty competition and my prize is him becoming my sex slave doing whatever i want however i want it and while doing so making him a stronger warrior
1178105 obviously with the tough straight men i was fighting my fantasy never came to be finally i have found the team and the cast to fulfill my fantasies our cast is strong rough and tough and has real martial arts experience these men are up for the fight and enjoy the reward of punishment
1178106 our driving principle is about more than the products we offer its about the experience and the lifestyle we aim to release your sexuality and be in touch with it sinless touch will cater to everything you need
1178107 all of these features solidify the companys commitment to delivering an enjoyable and rewarding experience sinless touch has raised the bar and competition will be hard pressed to catch up
1178108 glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us
1178109 i dont think its right i really dont think its right
1178110 this isnt a religious accommodation this is a contractual agreement the majority asked for it
1178111 i think its fine i dont have any problem with it theres a whole bunch of them here so theyve got to do something for them
1178112 physicians should use esas with caution based on the international guidelines for esa administration in cancer and on certain prognostic indicators to guide their use physicians need to identify the appropriate group of cancer patients who will benefit from esa administration while avoiding possible detrimental effects
1178113 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1178114 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1178115 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1178116 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1178117 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1178118 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1178119 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1178120 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1178121 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1178122 i can make that how hard can it be i can sew peasant tops and trousers and shirred dresses the vintage coat was sewn entirely by hand and i have a machine right
1178123 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least
1178124 the reason i used christians really is because everyone around me that i know pretty much comes from a christian background
1178125 when i look at muslims i see pretty much a minority in this country and i dont really like picking on the little guy
1178126 while trahan said the film is a parody he insisted there is some truth to the idea that christians can be terrorists
1178127 stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of the major media outlets

1178230 i hated opera i really wanted to do music theatre my dad was a plumber we were from a very humble background but it was in me that fire to sing i had that fire in my belly
1178231 and after the first year i listened to joan sutherland sing an aria from la sonnambula and i went i love this she made me cry and i started mimicking i was a pretty good mimic but i soon realised youve got to have technique to back that up
1178232 in 2000 i blitzed the competitions and one of those happened to be for the met for four years
1178233 i was thrilled its still a shock that i got there and a wonderful blessing and i learned a lot and am still learning a lot every day
1178234 i definitely like to delve deep into the psychology of the character but at the same time you dont want to be onstage thinking too much because then the audience picks up on that youve really got to have a clear cut idea of your character
1178235 but at the same time you cant turn them into a caricature because then it doesnt make sense in the opera its laughable and the music isnt
1178236 we quite literally were a greek chorus we stand there and sing so that was a very different experience
1178237 i was very very happy to be part of that and it is extremely difficult to sing at one point in the production there were 60 a flats in a row so that really showed a lot of stamina that i could get through it as i said im always learning and after that show there was no illness i was able to sing every night i was very proud of myself because its one of the most difficult parts a soprano can be given the soprano in a philip glass opera and he was there and very complimentary
1178238 its in sanskrit its repetitive you dont know where you are coming in and at one point they discussed not having a prompter
1178239 theres a top a i had to sing and i came in a bit early and i couldnt start and then come off because it looks like a mistake so i held this a for about four bars before everyone came in and that was a moment where i hadnt looked at the prompter
1178240 durkin in particular thrillingly dominates an act two ensemble with her repeated series of push button high flying phrases
1178241 were all affected by reviews and what people think of us all the time and its horrible constantly searching out the negative instead of the positive and that doesnt do the performance any good
1178242 the reason i got into the met in the first place was because of my attitude
1178243 its great to be singing and thats what i love to do some people sing but they dont love to sing and when you lose that people notice
1178244 what is really important is to be happy in what you are doing even if that means saying no to a role thats too big or a role that you think doesnt suit you its better to do that than live with regrets once you lose that love you may as well forget it

1178246 another spoiler jonathan john hannah winds up with the artifact in this film and he doesnt realize nor do we what its powers are in my mind that artifact still has a lot of prizes in it the eye of shangri la this big diamond
1178247 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel
1178248 now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures
1178249 they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found
1178250 so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story

1178265 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game and then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to say

1178282 much more likely than other people to desire a life in which they make a difference in the world 75 compared to the national average of 56
1178283 adults who define themselves as christian but are not born again constitute about half of the population that embraces the christian label
1178284 less than half as likely to say that being active in a church was very desirable 32 were one third less likely to list having a close personal relationship with god as very desirable 65 and were only half as likely to portray being deeply committed to the christian faith as very desirable 46
1178285 protestants were significantly more likely than catholics to say it would be very desirable to be personally active in a church 60 vs 41 respectively
1178286 the data provide a distinct image of each faith group
1178287 evangelicals are intensely driven by their faith their life is substantially influenced by their beliefs and their lifestyle choices and aspirations reflect the centrality of their spirituality non evangelical born again adults consider faith to be important but it is not the defining aspect of their existence it is influential but not the determining factor notional christians treat faith as just one of many dimensions of their life that serves a purpose but it is not a driving force at all skeptics have replaced faith with a passion for healthy longevity and personal pleasure gained through world travel sexual experiences and obtaining knowledge they are substantially less focused on relationships and legacy than are other groups they tend to be less concerned about finding or pursuing a purpose in life because a majority of them believe life has no purpose beyond comfort and pleasure
1178288 there is a central idea merely practicing is not understanding seek to understand the human ability study diligently for deep ideas the result after a long time is that one is able to know

1178299 regrettably ed cannot personally respond to most comments and questions
1178300 heres my main concern now that multi site has become the next big thing will people take the time to do it well or will they simply set up theaters with videos often what multi site becomes is one prominent pastor projecting his image into another town without a missiological or evangelistic strategy accompanying it
1178301 im not a theologically driven critic of multi site im a critic of it done poorly if you dont think this through and you dont have the right motives you end up with a baby that grows up to be pretty ugly
1178302 the problem is when people equate it to church with online baptisms and that kind of stuff
1178303 you have to assemble and that requires feet not electrons
1178304 i think i will love it more if reproduction is the goal reproducing believers ministries groups and churches

1178306 and the word of god continued to increase and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in jerusalem
1178307 began rejoicing and glorying in the word of the lord and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed and the word of the lord was spreading throughout the whole region
1178308 the the word of the lord continued to increase and prevail mightily
1178309 the word of the lord may speed ahead and be honored as happened among you
1178310 personally i want to find a way that is both biblically faithful and missiologically sound

1178313 to work with wisdom born from the word history culture and missiology are important things in the ministry of a local church and in general to our endeavors for the spread of the gospel but biblically i wonder how this plays out
1178314 what are you doing hes done hes finished get him outta there
1178315 am i ready to wrestle the wild animal of making changes until the job is done
1178316 respond to the changing environment by working harder to make their dominant habits programs and actions effective
1178317 we dont really need to change we just need to work harder at what we are already doing
1178318 first one must become aware that the challenges are no longer routine and cant be addressed by the methods and assumptions of the performative zone
1178319 tom landry the coach of the dallas cowboys defined coaching as making men do what they dont want so they can become what they want to be an apt description of the pastoral task is to call people to do what they dont want so they can become what they want to be
1178320 one challenge of revitalizing a small church is getting older people to understand the need for change one major key for us has been the willingness of our older generation members to change and accept change we began doing things differently like making young people a key focus of the church if it hadnt been for the willingness of those older members we might be declining or already dead
1178321 one of the key things to our growth has been the change in our leaders attitudes about their spiritual growth
1178322 they have come to a point where they participate in weekly bible studies together as well as participating in group discipleship studies one particular example of leaders coming from the laity has occurred in our youth group we have a couple that has stepped up and become key mentors chaperones and whatever else we need them to be to our youth also when we began our building program we had two guys who are contractors give resources and time to help with the cost of the building they had never done anything like that before

1178330 mi impresi n es que vamos a ir en proyectos separados en las elecciones municipales y regionales creo que el escenario nacional el 2011 en todas las tiendas pol ticas requiere de una revisi n bien de fondo y tampoco hay que tirarse un portazo hay que dejar las puertas abiertas para ver qu cosa se hace

1178348 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1178349 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1178350 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1178351 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1178352 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1178353 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1178354 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1178355 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1178356 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job

1178804 thanks to the struggle and the work of the argentine forensic anthropology team we were able to bring back a face name and history of struggle for our dear mar a angelica today we can say mar a angelica disappeared social activist disappeared for believing that our country had to be more just we can say mar a angelica youre present now and forever
1178805 the identification of the disappeared also gives objective evidence to the courts in the trials of those responsible for these crimes
1178806 we want to know what happened to each one of the victims we want the people who organized this slaughter to be put in regular jails with life sentences
1178807 i thought we were going to take part in beijing but it says here beljing
1178808 we want for those who participated in genocide to be put in jail today theres one more in prison this should force us to continue to bring every person who participated in the genocide in the clandestine detention centers and supported genocide to justice justice which we the survivors didnt have that the 30 000 disappeared didnt have
1178809 after the disappearance of jorge julio lopez we were afraid whether we could continue with the trials even though the witnesses are afraid it is important to continue with the trials to end with the impunity
1178810 the sacrament of confession or reconciliation gives men the opportunity to eradicate their hearts of evil we the priests of the catholic church can use the sacrament and share it with this sacrament and in 2 000 years in the history of the church no priest from the roman catholic church ever violated this sacrament
1178811 von wernich is responsible for all the disappeared from the clandestine detention centers where he worked he wasnt only guilty in collaborating in the kidnapping torture and killing of people but directly participating in the crimes especially torturing his job was to break the witnesses down and get more information from detainees during and after torture sessions
1178812 christian von wernich is one of the spokesmen from the church that participated in the torture and comforted disappeared detainees
1178813 come on son confess everything so they stop torturing you
1178814 these lefties died because of their virgin minds that were indoctrinated
1178815 today is the fruit of 30 years of struggle today because the amnesty laws were revoked we are able to put von wernich on trial for me today is a strong blow because i have a disappeared son who was in seminary school so i have a contradiction of what the church meant not only was there impunity but the church remained silent
1178816 for practicing catholics we have entered an identity crisis today i couldnt sit and listen to von wernich i thought of my son and the years i lost praying
1178817 what we want is for the trials to speed up a little bit and not be tried on a case by case basis and that the government takes responsibility to help end the threats against witnesses judges and lawyers so that we can really say that theres justice in this country
1178818 rights violation of u s workers right to freedom of association
1178819 we appreciate our jobs but we also want to make it clear that wal mart abuses workers rights we demand that those abuses cease and that firings for union activities stop behind closed doors wal mart violated argentinas constitution and it employs corporate practices that discriminate against workers
1178820 concern over the working conditions and persecution of union activists in wal mart argentina
1178821 the wal mart stores have affiliated personnel secondly the company currently has 31 active union delegates third far from not having unions in our company two unions operate retail and truck drivers
1178822 after all of our reports of accusations wal mart in avelleneda doesnt want to fire any workers out of fear but the company continues to hold meetings with workers telling them they are associates telling them that wal mart is the best place to work in the world wal mart is known for persecuting its workers because wal mart doesnt want its workers to organize
1178823 we have not had any formal notification from the judicial system that saint jean is connected to any crime
1178824 when i was hired at wal mart they asked me what my mother and father did for a living they investigated my police record i dont understand how this man with a position as important as head of security could be hired at wal mart with his background
1178825 rights violation of u s workers right to freedom of association
1178826 what would it hurt if i reapplied one more time to byu
1178827 dude ill go with you if you want to run away
1178828 how did the idea of an animated star wars movie come about george lucas the interesting thing about the clone wars is that in the normal course of the six star wars the clone wars was intriguing to me because it really allows us to tell other stories show other jedi introduce new characters and even tell stories about the clones themselves some of them have very interesting stories it allows us to broaden the canvas of what star wars is about dave filoni one of the things that has always surprised me is how many stories there are to tell in what seems like a small amount of time the period between episodes ii and iii was only about three years but we can tell so many new stories and meet new characters and go new places places i never imagined we could
1178829 the seven network moves into the final months of the current television year well placed to continue to build on its competitive performance in audience delivery and advertising revenue
1178830 pacific magazines has delivered a market leading performance across key publishing categories over the past 12 months with the company approaching a 30 per cent share of overall readership in the magazine market up from just under 24 per cent 12 months ago
1178831 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world microsoft researcher eric horvitz said
1178832 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1178833 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network the researchers wrote in a paper detailing their work
1178834 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1178835 6 degrees of separation premise stems from an oft cited 1969 study by stanley milgram and jeffrey travers
1178836 we used a population sample that is more than two million times larger than the group studied earlier and confirmed the classic finding mr horvitz and mr leskovec concluded
1178837 the combination of falling employment confidence and rising inflation expectations is a lethal cocktail for consumer spending
1178838 the survey shows that consumers are bracing themselves for the worst when it comes to the squeeze on the household purse should the monetary policy committee be forced to increase rates over the months ahead then at least this will come as no surprise to consumers and limit any negative reaction
1178839 a very detailed plan to kill his co workers because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory
1178840 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1178841 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1178842 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1178843 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again
1178844 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised by who not a bureaucrat a senior doctor
1178845 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 per cent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1178846 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumours normal cells were unaffected
1178847 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1178848 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumours
1178849 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1178850 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 per cent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1178851 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumours the ascorbate injections reduced tumour growth and weight by 41 to 53 per cent
1178852 provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1178853 we have solid data to show that the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1178854 gorilla meat chimpanzee meat and meat of other apes fetches a higher price than beef chicken or fish
1178855 if you took all the individuals of the top 25 most endangered species and assigned each of them a seat they probably wouldnt fill a football stadium
1178856 we have solid data to show that the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1178857 comes out in the u k soon their street date of september 1 is way early and will surely be different stateside the movie doesnt come until october 30 here but presumably the tracklist will be the same given that its coming out on the universal music group label
1178858 and the soundtrack showcases ritchies inclination towards eclectic mostly british sounds both retro and cutting edge from his favorite genres dub the scientists
1178859 brought dishonor to the church to poor people and to human rights
1178860 we dont have anything to negotiate with them because the bauen is ours and its going to be ours even if they dont like it
1178861 im leon gieco and ive come to defend this cause because i consider that this is a genuine and natural source of jobs i support the recuperated enterprises because they are showing that people simply want to continue to work
1178862 the workers took on responsibility when the country was in full crisis and unemployment over 20 percent where workers couldnt find work the workers formed a cooperative and created jobs when no one believed that it was possible
1178863 bauen is a symbol of resistance and an example of creativity in society at the bauen they have invented a way of managing a business successfully this proves that a non capitalist form of management is viable in a society that has been in crisis
1178864 its difficult for a cooperative to become viable without capital resources and state subsidies
1178865 they built this hotel for the world cup in 1978 it became a symbol for the 1976 1983 military dictatorship when businessmen did whatever they wanted to with the working class by disappearing thousands of workers
1178866 this hotel was a symbol of the dictatorship of the repression and looting that this country endured now this hotel is a symbol of the workers the workers that are beginning to recover from 30 000 disappearances and take back what was taken from us
1178867 had to sleep on cement factory floors eat only rice and live in poverty for more than a year to save our jobs
1178868 during my 20 years working at this company i got to know the bosses well for us negotiation has been a bad word and much more right now we dont have to negotiate with them because the bauen is ours even if the bosses dont like it
1178869 as the president said they are representing themselves and it is the name of fiji which we will uphold at all times and that was his message to the delegation
1178870 he really really felt for this partially blind athlete who is going to take part in the paralympics he also wished him well and said that he was pleased to see someone who despite his disabilities is going to compete
1178871 the workers took on responsibility when the country was in full crisis and unemployment over 20 percent where workers couldnt find work the workers formed a cooperative and created jobs when no one believed that it was possible
1178872 socially we have proved to the people that workers can run a business this is one of our main motives because people believe that the capitalists are the only ones who can run a business and we are proving the contrary especially since weve created 150 jobs
1178873 they didnt have to throw us out into the streets on december 28 2001 because the hotel had enough business but the businessmen allowed the hotel to go to ruins and we had to leave we have renovated the hotel and successfully opened up a hotel that was closed now that they see that the hotel is successful they want to take it away from us
1178874 without the bauen our internal union commission wouldnt have formed
1178875 mercoteles is a ghost company when i worked at the hotel under bosses there were many sneaky administrative changes we had many bosses that changed on a regular basis
1178876 we believe that fighting within the legal system isnt enough thats why we are prepared to fight in the streets where we are stronger
1178877 we ask social organizations to take on the fight for bauen as a fight of their own because the bauen hotel belongs to the people
1178878 it was an operation to retrieve stolen goods and the police came under fire
1178879 this is a massive week for markets theyre going to be pulled all over the place
1178880 hsbc today was a reasonable set of numbers i think theyve done well to expose themselves to the fast growing emerging markets but clearly its showing you the problems in the us
1178881 i cant see where impulses for a further recovery could come from she said
1178882 it is fairly quiet at the moment i think this week will be driven mainly by news from the interest rate front she said
1178883 es que no puedo estar saliendo pensando en que me van a robar
1178884 no es el que compr despu s de que me asaltaron
1178885 the industry is at a crossroads with many farmers facing a myriad of issues affecting the way they do business but we need to find a way forward to ensure community demands dont continue to affect food production
1178886 we want to see sustainable environmental practices sustainable food production levels and also prosperous rural communities so farmers can continue to do what they do best
1178887 if thats the way parkes play than thats why they never win the comp
1178888 when youve got an injury toll like were getting it makes it tough
1178889 thats what footys about though and you have to roll with the punches
1178890 were still keeping the dream alive and itll give the younger generation a chance to step up
1178891 this will be a huge help to families especially families in rural areas that have had to cope with the drought it has been a real struggle for them
1178892 a lot of families have two parents working and this increase in the rebate will alleviate some of the financial burden on families
1178893 ive had a good run with the magpies it would have been nice to go out a winner but ill still be involved in the club
1178894 it wasnt all doom and gloom and the boys dug deep
1178895 first we need the department of local government to sign off on the ppp and we are not sure how long that may take because council has never been through this process of entering a public private partnership
1178896 we have engaged the community on this and they made it quite clear that they didnt want anyone other than council to take over the running of the facility
1178897 it has been a fantastic day as was last night when the club conducted their calcutta evening at the services memorial club
1178898 this is a very good meeting it has an excellent casual feel and the crowd in very good for a monday meeting they forbes are very lucky to have the support from the city wish we had it
1178899 to their credit they didnt give up and didnt put their heads down
1178900 sorry but im more rock n rolll than this new age of music for money
1178901 constantinople in its live version running on our myspace this was actualy recorded during our perfromance as support for oceansize but we have a youtube page too http www
1178902 were a trading nation as you know we depend on the ability of our exporters to access markets worldwide and in particular markets in emerging or developing economies
1178903 theres no doubt that this is a significant setback especially for our farmers and exporters given the economic benefits that they and canada as a whole stood to achieve from a positive outcome
1178904 these talks may have stalled at this time but we remain committed to more liberalized trade a rules based system and the overall objectives of the
1178905 the developed countries on the one side like have come to an agreement to accept these special safeguards but the threshold or the trigger levels need to be a little less protective than what the developing countries are looking for
1178906 the challenge is theres a number of extenuating circumstances around that including the
1178907 its going to be very very difficult to get them up and running again before this fall
1178908 i think the most significant thing we can do in the interim is begin a very aggressive program of bilaterals
1178909 we have a lot of room and a lot of opportunity to make bilateral agreements that can be beneficial to canadian agriculture
1178910 i think what you will see is whilst many countries will express what were expressing today that hopefully the talks can be revived sooner than later there will be many of us that will seriously engage toward bilaterals
1178911 we will push ahead with our trade agenda and our efforts to find more opportunities for our producers and exporters these talks may have stalled at this time but we remain committed to more liberalized trade a rules based system and the overall objectives of the negotiations in the meantime were going to be knocking on doors around the world to create new opportunities for our farmers and our exporters
1178912 i dont think theyve measured up in regards to getting other bilateral agreements signed as some of the other countries have a number of the other countries have gone ahead and signed bilateral agreements not waiting for wto to be the answer to all of their problems so i think
1178913 its just that we maybe havent been as quick out of the gate as some of the other countries
1178914 eh tolol kmn lw g kul lw pak imam nanyain lw mlu tuh ktanya ini adlah hr tindh dlm hidpnya hahaha
1178915 hey fuck emang udah ga ada acara yang ga ada bullshit nya yah
1178916 so i turn off my tv and start to write
1178917 there is one thing we know about meaning that meaning consists in attachment to something bigger than you are the self is not a very good site for meaning and the larger the thing that you can credibly attach yourself to the more meaning you get out of life
1178918 the objective of being useful is part of my general philosophy that our lives have to have purpose although the idea of purpose is often used in a religious context
1178919 i use it in a worldly sense having purpose can mean many kinds of goals some people focus on self improvement others focus on bettering the lives of others both are comendable goals but the latter is by far the most important doing things that make life better for others is undoubtedly the most important and satisfying of all purpose goals

1178956 i reserve the right to revise and extend my remarks
1178957 our enrollment is not where we want it to be i found out tonight there is a lot of recruitment for our athletes its disgusting
1178958 those are some of the battles we will have to fight
1178959 i hate the fact that people would take advantage of us is this situation
1178960 weve gotten more than in the past but not a flood or major influx
1178961 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
1178962 conservatives still think highly of him and are enthusiastic supporters whenever he speaks
1178963 for a campaign that has largely failed in reaching out to conservatives reaching out to cheney wouldnt be a bad idea
1178964 you have to put a depth chart out before the first exhibition game
1178965 i think we all know there are a number of positions that are very close but you have to put someone down at first team and second team even though you really dont know its that close
1178966 its the same thing i told you a week ago wednesday im not sure
1178967 when i know ill let you guys know if i made comments every time i heard i rumor id be talking to you every day id have to answer every question that you ask me lets deal with reality when we know something well let the media know
1178968 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1178969 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1178970 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1178971 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1178972 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1178973 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1178974 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1178975 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue
1178976 were preparing for a category 2 though we believe it wont be that severe
1178977 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1178978 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1178979 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1178980 were advising residents to take care of their possessions that are susceptible when the tide comes over the bulkheads
1178981 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1178982 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1178983 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1178984 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1178985 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1178986 were already embedded in the hospitality and travel sector locally and have some customers we have worked on with ideas
1178987 were very excited to add revenue management capabilities to the sas offering this is an opportunity for both sas and ideas to grow and further embed ourselves into this industry
1178988 weve been looking to grow our business within hospitality and also outside of that into other vertical markets and the acquisition by sas enables us to do that
1178989 ideas will continue to prioritise the hospitality industry its solutions combined with leading edge sas capabilities like forecasting optimisation and statistics will also extend to other industries outside of travel hospitality and retail

1178992 we dont want people hanging out in the first row intoxicated they put ourselves in danger and that puts our guys in danger
1178993 well thats great and all but we want to see the game in action
1178994 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1178995 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1178996 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1178997 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1178998 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1178999 i always keep in my mind everything comes full circle
1179000 the good thing about it is it did i dont feel anything different its just like i was going on a vacation for a little bit
1179001 i just remember how it all went down it was a shock
1179002 just a sour moment at that point and then the next thing you know i was on a plane headed to miami trying to adjust down there
1179003 it was tough at first but you just have to roll with it
1179004 it wasnt a good situation down there because all my four years down there it was like a coaching carousel
1179005 it was like coaches in and out from head coaches to offensive coordinators its hard to get adjusted or acclimated to anything like that when you dont have stability or anything
1179006 its pretty much the same old marty in our book
1179007 hes a little wiser now that hes been in the league nine years a smooth route runner and his hands are what separates him from others theyre huge
1179008 you shouldnt have a guy who goes out there and has to play 70 plays a game
1179009 that should be split keep guys fresh keep guys ready
1179010 right now were just out there practicing trying to get a feel for one another and get a little chemistry going in this offense so we can be pretty good this year
1179011 im quite sure once thursday rolls around and then as we get on later into preseason games and the regular season ill figure out what that role is
1179012 wenn niemand hereingelassen wird die produkte anzusehen ist das herausgeworfenes geld

1179016 it was very hard for us to really try and get it across to people that this is a massively different thing
1179017 its a very different kind of experience of reading comics and looking at comics then what youre used to and there really isnt a frame of a reference
1179018 leif had a pretty cool idea of what his story was going to be and he wanted me to write it for him
1179019 it sounded like he had it worked out pretty close and i was like i think you should write this as you have it worked out pretty good
1179020 it was written when both he and tori were in their early formative careers when they were still figuring out what they were going do and how to make that happen
1179021 it was very helpful to have a lot of the back story from rantz
1179022 the original story that we wanted to do was i dont like mondays canete said
1179023 i was a huge fan of that song and unfortunately it was a cover song that tori did from another artist and there was a lot of legal technicalities
1179024 we spoke with rantz just trying to find a song that was similar in tone and similar in meaning rantz suggested girl and that was a song that as i just kind of listened to over and over again a story formed in my head
1179025 one was pure fiction and one was autobiographical and very personal and actually that was the one they wanted me to do it was a real great opportunity to do a real personal piece that i dont know if i would have done otherwise
1179026 i dont read a whole lot of comics i dont spend a whole lot of looking at artwork in that sense
1179027 music plays a real big part of the creative process for me so when i was actually sitting down to start working on this i found it really natural in that i listen to music a lot when i am working music always plays a big part in my creative process so for doing a tori project it felt like a natural progression
1179028 i think the main thing is the same way we wanted to do something radically different with this we wouldnt want to repeat ourselves and just do another volume in the same format and the same kind of approach

1179030 i had never been to see an eisa performance before last summers 10 000 festival i knew something about it but had never experienced it close up and ill tell you that when the drummers hit their first beat and began their first song i literally felt my eyes well up with tears your body vibrates with the music it is amazing

1179044 has become a much more important processor in a system than it was just a few years ago when everything was 2 d in nature
1179045 intel is committed to larrabee in a way theyve never been committed to a gpu before
1179046 unless tomorrows answer is unambiguous and positive we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions
1179047 in the absence of a clear positive response from iran we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1179048 to no longer play for time but give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
1179049 very very positive there were a number of thousand people in front of the town stage in market square on sunday for john spillane and george murphy and that couldnt have happened without the great weather
1179050 the crowds really seem to have come out in force for the country music concert too
1179051 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1179052 if we got it up to 80 per cent that would mean about an additional 8 million a year for the exchequer
1179053 this new system allows us offer court users across the country choice and ease of access in relation to financial dealings with the courts
1179054 it will make it easier to pay fines and will speed up payments in the family law area the system allows immediate access to paying fees in the small claims procedure and also allow us automatically refund bail monies once a case is ended
1179055 as well as being an investment in our service to citizens it will also be about efficiencies in terms of time and cost
1179056 any suggestion of a general direction by ibec to employers to the effect that they should refuse to engage with us would contravene most collective agreements and therefore raise the prospect of industrial unrest long before it would otherwise be anticipated
1179057 by telling their members not to engage in local collective bargaining they are laying the foundations for serious industrial unrest in this country
1179058 could still be possible if the social partners can show leadership in charting a way forward
1179059 if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1179060 simply not feasible for low paid workers who desperately need an increase in income in preparation for increased energy and food costs this winter
1179061 the reality is that the negotiations have broken down and there are no arrangements to reconvene there has been no indication from the employers they will adopt a more reasonable stance if the talks were to resume accordingly we have no alternative other than to press ahead with our claims directly on those employers
1179062 there is an inability to pay clause in social partnership agreements which has worked very well until now
1179063 that would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid if such an agreement was supported by a government anti inflation strategy this would send out a very positive message about our economic management
1179064 seeks to establish the source of the illness and laboratory testing of foods is being carried out which should provide further information shortly
1179065 medical staff are increasingly managing complex often multiple serious and chronic medical conditions modern antibiotics are very effective in treating many of these however we have to balance prescribing with our understanding of the possible effects of long term antibiotic use and the links with acquired infections such as c difficile
1179066 i said at the outset that these games would be historic they are already a landmark the mere fact that they are coming to china home to nearly 20 of the worlds population is significant
1179067 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1179068 the olympic movement should constantly seek to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries by promoting sport and our olympic values the olympic rings are a powerful symbol recognised worldwide because they represent a set of universal values
1179069 it is our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share in the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future
1179070 in 1993 they had bid for the 2000 games that were won by sydney and at that time the theory was that they were not ready
1179071 they stayed away from the athens round of bidding to address the issues and by the time the 2001 bidding came round the feeling was that they deserved the chance ultimately the members were asked to decide how they could say no to a country that is home to a fifth of the worlds population
1179072 the challenge for china has been the degree of interest in other areas of society that the games has brought china has had to deal with political inquiries from the very start the ioc will claim that this has been a good and helpful process and that the olympics have hastened the process of change in china
1179073 this is what the minister has to show after three full years and a 40 billion spend three inpatient beds a year
1179074 the governments commitment to increase total acute bed capacity was virtually complete
1179075 in fact by that time the total number of inpatient beds had fallen by 42 beds during the first full year of the ministers tenure between 2005 and 2007 the net gain in inpatient beds amounted to just 10 this occurred over a period when health spending increased from 11 9 billion in 2005 to 15 billion in 2007
1179076 this would be risible if it wasnt for the thousands of patients tragically affected by the ministers ineptitude in health
1179077 the 21 000 patients still on waiting lists for more than three months need look no further than the minister who delivers nothing beyond soundbites
1179078 40 billion and three years on the ministers record in health is little more than a sick joke
1179079 were in a better state going into next week than we would have been if we had won the munster final
1179080 kieran donaghy and tommy is still a work in progress when we went with direct early ball we had the monaghan defence in quite a bit of trouble

1179082 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1179083 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1179084 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1179085 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1179086 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the some straight talk
1179087 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1179088 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1179089 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1179090 in the morning sow thine seed and in the evening withhold not your hand for thou knowest not what it will prosper
1179091 the petitions in boxes behind me ask a very simple question for coloradans to answer in november should we make investments in the future of colorado or should we continue to pay an unnecessary 300 million subsidy to an industry that doesnt need it
1179092 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1179093 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the straight talk
1179094 but if he continues to reject any compromise that takes away tax breaks for the same oil companies that have given millions to his campaign wed rather not waste the s tax dollars
1179095 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1179096 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1179097 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1179109 well i think her understanding of scripture about women preachers was really great but now shes just gone too far she must be a womens libber
1179110 let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air over the livestock over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground

1179114 but for adam there was not found an help meet for him
1179115 the hebrew expression ezer kenegdo appears meaning one who is the same as the other and who surrounds protects aids helps supports there is no indication of inferiority or of a secondary position in a hierarchical separation of the male and female spheres roles of responsibility authority or social position
1179116 ah at last this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh instead of presenting a subordinate superior hierarchical relationship for the man and the woman this passage presents a relationship of mutuality
1179117 clearly the womans role is to help meet her husbands desires
1179118 god is a god of order a christian home should be a peaceful and well ordered home so of course there must be someone in leadership someone must be in authority and this verse makes it clear that god always gives that authority to the man its not a matter of worth just a matter of god ordained roles
1179119 this circle of worldliness caused by the fall can be broken by christs provision salvation restores our fellowship with god the holy spirit not only gives us back the lost access to god but also enables us to know how to reunite ourselves with each other again as equal and it is this banner of freedom in christ and the equality of believers that carries us on toward reversing the principles of worldliness which teach us to exploit and manipulate we can go on to relationships of non exploitation and non manipulation in which each person is of equal value with equal opportunity to experience and express his or her full personhood in the past we have taken this prediction of sins result and have tried to institutionalize it and enforce it as gods will for us instead we should be working to reverse it as we have the other results of the fall and reinstate that lost relationship of mutual responsibility and respect that was present before the fall god provided a savior to mend the broken relationship between his human creation and himself now he wants to work through us his creation to reverse the bad effects of the fall it is time we worked with him to reinstate the original relationship between man and woman in marriage

1179137 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
1179138 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
1179139 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1179140 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1179141 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure
1179142 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1179143 refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1179144 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1179145 i wish i wasnt so pretty so all these boys wouldnt like me
1179146 no you cant you have chores to do in the morning before you go to work no you can only do one not both no whatever call your dad and see what he says

1179148 we believe that we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident and capable of hosting a peaceful and safe games
1179149 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1179150 to view regarding uighur terrorist acts with caution as government authorities consistently fail to provide evidence to back up their claims
1179151 whats important is that alexander solzhenitsyn spent time in prison like millions of others
1179152 with respect to kiwibank i shouldnt have made the comments i made national has had no discussions about kiwibank and has no plans to sell it
1179153 comments i made regarding the complexity of wff have been construed as criticism of john key that is wrong my repeated responses to this question yesterday reflected my determination not to widen the debate not an attempt to criticise john key
1179154 i should have made it clear that i meant no such criticism and im making that clear today
1179155 i was advocating as the finance spokesman a much more radical overhaul of working for families
1179156 for the last two years bill and i have working very closely on that issue and what weve come to recognise is that it is a lot more difficult to change and i think he had a valid point
1179157 they may wrap the thing up in blankets but it doesnt put it to bed
1179158 i think mr english sees himself as the one the who drives the policy and he sees mr key as just the front man the one who goes around the country smiling nicely and saying nice things that people want to hear
1179159 i think this formulae which they repeat like a mantra that there would be no sales in the first term is simply a code for of course we have discussed these things we think it is very hard to get elected when you say you will sell state owned assets
1179160 little girl a really cute girl began pulling on my trousers asking where are my parents

1179165 unanimous that super rugby has reached the end of its life
1179166 we had a few guys who had class conflicts and these are important classes for them moving toward graduation
1179167 with the squad basically split in half so everybody gets more repetitions there are spots where missing even one guy can keep us from getting a lot done as a group were really pleased with our conditioning and that gives us the flexibility to go in the afternoon and get our work done
1179168 the first group moved fast and covered a lot of ground they knew what to do and how to do it at a fast tempo
1179169 to some degree a lot of the new players arent sure what direction to go yet so the second group didnt keep up in what they got done but the effort was there once some of them figured out the tempo
1179170 wir werden nicht mehr gro experimentieren es hat sich so langsam herauskristallisiert wer spielt

1179176 it is like a new house for the students now that we have a new looking school it will allow the students to work harder and better

1179183 right from the outset we knew the 12 month course was going to be the best for me given the growth and size of the tumour
1179184 when youre young and youve got young kids you want to hold on to every chance youve got to be there for them every percentage theyre going to give you to improve your survival rate is just precious
1179185 when we decided the 12 months of herceptin was the best chance of watching my kids grow up all of my friends and family have got together and have been fundraising for the money thats just been massive
1179186 people say were in a recession and its a really hard time to be fundraising for things like that its been fantastic
1179187 a portion of these gains is likely to persist into the future
1179188 after recovery from the drought growth in milksolids production of 3 percent per year is expected

1179193 heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of exxon mobil and other oil companies on policy makers in washington dc
1179194 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
1179195 1 the msm is not going to get this news out
1179196 i think its good we get our news from multiple sources and that includes the huff
1179197 at least thats how joel haugen challenging oregon rep david wu decided to thank his partys leadership for their support

1179199 heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of exxon mobil and other oil companies on policy makers in washington dc
1179200 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
1179201 obama has taken 213 884 from the oil and gas industry as of feb 29th according to the center for responsive politics sen hillary clinton has taken 306 813 in that same period two of obamas campaign bundlers are also ceos for oil and gas companies per a list released on his campaign web site robert cavnar listed as a bundler who has raised between 50 000 to 100 000 for the campaign is the chairman and ceo of mission resources corp a houston based firm george kaiser also listed in the same 50 000 to 100 000 category is the ceo of tulsa based kaiser francis oil company

1179203 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
1179204 quote for me the bills that have passed and who the writers were alongside the signers of the bill alongside the writing into law by bush where are they i would love to read about how bush signed a law enforcing cap and trade or windfall profits or where are the 100s of thousands of green jobs created of 10 years with 150 billion invested to get up and running
1179205 it is not about posing ideas its about getting them implemented and none even the worthless g8 have had enough impact or seriousness to really help out on energy
1179206 create new forum of largest greenhouse gas emitters obama will create a global energy forum that includes all g 8 members plus brazil china india mexico and south africa
1179207 obama is the only one talking about it that can actually make these changes he is the only presidential candidate that is talking about this while mccain cant even talk
1179208 whereas 100 of your comments are either attacking obama or obama supporters
1179209 his stances are starting to take on a bush like appearance
1179210 are you claiming that obama is not receiving contributions from oil companies
1179211 the one thing i have to remind folks though of weve been talking about this through republican administrations and democratic administrations for decades and the reason it doesnt change you can take a look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with environmental groups one he met with renewable energy folks once and then he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy weve got to put the national interest ahead of the special interest and thats what ill do when im president of the united states
1179212 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1179213 so if i was a oil exec wat would i do raise prices enough to cover the tax on my profits
1179214 and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal mccains really promoting is more offshore drilling
1179215 i will be for change and ill bring you change

1179276 nba beat writer ian thomsen wrote on friday that the latest rumor he was hearing was that olympiakos would make a bid for lebron james when he has the chance to opt out of his contract in 2010
1179277 at first glance it is ludicrous to imagine that the nbas next big star would move overseas as hes trying to win championships and replace michael jordan as a household name globally
1179278 from james point of view playing overseas for a year could enhance his marketing status and turn him into more of a global star than he is now he could build up his name in an entirely unprecedented way and then return home as a free agent to sign with the nba team of his choosing
1179279 magazine last week is going to become more of a global star by playing for a greek team than he would in the nba ian lebron james is one of the most

1179281 4 000 u s deaths and a handful of images
1179282 even memorial services for killed soldiers once routinely open are increasingly off limits detainees were widely photographed in the early years of the war but the department of defense citing prisoners rights has recently stopped that practice as well

1179286 the photographer was immediately kicked out of his or her embed following publication of such photos
1179287 stop photographing delete his memory cards and surrender his cameras
1179288 high ranking marine public affairs officers demanded that mr miller remove the photos when he refused his embed was terminated
1179289 would not allow even the pants or shoes of an injured or killed marine to be depicted in images
1179290 specifically mr miller provided our enemy with an after action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of u s and iraqi forces
1179291 mr millers complete lack of respect to these marines their friends and families is shameful how do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened
1179292 the fact that the images i took of the suicide bombing which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people says that whatever they are doing to limit this type of photo getting out it is working
1179293 i took pictures of something they didnt like and they removed me deciding what i can and cannot document i dont see a clearer definition of censorship
1179294 they embedded a war photographer and when i took a photo of war they disembedded me its as if its okay to take pictures of them handing lollipops to kids on the street and providing medical care but photographing the actual war is unacceptable

1179457 anyone who is paying attention would have seen the mess that americas big three auto makers are in consider this little fun fact as of this last friday the market capitalization of general motors gm was just over 5 billion thats all toyota has about 25 times that so are several other healthy auto makers and they all know that times are tough yet gm expects sales to pick up later this year but consider that 5 billion its cheap yet no one is touching gm no one wants to buy it even to take it apart and shut it down why every single asset gm has is pledged multiple times as collateral for loans that it cannot repay while it is losing 41 billion per year

1179461 this year both media and online leaders are grappling with the internets increasing fragmentation
1179462 at the same time the barons of old line newspapers and broadcast tv seem to have realized its pointless to keep fighting the shift online but theyre still unsure how to embrace it and theyre struggling to attract new online users just to survive the flagging economy slowing consumer spending and costlier capital on wall street will only add to any gloom and may prevent the summit from living up to its reputation as an incubator for big deals
1179463 i saw something big happening in the past 18 months on the campaign trail i was encouraged that we are capable of waking up and doing the right thing i have literally met thousands of high school and college kids who are quite willing to accept the challenge and responsibility of a free society and reject the cradle to grave welfare that is promised them by so many do good politicians
1179464 the real problem is the government cant provide the safety and economic security that it claims
1179465 the culmination of 40 years of gradual but consistent distortion of economic statistics have come home to roost and explain much of our current morass
1179466 the long campaign of statistical massage began in the kennedy administration
1179467 president lyndon johnson a clever political dealmaker came up with the concept for the unified budget for the 1969 fiscal year as he was about to finish his final year in office
1179468 not to be outdone by prior administrations president nixon requested that fed chairman arthur burns develop the concept of core inflation statistics this was invented by others not nixon and presented to nixon as a
1179469 the reagan administration added a critical element to the inflation manipulation game when they convinced the bureau of labor statistics bls in 1983 that housing inflation was overstating the cpi
1179470 the changes proposed by the boskin commission were not implemented until 1996 under president clinton and with the support of fed chairman alan greenspan

1179474 this is my first time in the driveway i havent seen it when i get out of here im going to look for the range
1179475 shortly after that hopefully ill get to the first tee and play some holes
1179476 im a long ways away from here but its not because i havent had invitations steve brady is another great michigan player who works here and has asked me to come down and its just never seemed to work out but i hear wonderful things about it a lot of my members grew up here and said youre going to love the golf course and i have seen it on tv
1179477 i know a little bit more what to expect that will probably be the big thing
1179478 for a club pro to come into a major championship i played a few buick opens but its just the buzz the way the course is set up im going to draw off the experience of having played in it and try to forget the scores i shot
1179479 its nice to see or be close enough where i can get a lot of my friends here to support me
1179480 its nice i just hopped in my car this morning slept in my bed last night and drove down and didnt have to get on an airplane so thats good
1179481 but the big thing will be that im here in michigan it is my kind of grass that i grew up on thats what gives me a little bit of good feelings
1179482 i think i may have forgotten my deodorant do you think you could smell me and let me know if everything is okay
1179483 standing next to you i just feel all sweaty and frumpy it kind of sucks

1179530 with my art and my books i dont need to go outside
1179531 we sit on our back porch and fantasize that we own all this land
1179532 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage

1179538 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended
1179539 we have lost our way we have a government of men not a government of law were talking about the restoration of constitutional government and the rule of law
1179540 in each town we pass through with every american we meet at every farmhouse and every crossroads we will educate the people about the condition of the country and the solution to its troubles the principles of liberty and the constitution
1179541 we will cut a swath across two states and leave a trail of freedom in our path
1179542 the case for freedom the constitution is the way forward for america
1179543 we will also encourage dialogue about the constitutional issues raised by the presentation we intend to spark thought and discussion giving voice to the people on the most pressing matters facing the nation today
1179544 the response from the people of wisconsin has been tremendous we have town hall meetings scheduled at high schools public libraries american legion posts and churches the responsive participation we are receiving is exemplified by the leader of a boy scouts troop who upon learning of the upcoming meeting offered to distribute flyers to all the parents and scouts at their next gathering he also volunteered to place the flyer on public bulletin boards around town and place an ad in the town newspaper
1179545 i cant believe what this country is becoming its sure not what i went to fight for
1179546 i always say if you dont have rules then youre going have rulers
1179547 someone is going to decide if its not the unbiased law then its going to be men with a self interested agenda

1179549 if something happens to butch james then i cant bring in a guy who has not been playing
1179550 the players all need to keep sharp and its best if i allow the guys to play not standing around holding kit bags
1179551 its not only about the fly halves we also have to get the composition of the whole team right
1179552 percy montgomery will never start a game at fly half while i am coach but if theres an emergency during the game then we can call on him and he will do a good job there
1179553 with any selection the landscape can change if i decide i want a second fly half on the bench then i can call ruan pienaar back immediately
1179554 we announced a 30 man squad for the tri nations home leg and the other four players are still on hand and can come back anytime
1179555 because we have good relations with the provinces we can ask them to play these guys in certain positions
1179556 ruan pienaar has not played a lot at fly half and i had a long chat with john plumtree pienaar and steyns coach at the natal sharks and he knows why the players are there
1179557 it was a massive privilege just to be there to shake his hand if i live to that age i hope i look as good as he does
1179558 nobody has anything against that old man he is a legend in his own lifetime and few people can say that
1179559 weve just got to try to keep winning but im impressed with the improvement that we are getting out of our players
1179560 i am a bit cautious i think you can get too excited
1179561 there is absolutely no prize whatsoever for being in the eight after 21 rounds i still think we have got more in us as a team
1179562 i think we have to play a lot better if we want to keep our season alive
1179563 that was a tough decision but a clear decision to save energy for the 100m
1179564 we are in a state of good relations with the clubs and im a little bit surprised that the clubs are taking such a strong stance not only against fifa but also against the players
1179565 i think the players deserve a little bit of respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
1179566 i tried to train once in two weeks and when i couldnt really walk i knew what was coming
1179567 it was just a matter of confirming it with the medical staff
1179568 his resilience to come back from adversity be it injury or any other thing off the field that hes had to deal with has been outstanding
1179569 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1179570 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1179571 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1179572 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1179573 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1179574 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1179575 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1179576 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1179577 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1179578 you see the condition that he is in currently he is certainly well and truly preparing himself
1179579 he is an absolute professional and was always classified as one of the best trainers at west coast
1179580 i think that it is the kind of work like mentality that he has that will set him up well and truly for next year
1179581 the football club is built on trust and thats something that has been compromised yesterday and something thats taken very seriously as well
1179582 towards the end of the season final eight team playing st kilda friday night earlier in the year collingwood are genuine grand finals contender
1179583 i would have thought all the players would be there just focused on trying to make the four
1179584 i dont think the club has a cultural difference to any others
1179585 i think these are issues that every club deals with and i suppose the method of how theyre dealt with is different
1179586 at collingwood everything seems to become bigger than it is anywhere else and theres a good reason for that its because theres a lot of people that love the club and a lot of people that hate it
1179587 i mean in most employment contracts there is a clause that says an employee can be dismissed for serious or wilful misconduct
1179588 i turned a small rock and found it hiding underneath
1179589 i have no expectation of ever finding another smallest anything
1179590 now hold still so i can run and grab the camera

1179620 to my knowledge no other approved or investigational treatment has stabilized function across all facets of alzheimers disease for this length of time
1179621 these data suggest that dimebon may provide long term benefits to alzheimers patients and provide further support for its potential as a promising therapeutic to treat this devastating disease
1179622 a nearly 10 point improvement over placebo in moderate patients on the adas cog a well validated cognition scale in alzheimers disease is unquestionably of clinical significance especially in light of a clinical effect seen on the clinicians assessment of global function
1179623 if the results we saw for both the mild and moderate patients can be replicated i believe that dimebon will be an important advance in the treatment of alzheimers disease regardless of stage
1179624 all of the approved alzheimers disease drugs operate by one of two mechanisms cholinesterase inhibition or nmda receptor antagonism
1179625 the body of preclinical and clinical data generated thus far convinces me that dimebon is exerting its effects through a different mechanism the data presented today support the hypothesis that dimebon improves mitochondrial dysfunction this is a novel mechanism that may in part explain the clinical benefits seen in alzheimers patients treated with dimebon
1179626 the results highlight a significant hole in our healthcare system
1179627 they re confirm our fears that this issue is being swept under the carpet and not being talked about with professionals an open dialogue is essential to proper diagnosis and treatment
1179628 not all memory complaints mark alzheimers disease but if they do the earlier an individual knows the earlier he or she can be treated plan for the future and embrace social services support this is a window of opportunity to delay cognitive decline and thereby improve quality of life for individuals with the disease and their families
1179629 americans need to step up their efforts to optimize overall health including brain health the threat of alzheimers disease and co existing conditions is too great to ignore
1179630 the increase in real consumer spending was quite minimal despite the massive fiscal stimulus
1179631 i think the ultimate solution is a nationalization of both fannie and freddie
1179632 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
1179633 we know the hispanic community is in need of increased education on the benefits of diagnosing and treating ad early
1179634 this news should serve as a call to action for hispanic families to watch for early signs of ad among their loved ones and speak with a doctor as soon as possible if symptoms are suspected
1179635 all too often hispanics dismiss the symptoms of ad as signs of normal aging and wait years before consulting a doctor
1179636 this study reminds us of the value of treating ad to slow symptoms of the disease and i encourage primary care physicians with hispanic patients to start screening for signs of dementia at a younger age potentially at 55 or 60 years
1179637 the laboratory investigation suggests that administration of a perfluorocarbon with the characteristics and performance of oxycyte combined with 100 oxygen therapy can reverse tissue oxygen deficit and holds promise for reducing ischemic injury
1179638 traumatic spine injury is a major cause of long term disability for our troops in the war zones as well as 200 000 plus civilian injuries per year if we could develop a rapid technique to salvage as much function as possible immediately after injury this would be a major breakthrough in spine trauma the key to tissue salvage may well be immediate oxygen delivery to tissues at risk
1179639 weve always known what our compound is capable of now this latest research shows the possibility of yet another indication for treatment with oxycyte in addition to those weve previously discussed potentially broadening our product portfolio if this early research translates to humans oxycyte could have a significant impact on the lives of spinal cord injury victims
1179640 the fda is working with us and reviewing all our data
1179641 theyre asking questions and were providing answers the agency is doing their work very diligently and we will continue to invest the time it takes to bring this process to the outcome we all want it is in everybodys interest to establish a fully reviewed trial protocol that can lead our product to market
1179642 while there is no cure or existing treatment to prevent alzheimers disease there are currently available fda approved treatments such as combination therapy with memantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor which can alleviate symptoms by providing cognitive functional and behavioral benefits
1179643 these findings reinforce the safety tolerability and efficacy of memantine in a newly developed once a day formulation
1179644 with this novel formulation the efficacy and tolerability of namenda is delivered in a more convenient once daily dose
1179645 youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one
1179646 have you read the specs on this order an emt paramedic has to be able to carry an injured person up a wet grassy hill in the dark dodge stray bullets to reach a dying child unarmed enter homes a health inspector wouldnt touch and not wrinkle their uniform
1179647 he has to be able to lift three times his own weight crawl into wrecked cars with barely enough room to move and console a grieving mother as he is doing cpr on a baby he knows will never breathe again
1179648 he has to be in top mental conditionat all times running on no sleep black coffee and half eaten meals and he has to have six pairs of hands
1179649 its the three pairs of eyes an emt medic has to have
1179650 one pair that sees open sores as hes drawing blood and asks the patient if they may be hiv positive
1179651 another pair here on the side of his head for is partners safety another pair of eyes here in front that can look reassuringly at a bleeding victim and say youll be all right maam when he knows it isnt so
1179652 i already have a model that can talk a 250 pound drunk out from behind a steering wheel without incident and feed a family of five on a private service paycheck
1179653 it can tell you the symptoms of 100 illnesses recite drug calculations in its sleep intubate defibrillate medicate and continue cpr nonstop over terrain that any doctor would fear and still it keeps its sense of humor
1179654 this emt medic also has phenominal control he can deal with a multi victim trauma coaz a frightened elderly person to unlock their door comfort a murder victims family and then read in the daily paper how emts and paramedics were unable to locate a house quickly enough allowing a person to die a house which had no street sign no house numbers no phone to call back
1179655 i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model
1179656 its for bottled up emotions for patients they tried in vain to save for committment to hope that they will make a difference in a persons chance to survive for life
1179657 if its fuck me nigga then you know its fuck you
1179658 yo you can come and have a conversation with us too you know
1179659 this kind of idea that president sarkozy can come to ireland and persuade us to change our mind or try and hear what we have to say and give us all three minutes each i think there is a little degree of arrogance in that
1179660 it is clear to me that the format proposed is not one that can elicit the diverse views of the irish public on this complex matter
1179661 utilizing a horrible american accent i can mentally process what a great trip we had to italy truly it was a great 10 days we ended up spending 3 days in rome about 6 days in the
1179662 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
1179663 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
1179664 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
1179665 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
1179666 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
1179667 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
1179668 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
1179669 i wanted to make certain that if i did something wrong let other members know what line there is to cross
1179670 and in the other area i needed them to help me to remove any question of gifts where no gifts exist
1179671 many concerns that the intelligence community voiced that made it difficult to prosecute leaks
1179672 the showing that the danger exceeds the value of disclosure is a complete imponderable
1179673 that would require the government to come in and basically make a bad problem worse by articulating precisely how threatened disclosure could cause yet more harm
1179674 what im not willing to do is to take steps that will essentially do more to protect leakers than it does to protect journalists
1179675 it was a cash flow and capital situation there was a lack of cash
1179676 we have started an orderly shut down in preparation for the storm
1179677 the swell wont likely be big enough to do sustained damage

1179680 it started out with a physical profile and gossett is a dead on match

1179682 there is no evidence to put mr gossett in the pacific northwest in november 1971
1179683 no aspect of the story by cook can be verified
1179684 i believe cooper paid for the jump with his life
1179685 he was a parachutist and had experience in low level jumping
1179686 every time he told me about d b cooper his story never changed
1179687 in the morning he told me he had some business to do and about three hours later he came back and said ive got everything done its time to go back home
1179688 were working on the theory that gossett had a safety deposit box in vancouver
1179689 i want to kill her but what can i do
1179690 when she first had katelynn for the first two or three years she was a great parent
1179691 shes been cheerful in a good mood i assumed that maybe she was going to get custody of her child back
1179692 what im hearing is that the family court awarded donna irving custody of this little girl but we wont be able to confirm that until tuesday
1179693 i saw her in the dollar store on saturday everything was good

1179734 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs
1179735 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
