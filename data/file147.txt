1470000 i think the consensus is the fed will probably be at 2 percent for some time now
1470001 i think if anything the tilt of the fed announcement was a little bit more toward the weakness in the economy than most had expected that may have been the only surprise
1470002 that probably might have been part of the reassurance for the bond market
1470003 probably the best hope that everybody has is that oil and commodity prices will come down fast enough to take the pressure off inflation
1470004 i think treasurys have been fairly resilient considering how well the stock market has done today but what were seeing is pressure in the 10 and 30 year sector where the supply is going to be in the next two days
1470005 wall street likely felt a sigh of relief at a no surprise statement that wasnt overly hawkish and
1470006 the statement expressed confidence that maintaining a low federal funds rate and the feds special lending facilities would resolve the credit crisis and lift the economy but how the banks are run is the problem
1470007 until the fed takes up genuine reform on wall street its policies remain inadequate to address the credit crisis and malaise gripping the economy
1470008 its about time i get whats owed to me from the situation i was stuck in
1470009 its unfortunate things have turned out the way they did but artists deserve to be compensated fairly by their labels for the work they do and that wasnt happenin in my case im happy to finally be a free man and make a new start
1470010 just imagine steve jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand asking random people do you work on mobileme
1470011 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1470012 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1470013 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1470014 its a continuation of the reversal out of the commodities stocks into financials which has been the big trade of late
1470015 weve broken down now below last weeks low so the risk remains to the downside
1470016 we are thrilled that darko will be helming the women a work that he is so passionate about and that features such an incredible cast of broadways leading ladies

1470019 we dont believe the security or privacy of these would be members will be compromised in any way
1470020 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1470021 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1470022 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1470023 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1470024 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1470025 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1470026 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see
1470027 they did have a near miss with an ied in their vehicle a couple of weeks ago
1470028 he said mom my truck got blown up by an ied very matter of fact he knew he was in very grave danger
1470029 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
1470030 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
1470031 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
1470032 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time

1470035 and he knew i would be lost without him so he sent me some more he sent me five more mini boogers
1470036 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1470037 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1470038 in essence it was a truncation error in the final printout
1470039 the problem was identified and it was fixed the error did not change the outcome

1470049 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1470050 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1470051 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1470052 so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them
1470053 fix yourself love yourself find peace and then hopefully everything will come easily afterwards

1470091 many times we have been fooled by peoples actions unaware of what they are really thinking but not so the lord
1470092 again in luke 18 9 we see the omniscient christ exposing the pride and self righteousness of the pharisees
1470093 these like others had no desire to know the truth but were gods unto themselves seeking to be justified by their own righteousness
1470094 now that we know gods will we realize it becomes his responsibility to keep alive and get the truth to anyone who has a desire to know the true and living god of creation

1470103 yet god waited 400 years and not one except rahab had a desire to know the true and living god

1470235 we hope that this case will send a clear message to hawaiis animal fighting community that the times have changed and the community will no longer stand for these illegal and heinous activities
1470236 how can people buy that dreck its selling like hotcakes what is wrong with this country
1470237 if we are going to win this thing we are going to have to fight back people should be outraged brother if we are not outraged we could lose
1470238 its a very nice home but it reeked with a smell and when you went back into a couple of the rooms it knocked you out
1470239 no animal should be forced to live like that and its not healthy for this person to go back in there its pretty nasty
1470240 hughes said she has been a breeder for 15 years and has had no problems
1470241 we deal with hoarders a lot but this is the first time ive dealt with the huge number of animals from a puppy mill situation
1470242 there are few circumstances when the government or anyone has the right to come into our homes and take things
1470243 its not about whether one disagrees or agrees with the function of suncoast or any other nonprofit organization
1470244 the issue is we all have laws that we are required to follow and the way everyone is protected is everyone playing by the same set of rules
1470245 hes been a humane officer since 1989 and the statute does not provide that its ever revoked or expired
1470246 on april 7 when we walked in the house we made a commitment to the animals and that commitment grows stronger and stronger each day and we are going to fight for each and every one of them
1470247 must have the approval of the mayor of the city in which the society or association exists
1470248 we have given that to the lawyer who represents animal services and she is reviewing it
1470249 the judge has already ruled and its pretty clear what the statute requires you to do and it applies to every organization
1470250 he cant file a petition saying i want to keep these animals because he didnt have authority to take them in first place
1470251 ive been doing this for 20 something years and its never been a issue
1470252 you wouldnt keep a human being in those conditions you shouldnt keep an animal in those types of conditions
1470253 we pulled up to a beautiful home with a perfectly manicured yard and i thought this must be the wrong place
1470254 when you opened the door into the room where the adult dogs were kept there was the most horrible smell you could ever imagine this was no different than the backwoods puppy mills you saw on oprah and other shows
1470255 she said the usual i love them i love them but when we told her we were going to take the dogs then she started negotiating to keep the young ones
1470256 all of a sudden she didnt love the old ones so much anymore its all about the money she could make
1470257 weve seen congestive heart failure some are in oxygen cages one has a broken leg which has been set pneumonia and other respiratory problems
1470258 hey dude you dont really know me and you will probably think this is very strange but basically i have been wanting to have gay sex with a dead body for an awful long time and your very attractive and was just wondering if after you die i would be able to have sex with your corpse and i will pay your family 25k for your services
1470259 he probably wouldnt have made it much longer not with his jugular exposed like that
1470260 you know maybe we need to drive be the pound every once in a while slowly just to remind her
1470261 so mr leland how did you get a job as a special agent for the f b i
1470262 i was born in boston and educated at harvard i knew i had the capability to work a strenuous job and wanted to spend my life helping the citizens of our country i took s w a t training and the f b i was glad to accept me
1470263 what are some of the benefits of working this job
1470264 knowing that i am a part of protecting american citizens from all and any dangers is satisfactory the feeling of accomplishment that surrounds me after weve put the bad guys behind bars is a very rewarding feeling
1470265 there is some danger involved but i have learned to consider it more as an excercise for my keen senses

1470271 postpartum mothers experience a troubling burden of physical and emotional health challenges after giving birth although many of these problems abate over time far too many women were still experiencing them from 6 to 18 months after birth with more than 4 3 million births each year in the united states it is an urgent priority to better understand the reason for these challenges their implications for women and their families ways to prevent distress and morbidity and ways to help women and families before they experience detrimental effects
1470272 the overall picture is of recent mothers engaged in a juggling act carrying multiple and sometimes conflicting responsibilities while experiencing high levels of social physical and emotional health challenges there are concerns about whether large segments of this population have access to adequate health and social services and social support we are letting our mothers and babies down at one of the most critical and vulnerable times in their lives these survey results are a clarion call to action for programs policies clinical services and research to better understand and improve the experiences of new mothers and their families

1470282 it will be lost revenue to the counties that you can bet will be made up somewhere by an increase in property taxes
1470283 if the state is going to tighten its budget maybe the local governments will have to do the same thing
1470284 every branch of government ought to be looking at ways they can cut back
1470285 for a republican caucus that fancies itself as being tax cutters this is a hard decision to make but there are no good choices when youre 1 6 billion down
1470286 to come back now and say we dont have the money is awkward to say the least at this point we dont have a strategy
1470287 they just dont have the money to make up this shortfall
1470288 local governments are really having a hard time when youre talking about cutting budgets youre talking about cutting services
1470289 gap between desired and actual research skills among new associates
1470290 survey conducted by thomson west of 224 individuals including law firm librarians development directors attorney supervisors and newer attorneys at organizations ranging from solo practitioners to large law firms
1470291 best practices is divided into chapters or groups of chapters that address goal setting organization of a program of instruction delivering that instruction assessing the earning of the students during the instruction and evaluating the success of the instruction after its completion legal research is mentioned quite often as a tool to be used in the doctrinal courses as well as a skills course in its own right
1470292 both best practices and the carnegie report recommend a more practicum oriented approach to legal education the introduction of practical matters in the heretofore rigidly doctrinal courses such as torts property and contracts there should be a component about how to find the law pertaining to these doctrinal courses and such should be included in most of the doctrinal courses
1470293 the capitalistic era has served to loosen the sacred bond holding together that most intimate moral community the family which is the original cell unit of human society moreover communistic socialism as advocated by certain of its exponents wants to dissolve that bond completely the social system of human work on the other hand requires the restoration of the family it calls for the solidarity and unity of the family so that parents can be to their children and children can be to their parents what the natural order of things calls for the reform of the family is not primarily the responsibility of the economic system but the way in which an economy is organized must not at any time stand in its way or contribute to the destruction of the family in the very nation where became the big thing the engineer and economist leplay urged the state to intervene and regulate child and female labor he called for a new social policy which would everywhere restore the woman the mother and the children to the bosom of the family and he urged an and also shorter hours of work so that the father would again become a part of the family he urged that a family wage be paid to the father which would enable him to act as and remain its sole support it is of course easier for the father to take his rightful place in the family where he has that measure of economic independence which was the priceless advantage enjoyed by the middle class in earlier times and the upper classes before the age of the factory worker dawned the maintenance and strengthening of the middle class is therefore not a mere economic issue it goes beyond that and is a problem of great moral and social significance
1470294 wages represent that crucial portion of the national income on which the great majority of people are dependent for their livelihood the wage therefore has to be sufficient so that even the unskilled worker will have enough to live on at a decent human standard which corresponds to the level of cultural advancement achieved by the particular society in question it has to provide that not only for him alone but it must also enable him to support his family as befits his station in life and it must do this also when possible along with some sharing in the profits

1470315 no i dont but you should see the guy who so there are huge purchasing advantages and then there are the slick systems of forcing everyone to do what works so a chain store can be a fantastic enterprise

1470317 theyve invented a new loom that we think will do twice as much work as our old o nes
1470318 gee i hope this doesnt work because if it does im going to close the mill
1470319 its a lousy business were earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers b ut were not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business

1470333 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1470334 in essence it was a truncation error in the final printout

1470350 no secret deal or accommodation with the militias kept us out of the city nor were they waiting on the permission of des browne the defence secretary
1470351 when prime minister maliki launched operation charge of the knights in basra on 24 march british forces provided the assistance that the iraqi authorities sought from us including armour artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1470352 the only limit placed on the profile of our support was mr malikis rightful concern that the iraqi security forces be seen by the people of basrah to be those enforcing the rule of law in the city
1470353 it is true that as general petraeus described very clearly last september and again this april the coalition forces have been very actively supporting the iraqi governments efforts to seek reconciliation with insurgent elements british forces have played a significant role in this regard
1470354 in basrah we have always been prepared to talk to anyone who wishes to renounce violence and participate in the democratic process in iraq including the militias
1470355 in no sense did this act as an inhibition on supporting the legitimate iraqi security forces in their exercise of the rule of law in the city

1470390 if youre a big company like sony which has devices like the playstation integrating that content with your available devices whether its game consoles or the new internet connected tvs theyve been selling can be very compelling
1470391 itll be interesting to see how the relationships between the music labels under sonys control and apple and other music device makers play out
1470392 labels are in the business of selling licenses and intellectual property to anyone creating revenue generating distribution opportunities itll be interesting to see how these manufacturers react

1470437 this is jeff haas your host for this hour of music exploring the art form of jazz and its connection to classic rock r amp b blues folk and more
1470438 my dads philosophy was lets make this music accessible to anyone and everyone
1470439 my goal and its a lofty one is to sort of extend that vibe of accessibility engaging people on an emotional level with great music
1470440 most people dont commonly associate jazz with other types of music but in reality all popular music in this country comes from jazz
1470441 at first i was wondering if i might be boxing myself in maybe i would run out of connections in a year or so
1470442 but the possibilities are really endless someone was influenced by someone else or covered one of their tunes or shared the same mentors so many different avenues to explore
1470443 the music engages people opens hearts and minds on a level that you couldnt effectively do through words
1470444 im sure there will be some hard core classical music listeners who wont be interested in jeffs show but most of our audience came of age listening to the beatles and elvis and abba and mancini in the 60s and 70s my guess is theyll have a more inclusive attitude than their parents did about what makes great music
1470445 i bring my own musical biases to the table and the opportunity to produce this show has helped me address them
1470446 its really about the challenge of keeping an open mind
1470447 i find it kind of bizarre given what we were doing
1470448 when i look back i cant recall anything that would have been a threat to anyone to think that we were being watched its a surprise
1470449 i dont think they had a reason to be following what we were doing unless they were on to something else i dont know about
1470450 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1470451 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1470452 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about
1470453 all of those songs would have been sung at rallies demonstrations or meetings that we attended
1470454 says dr sandeep amin rush study investigator and anesthesiologist who surgically implants the device in the two visit operation
1470455 they are trying to get the value they think is reasonably in its various parts
1470456 it will be next to impossible to assess the franchise values unless you know what the contracts are that they work under
1470457 theres a very special media market in new york for sports teams
1470458 there is significant value over and above the average franchise because of the market
1470459 we believe that cablevisions options will be limited by the credit markets

1470464 gosh honey i guess this movie doesnt have credits time for bed
1470465 if there ever was a time that a precariously close to inhumane work environment could go over the edge this new production ramp would be it
1470466 a large number of beds and lockers in an open space and from our perspective felt too impersonal the third contained triple bunks which in our opinion didnt provide reasonable personal space
1470467 but now that 2 0 1 is here the allure of bug fixes is almost irresistible although upgrading comes with the loss of the jailbreak at least for now

1470477 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1470478 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1470479 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1470480 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1470481 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term

1470483 when everybody starts to learn the system i think well be fine
1470484 i dont think there will be a problem at all
1470485 just keep that center off that linebacker come off low and keep leverage on the center
1470486 those are big shoes to fill with dykes and dingle leaving they did a hell of a job in there last year and im trying to fill that spot and do the best job i can
1470487 but with coach casteel and coach kirlav staying here i was real happy about that with coach kirlav im a little more comfortable here because ive known him going into my third year and he recruited me so im tighter with him than other coaches i was definitely happy
1470488 dont get me wrong were good now we just got to work on the little things and get a lot of the fundamentals in we have to work as a team and we have to be real cohesive when were out there that will come over time
1470489 shooting the hands is important for interior lineman like myself and working on moves to get around the center and guard everybodys really working on their speed agility and endurance were known as a fast team so we want to just keep it that way and play fast on the field
1470490 when youre a freshman you got to work on technique stance and coming off the ball
1470491 from what me and scooter and doug slavonic saw we thought they did pretty good actually we worked with them in the summer but there was a lot of progression

1470498 coelho discovered the power of free when a fan posted a russian translation of one of his novels online and book sales there climbed from 3 000 to 100 000 to 1m in three years
1470499 this happened in english in norwegian in japanese and serbian
1470500 now when the book is released in hard copy the sales are spectacular
1470501 so coelho started linking to pirated versions of his books from his own website but when he bragged about this at the burda digital lifestyle design conference in munich last january he got in trouble with his us publisher harpercollins whose then head jane friedman called him
1470502 for coelho digital is about relationships the internet always is and he is revelling in the new connections it gives him with his readers he loves to meet them face to face he mentioned on his blog that hed like to invite a few readers to a party in a remote town in spain and he was shocked that they were willing to fly in from as far away as japan now he regularly invites readers to his parties
1470503 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1470504 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1470505 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1470506 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city

1470508 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1470509 it looks like scientists have totally botched the count of the number of gorillas left in the world
1470510 that helped count polar bears to list them as threatened maybe a visit to the arctic to actually count the polar bears should be in order
1470511 well nothing has happened we dont have to worry about it
1470512 im not going to go into the depths of what it was over
1470513 its something that happened ive been playing with manny since rookie ball its not like we hate each other at least i dont i apologize for the way it went down i definitely could have handled it better but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i have for the game
1470514 i cant take it back i could have handled it better but i dont apologize for the full meaning behind it and the fire
1470515 were not in middle school we should be able to get over it
1470516 stuff happens unfortunately were on tv so of course it looks bad for me its over with everybody came in today and seems the same i think were good what happened happened sometimes it gets a little heated especially in a pennant race
1470517 its a fine line always after the fact you say how you could have done something if i was that good id be president or something ive made mistakes but like i said i dont apologize for my passion for the game every now and then i get a little too excited
1470518 non hustle being late disrespecting the game in terms of hot dogging no hustling those types of things
1470519 its not a major ordeal theres a shock factor to it but people dont understand that theres a lot of stuff that happens over the course of an eight month season when youve got guys that live together and play together and trust each other theres a lot of stuff that goes on that you never see or hear about on every team it just happened to be on tv
1470520 its over were handling it in our own way were past all this i know what happened i know the issue they had a disagreement or misunderstanding its not anything thats going to linger or continue price has apologized and weve talked to manny
1470521 these are competitive issues he competes so hard people say how can you do that but the thing that our fans more than anything else when i first got here what they wanted was a competitive team now when theyve got guys that compete they get upset when things like that happen
1470522 when i first got here what they wanted was a competitive team now when theyve got guys that compete they get upset when things like that happen
1470523 asked what would warrant removing a player from the lineup yost said
1470524 asked what would warrant removing a player from the lineup yost said non hustle being late disrespecting the game in terms of hot dogging no hustling those types of things
1470525 as for prince go talk to parra hes like 15 feet away if it were that important you would have done it by now
1470526 but the thing that our fans more than anything else when i first got here what they wanted was a competitive team now when theyve got guys that compete they get upset when things like that happen
1470527 who is the most hated man in wisconsin sports right now
1470528 ive probably seen more than 5 000 individual tennis matches
1470529 and mom has seen nearly every one of them too
1470530 shes not only a great fan but also a great pair of extra eyes she has been an invaluable help at times and really can tell me whats going on im very fortunate to have her help
1470531 i think shes fantastic i really think shes one of the best players in the state and could play in a national tournament she often plays against women about half her age
1470532 bob and i opened the tennis club in 1973 but we werent anything like the teaching pros they have at the club now
1470533 thats been one of the most rewarding things of my life seeing the club grow and prosper doug and robin robinson the current owners pay attention to all the details to everything that makes for an outstanding tennis experience
1470534 i just love the challenge and we have so many wonderful players at the tennis club there are a lot of older people there and its great fun its where i love to be
1470535 i remember we girls would have to play intramural basketball the old way with three girls on each side of the court when i could i would sneak off and play real basketball with the boys i remember when steve and stan were young i used to get out and play catch with them
1470536 i get up at 5 a m and im working out at 6 a m
1470537 im at the tennis club at 8 15 to play on the weekends i walk a lot and i lift weights in fact i lift weights when im watching tv if you dont use it you lose it
1470538 i went this last year but its a little bit differnt this year ive got 140 at bats at this point so not a whole lot of upside to this season for me as of right now
1470539 espns wendi nix that he was not going to practice he said there would be another meeting with his family and packers general manager ted thompson to discuss trade possibilities in hope of resolving the situation
1470540 a source involved in the discussions told espns ed werder that favre is talking to the
1470541 favre said the team once again rejected his request to talk to teams about a trade within the nfc north preferably to the minnesota vikings or possibly the chicago bears
1470542 pr man to what make your s t look like it doesnt stink it does
1470543 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1470544 can tt trade himself oh wait who would want him
1470545 brett favre is like a floater that just wont go down when you flush
1470546 one player is not bigger than the team dont you support the packers
1470547 now since bf is gone there will be many calling for tts head or even ars head if this season doesnt end in a superbowl victory expecting ar to play like a seasoned veteran is ridiculous he will have his growing pains he has conducted himself with the utmost class during this rather trying time and packer fans should show him the same class
1470548 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1470549 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1470550 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

1470558 one pill at the bottom was singing my favorite song
1470559 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1470560 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1470561 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1470562 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1470563 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1470564 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospect
1470565 it is more of the same from the iranians obfuscation and delays
1470566 it was not the type of response the international community was looking for
1470567 the letter handed over is not an answer to the offered package the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1470568 during the call jalili expressed his readiness to start formal talks

1470574 oh shit i really put my foot in it this time

1470576 wan azizah said she was shocked to see a picture of me being attacked by a group of men in the newspapers
1470577 wan azizah told me nampak gambar pun takut sebab orang itu big man she too would be afraid upon seeing the huge man in the picture she apologised profusely many times and said pkr would conduct an internal investigation on the matter
1470578 she said anwar was also angry with the security personnel because they were strict with the crowd when the people tried to shake hands with him
1470579 wan azizah said pkr had never stopped photographers from taking pictures and had reminded the security personnel not to obstruct photographers from doing their job as it was good for the party she also said she did not want a repeat of the incident
1470580 we reserve the right to seek legal action after this case we hope such incidents will not recur

1470582 id love to say that i went away from playing this with a head full of butterflies and lots of hyperbole to describe the epic brilliance of it however as the worm turns square appear to have lost the plot as to what sort of game they are making from the cinematics i saw the game looks the part beautifully motion captured and in no way as jerky and badly acted as final fantasy x was however the battle system has completely changed instead of the games old active time battle system of turn based combat that i personally have always liked we now have something very much similar to a simplified ffxi combat system my jaw dropped too so now you run around your enemy comically waiting and hitting them then they hit you like some sort of misguided and laggy everquest battle there is no more ritual to the battle which while some may enjoy as you now flow into battles as if you are playing zelda or say ffxi i personally believe that this is an enourmous dumbing down of the series and the first sign that final fantasy may be going in a very bad direction the story itself is something i really cannot comment on as the game was incomplete and wasnt prepared in the same format as the metal gear trailer but overall im very worried i have no doubt that ill buy it as the story looks good enough from what ive seen and it is quite fun to play but it doesnt seem it doesnt seem ff ish enough its hard to explain

1470584 ayn rands theory of man leads to a distinctive interpretation of history
1470585 it is obvious that most people have no articulate coherent philosophy

1470594 we will not have their deaths be in vain we will win this war
1470595 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1470596 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1470597 but the players arent 100 per cent yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1470598 normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1470599 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers he is one of his the managers major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully

1470613 republican study committee chairman jeb hensarling r texas and rep mike pence r ind asked president bush to convene a special session to force a vote on drilling in an aug 1 letter
1470614 the white house has rejected calls from house republicans that it convene a special session of congress on energy saying it wouldnt make a difference
1470615 but why doesnt the president who has the power to call congress back do so
1470616 well i urged him to do that last week ah along with jeb hensarling from texas we encouraged the president to use his article ii power to call congress back into session
1470617 on the bush white houses manufacture of evidence of wmds and the faking of a saddam hussein al qaeda connection the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1470618 we mislead you do your best to figure it out
1470619 theres a real irony going on here the worse the economy gets you would think it hurts bush and hurts the republicans i believe the worse the economy gets the more people get scared to death about what might happen if obama gets elected and raises taxes
1470620 mccain has not articulated a vision for the economy any different from what bush is doing
1470621 as the threat level arises both at home and abroad the economy and national security it becomes harder and harder to close your eyes and bet on obama everybody understands mccain is safe
1470622 and when obama says by the way that hes only gonna raise taxes on the rich thats like the captain of a ship saying the only room hes going to shut down is the engine room
1470623 say what you will about john mccain john mccains made tough decisions he sticks by them

1470631 the hope is it is preserved and is important to the community but there are no restrictions
1470632 that opens that up to possibilities of grants and gets other peoples attention

1470637 i didnt want to touch it or let it go free over there near lakes community high school in lake villa so i called police
1470638 we had to get it out so we scared it as best we could and it slithered out
1470639 we think it was either abandoned or escaped from a home near where fiocchi lives in antioch

1470661 i have really learned how to relax instead of tensing up when the ball gets to me i have improved that part of my game and that just makes me a more dangerous player
1470662 i think its real unique because all three of us are some of the more experienced guys on the team
1470663 me and brad are two fifth year seniors ben has been here three years and has played all three i think its real special that we have three leaders at running back

1470665 they expect you to lead by example and not only a vocal leader a lot of times its hard when that monkey is on your back but youre that older guy theyre going to look to during the game to make a big play you just have to do it out there in practice because you practice like you play
1470666 thats always going to be my number one goal i just want to impress the coaches with my talent not only just thinking i can run the ball with speed on the outside but i can hit the hole and carry the ball well and still catch it out of the backfield

1470755 labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1470756 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1470757 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth

1470770 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1470771 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years

1470775 i urge you to call congress back into session to use the august recess to legislate on energy in an effort to deal with the high cost of oil and gasoline at the pump
1470776 it is a hoax on the american people to say that we can only drill offshore
1470777 i dont think we would go down a path like this unless we saw something possible in the senate that the president would sign

1470788 there will be a clamour to be on the boards of good companies if we allow this
1470789 the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates has to be charged to the profit and loss account the standard has been notified by the government and is part of the rules any violation has to be dealt with by the government
1470790 companies are taking legal opinion to take shelter under the companies act because they dont want to take a hit a simple accounting treatment has manifested itself into a legal debate the companies regulator should modify the companies act said viren mehta director ernst amp young
1470791 though as11 talks of taking such gains and losses to the p amp l account we have been legally advised that in the case of difference or conflict between the provisions of an act and the rules the act shall prevail and the company should comply with the provisions of the companies act which requires these gains or losses to be adjusted against the value of fixed assets
1470792 the dichotomy is further complicated as mehta puts it with as ii being notified under the companies accounting standards rules 2006
1470793 i dont think theres any room for adding forex losses to the cost of fixed assets once a standard is notified its a rule its a legal issue it would be interesting to see if rules prevail over the law
1470794 companies are governed by the listing agreement that require them to follow the accounting standards why are stock exchanges not asking any questions asked a corporate observer
1470795 the three agencies sebi icai and the ministry of company affairs need to work in tandem so that theres no ambiguity
1470796 het vervelende is dat de gemeente barneveld dat wel doet
1470797 ik begrijp het wel barneveld heeft daar een bedrijventerrein en zo ze willen een groot station maar hoeveel tijdwinst heb je nou van een intercity daar

1470802 both bills would get the oil industry off its duff and get it to start producing oil from the 68 million acres of federal land both onshore and offshore for which it already possesses leases
1470803 there is a lot of activity here in hamilton county that is unprecedented we had almost 42 000 people over 60 of the total vote vote in the democratic primary here making us the 5th largest democratic county in the state the obama campaign had 5 offices here in the primary and will have 2 or 3 here by september pretty exciting stuff
1470804 just as a comparison look at the differences between general election years in the 2004 primary the winner john kerry received around 2 900 votes this year the winner obama received over 25 000 votes
1470805 theres another huge difference in the governors race even when comparing the primary results to the 2004 general election the increase in democratic turnout is huge
1470806 i think that obamas internals must be telling him that his place in the center is relatively safe for the general so he can for a relatively safe choice instead of a desperation hillary move of course are the polls telling them something about the indiana governors race that we arent seeing given the risk of throwing away a fairly safe democratic senate seat the fact that bayh is fairly tight with hillary should help him a great deal in southern indiana where hillary just mauled obama in the primary if i remember correctly
1470807 of course bayh is a lightweight but hes an experienced lightweight who is tightly allied with the hillary people judging by the joint letter he and obama sent to the va veterans administration about the terrible job the va is doing treating veterans head injuries perhaps bayh is going to be the attack dog on military affairs that sen jim webb virginia might have been if this is the ticket think of all the obama bayh ads that will run during the olympics two men of different races relatively the same age big generational symbolism
1470808 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it

1470812 i kept giving reports on what needs to be done and they kept ignoring my suggestions i got an idea that there was no will to change from within but i persisted hoping things would change especially after the events of april when the ihf was suspended
1470813 in the seventies india were the professional side and we were amateurs we whether it was australia or holland or spain learnt by watching the subcontinent teams and players because we were not too proud to do so india are i feel too proud to realise that they have stagnated while the rest of the world has moved ahead so they now need to watch and learn from others
1470814 every country has a different culture different system and i would be stupid to try and force something alien but what is common is practical video analysis and a compilation of database that belongs to the country not any individual the players know there is much more that they need and are not getting
1470815 i for one want to have nothing to do with money
1470816 in fact much before my appointment there were talks with a sponsor between the previous administration the sponsor had only two conditions that i come as coach and their man managing the accounts the deal fell through
1470817 why dont oil companies drill on the millions of acres where they already have leases

1470830 will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law
1470831 it is beyond me how one can possibly claim that a system whereby everyone your employer your union organizer and your co workers knows exactly how you vote on the issue of unionization gives an employee free choice
1470832 the employee free choice act would strip american workers of their right to a private ballot vote require companies to submit to binding arbitration and increase penalties for unfair labor practices committed by employers but not by unions each of these provisions would be bad for american workers
1470833 congress should instead protect the privacy of american workers and guarantee their right to vote in an election before joining a union congress should also guarantee every worker the opportunity to hear arguments from both sides and time to reflect before voting
1470834 we rarely showed workers what an actual union contract looked like because we knew that it wouldnt necessarily reflect what a worker would want to see
1470835 the union would provide the employees according to their priorities such as seniority or how much they favored that particular contractor
1470836 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word
1470837 the controversy isnt entirely surprising the point of beer pong is to get your friends drunk and parents and university administrators generally frown on that sort of thing last fall georgetown university banned beer pong specially made beer pong tables and inordinate numbers of ping pong balls and any other alcohol related paraphernalia in its on campus dorms even in the rooms of students of legal drinking age the university of pennsylvania yale university the university of massachusetts at amherst and tufts university have also banned drinking games were pleased that tufts has put this in writing says michelle bowdler a health administrator at the school although we understand that twenty one is the legal drinking age we dont want our students participating in activities that could do excessive harm to themselves or others

1470869 gambling only promotes laziness greed and excessive love for money which is the root of all evils i have always been against gambling be it legal or illegal i believe it robs the people

1470888 it is contrary and averse to every sentiment of pure american spirit it is contrary and averse to the very principles of a pure saxon government it is subversive of social peace no more voracious parasite ever sucked at the heart of pure society and moral status than the one which welcomes or recognizes everywhere the sacred ties of wedlock between africa and america

1470960 viele menschen haben angst davor gefilmt zu werden ich habe angst irgendwann einmal nicht mehr gefilmt zu werden
1470961 die kameraden die 18 30 uhr als erste eintrafen standen einer drei bis vier meter hohen flammenfront gegen ber die mehrere hundert meter breit war
1470962 es gelang schlie lich das feuer an einem feldweg zum stehen zu bringen
1470963 ein feldbrand dieses ausma es haben viele kameraden bisher nicht erlebt
1470964 alle experten sind sich einig wenn die erste injektion nicht klappt dann wird die hinrichtung entsetzlich sein

1470966 f r mein n chstes projekt berlege ich kamele f r reiche leute aus dem nahen osten zu klonen
1470967 ein klassischer investor w re gut f r die marke
1470968 es gibt keine hinweise von den banken oder anhand gestiegener aktienums tze dass ein investor aufgetaucht ist
1470969 solange ein investor nicht die zerschlagung des unternehmens plant ist der einstieg nicht verwerflich
1470970 ich halte es f r eher unwahrscheinlich dass ein klassischer hedgefonds der eine marke kauft um sie zu zerschlagen aktien erworben hat zwar hat die marke daimler viele teilsparten wie mercedes benz cars oder vans die man auf den ersten blick gut separat verkaufen k nnte allerdings w rden diese einzelpakete enorm an wert verlieren wenn man sie trennt
1470971 nein es ist nicht unrealistisch dass ein investor daimler aktien in gr erem stil gekauft hat und es w re auch nicht schlecht das kann ein reicher russe oder araber oder chinese sein der die marke daimler am aktienmarkt f r unterbewertet h lt und ihren wert durch optimierungen im konzern steigern will
1470972 da gibt es einige strategien zum beispiel k nnte der konzern mehr aktien herausgeben um die bernahme zu erschweren oder er kauft bereits herausgegebene aktien zur ck im ernstfall haben sich konzerne in der vergangenheit auch der hilfe eines sogenannten wei en ritters bedient das bedeutet dieser wei e ritter macht zum beispiel ein konkurrierendes bernahmeangebot f r das unternehmen und bewahrt es so vor einer zerschlagung
1470973 kauft ein investor ein gro es aktien paket treibt das den aktienkurs nach oben deshalb kauft bei so einem ger cht jeder schnell noch aktien weil er auf die wertsteigerung spekuliert
1470974 im gegensatz zu anderen deutschen automobilherstellern ist die daimler ag nicht durch einen gro aktion r gesch tzt mehr als 92 der aktien sind im streubesitz nur das emirat kuwait ist mit einem anteil von 7 6 gro aktion r die deutsche bank fr her ein gro aktion r h lt heute nur noch rund drei prozent

1470982 there is no evidence to suggest the type of music you listen to will cause you to commit suicide but those who are vulnerable and at risk of committing suicide may be listening to certain types of music
1470983 but its important to point out that music doesnt cause these behaviours
1470984 its more a case of teenagers who may have a mental illness or are involved in these antisocial behaviours being drawn to certain types of music
1470985 over the years there have been concerns about suicidal themes in some music and whenever a famous person such as nirvana singer kurt cobain kills themselves we see a copycat effect among teenagers
1470986 but sometimes an adolescents musical tastes will reveal nothing the key to understanding any teenager is to treat them with respect by listening to what they have to say rather than typecasting them according to the type of music they listen to

1471029 with the economy down and the cost of living up new yorkers cant afford a fare hike two years in a row to keep public transportation affordable and reliable we need more city and state aid for mass transit
1471030 over the last 30 years public transportation in new york has seen an incredible revival
1471031 with gas prices up and mta ridership booming now is not the time for city and the state to abandon transit riders and the mta public transportation can meet the needs of a growing city but not without adequate public investment
1471032 with the cost of living skyrocketing in new york working people cant afford fare hikes two years in a row but simple math says without proper aid from the state and city transit riders will end up picking up the tab

1471070 la industria mantuvo en los primeros siete meses del a o una tendencia sostenida en materia de producci n exportaci n y ventas merced al desarrollo del sector sobre la base de las importantes inversiones formuladas a lo largo de los ltimos a os que no s lo ha permitido satisfacer la demanda interna sino tambi n acceder a nuevos mercados externos y ampliar la oferta en los tradicionales tanto en cantidad como en calidad los datos de julio confirman esa capacidad de respuesta y elasticidad de la industria local que export casi el 63 de su producci n
1471071 ello no hace m s que reafirmar el perfil exportador que adquiri el sector y que impone el sostenido esfuerzo de todos los actores de la cadena de valor para mantener la competitividad

1471083 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1471084 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1471085 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1471086 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1471087 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1471088 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1471089 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1471090 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1471091 while the articles highlight different causes they are unanimous in concluding that talent is the new oil and just like oil demand far outstrips supply

1471093 what the u s can learn from indian r amp d
1471094 the achievements of companies in india show that employee investment development and empowerment are central and critical means to building and sustaining long term competitiveness and innovation capacities in a global knowledge economy
1471095 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1471096 its hawkish enough for people who are concerned about inflation but the fact that there are dissenters proves that this opinion is not unanimous
1471097 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1471098 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1471099 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1471100 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1471101 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1471102 the brazilian army does not serve the government but rather the brazilian state
1471103 the question here is much bigger than the state of roraima its a question of national integration
1471104 not just on the part of indians but from land grabbers prospectors and loggers who would take it as a signal that reservations could be invaded
1471105 if they decide against us it would be the worst thing that can happen to indigenous people across brazil
1471106 those people the settlers think their contribution to the economy and their control of the local institutions make them right
1471107 if we take the concept of prior occupation too far
1471108 we will have to hand my marvelous city of rio de janeiro over to the indians
1471109 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

1471112 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1471113 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1471114 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1471115 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

1471118 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1471119 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1471120 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1471121 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1471122 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1471123 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1471124 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1471125 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1471126 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1471127 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1471128 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1471129 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1471130 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1471131 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1471132 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1471133 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1471134 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1471135 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1471136 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1471137 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1471138 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1471139 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1471140 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1471141 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1471142 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1471143 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1471144 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1471145 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute

1471179 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1471180 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1471181 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1471182 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters

1471315 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1471316 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1471350 access to a 200 million market that were not really present in at the moment
1471351 what were trying to take advantage of is that boston scientific isnt very focused on gastroenterology right now theyre very focused on cardiology so we havent seen a lot of innovation or a lot of spending in the gastrointestinal gi space
1471352 so were trying to take advantage of that opportunity to be very creative and innovative in the gi market and one of the biggest opportunities we see at the moment is in gi stenting
1471353 i think that what happened with boston is that once they purchased schneider they became dominant and they didnt focus on this area from an innovation perspective and that gives us the opportunity to come in with some very innovative technology
1471354 we needed to come to market with breakthrough technology in gi stenting that would position us differently than our competition
1471355 the general feedback we got was that there hasnt been a huge amount of innovation in this market
1471356 people were saying that the stents have performed reasonably well but there were a number of problems they felt hadnt been overcome and a number of things theyd like to see improved
1471357 the physicians want very controlled release of the stents rather then starting off and then not having a way to control the rate at which the stent deploys
1471358 what we wanted was a rapid uptake of this new technology and we didnt want price to be a hurdle

1471360 there were aspects of our core diagnostics business in particular that were struggling that were in difficulty and that had to be addressed
1471361 we spent the last 12 months doing a realistic assessment of where our business is and the things we have to do
1471362 they had gone through a process of becoming accustomed to the idea of being a part of general electric and in late july of last year they were told that was not going to happen
1471363 we struggled mightily with our ability to do things that we used to do better than anyone else in the industry which is to deliver whatever the customer ordered all of the time
1471364 we have had a lot of inquiries in the last 12 months about whether abbott would sell these businesses
1471365 we have given a very consistent response the answer is we are not going to sell the businesses
1471366 the reason for that is we have had the opportunity having gone through the process with general electric and over the last 12 months to really reflect on the true value that the businesses can add
1471367 thinking of the history of the diagnostics franchise it has been quite some time since we have been able to claim that position in the abbott portfolio
1471368 we have a number of older platforms that have been on the market for frankly decades
1471369 our customers have been reliant on those assays and those systems partly because we have not had good alternatives for them
1471370 that has begun to change as our menu has expanded and we now have the ability to go to customers and talk to them about moving from old technology to new technology
1471371 we have made tremendous improvements in our ability to do just the simple things such as filling our customers orders with the products they want and with the timeliness that they need
1471372 we have to sustain that because if we now take two steps backwards customers are going to think that it was just a minor improvement a blip a temporary solution
1471373 that is one of the most important things our operations team is working on
1471374 if we can sustain it people will realize that abbott is back up to what it used to be in terms of a reliable supply of products

1471405 were proud at shermanstravel media that the market is recognizing and embracing our unique contributions to the travel space both in print and online our online visitors and our print subscribers value the intelligence behind our content our diversity of offerings and the comprehensive expert advice that we give them this combination distinguishes us from all of the other travel media out there today

1471409 we anticipate that adjusted diluted net earnings per share for our second fiscal quarter of 2009 will be between 0 49 and 0 53 which excludes the expected additional charge of approximately 1 2 million or 0 02 per share from the continuation of our european restructuring actions

1471445 we believe we are benefitting from our focus on the high end of the portable electronic device market which is where certain customers are seeing strong demand for their new products
1471446 during the third quarter our gross margin was negatively impacted by investments to expand our production capacity and temporary inefficiencies caused by adding and transferring manufacturing personnel to programs that are ramping in volume while the new programs have had an adverse effect on gross margins we believe they provide us with good visibility on continued near term revenue and earnings growth as the programs mature and we deepen our relationship with these oems
1471447 the new satellite facility will enable us to bring on additional just in time capacity to accommodate the increased manufacturing volumes we are projecting in the near term
1471448 we anticipate that our continued progress on mfc3 will ultimately provide the capacity to expand our volume of business with current customers as well as more aggressively pursue new oem relationships

1471461 the second quarter was strong for neustar from a revenue profitability and cash flow perspective this reflects npac transaction growth and the initial benefits of our cost control measures we are also seeing continued growth in ultra services and common short codes as well as revenue and operational progress at ngm where we now have launches completed at 75 of the 36 mobile network operators under contract

1471476 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
1471477 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
1471478 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
1471479 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
1471480 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
1471481 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
1471482 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
1471483 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
1471484 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
1471485 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
1471486 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
1471487 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
1471488 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
1471489 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
1471490 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
1471491 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
1471492 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
1471493 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
1471494 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
1471495 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
1471496 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
1471497 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
1471498 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
1471499 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
1471500 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
1471501 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
1471502 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
1471503 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
1471504 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential

1471509 since i was released from prison on april 22 2007 my decision and my commitment is to stay in cuba to fight for democracy and the freedom of my homeland
1471510 i do not accept any pressure or blackmail to leave my country and i hold the castro government and its sinister political police responsible for my worsening health because of the lack of medical attention
1471511 every child who has had their results delayed should receive an apology
1471512 i find the use of police in riot gear incomprehensible and i think it was a mistake
1471513 a large proportion have not said they are going to break the law as far as i am aware
1471514 one of the things we want to avoid in circumstances such as these is provocation and i think that it was
1471515 in the camp reprehensibly were found a number of smoke grenades they have been confiscated should be confiscated and the people that kept them should be prosecuted
1471516 of course i dont condone breaking the law thats the whole point what is happening at the moment is not breaking the law
1471517 the protesters were hostile to the police so much so that officers had to use their personal protective equipment
1471518 it is essential that the two access points to the site are kept clear of obstructions so that the emergency services can get immediate access to the site or carry out an evacuation if needed
1471519 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on
1471520 lets just try this once more and if its the last one thats hard lines

1471522 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1471523 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1471524 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1471525 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1471526 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders
1471527 while i was waiting for him he emptied the contents out of the corners of three or four bottles to get a shot

1471530 he called everyone he knew to send him a ticket to get him out of antigua
1471531 the idea was it would feel like he was one on one with whoever the woman was

1471539 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1471540 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1471541 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1471542 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1471543 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1471544 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1471545 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1471546 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1471547 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
1471548 while i was waiting for him he emptied the contents out of the corners of three or four bottles to get a shot
1471549 he was trying to act like he didnt know i was coming that day
1471550 i told him he can do whatever he wants but im getting on a plane
1471551 he called everyone he knew to send him a ticket to get him out of antigua
1471552 the idea was it would feel like he was one on one with whoever the woman was

1471554 there was no point in me changing club for a team that was a similar size to celtic but one which does not always make the champions league or have 60 000 fans behind you to me there is no point when i have all that at celtic im really happy in my football and in my life right now i have a new child and things are settled with my football and thats good the aim for this season is simple win the title again for the fourth season and then do better in the champions league
1471555 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1471556 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1471557 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1471558 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1471559 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1471560 thats not giving him mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1471561 it will be used as more propaganda by the taliban was more evidence that afghans are not getting anything from the international mission
1471562 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1471563 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1471564 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1471565 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1471566 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1471567 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1471568 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1471569 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1471570 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together

1471574 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1471575 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1471576 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1471577 oh just some decent cheese and a few bits and pieces
1471578 peak oil has long been a reality for the oil industry
1471579 if you talk to industry leaders they concede we are facing a decline in liquid fuels the battle is over the peakists have won
1471580 the current solutions being bantered about are inadequate to the conditions we are faced with
1471581 we must embrace adaptation strategies that immediately create whole new ways of being in relationship to each other and the planet buy local get off of hydrocarbons in every aspect of your life gather in community and espouse only love your grandchildrens lives depend on it
1471582 in 1995 petroconsultants published a report for oil industry insiders 32 000 per copy titled world oil supply 1930 2050 which concludes that world oil extraction could peak as soon as the year 2000 and decline to half that level by 2025 large and permanent increases in oil prices were predicted after the year 2000
1471583 peak oil and climate change are a bigger threat together than either are alone peak oil and climate change must be fused as issues an approach is needed to deal with them as a package
1471584 the confluence of peak oil and climate change means that it is now time to ask ourselves as a species the biggest questions we can so lets ask those questions now what do we want to achieve with our remaining oil and gas resources what do we want our legacy to be what are we aiming towards as a species and does that meet what we want to achieve as individuals how do we want to achieve this do we want to make the transition as easy as possible do we eschew personal responsibility and have blind faith that the markets or technology will solve everything thus putting off doing anything it simply does not make sense to expand the use of energy resources that will increase climate change if our ability to deal with those magnified consequences will be even more depleted further down the road
1471585 community is a vision of the future where we conserve and share scarce local resources rather than deplete destroy and battle over seemingly abundant distance resources
1471586 it is a vision where we consume far fewer resources but have a better life filled with valued relationships rather than valued possessions
1471587 worlds foremost experts on issues of peak oil gas and coal local and ecological economics sustainable lifestyles community overconsumption and more
1471588 as we try to determine what the most effective structural and lifestyle changes are to reducing home energy use
1471589 revamping local and regional economies living working and shopping in the same area well be able to utilize the more sustainable options of walking bicycling and mass transit
1471590 when we shift to using fewer fossil fuels start to repair and rebuild the damaged soil and grow more real food well need vastly more human labor to do it
1471591 this includes more full time farmers for sure but all of us producing some food is the most efficient sustainable and secure agriculture
1471592 i believe that this is how the change will take place not from above but from within
1471593 from individuals and communities and eventually entire nations pioneering a better way to live on this planet
1471594 powering down for the future toward an international movement for systemic change new economies of sustainability equity sufficiency and peace
1471595 these are milestones that these kids are reaching when theyre here
1471596 fifteen or 20 years from now when its sitting up on a shelf covered in dust theyll look back on it at the end of the day my feeling is that this is all about building memories
1471597 we always try to do that for the home run boys because that means a lot to hit a home run here
1471598 i think the children when they get the ball they love to have it
1471599 and make sure the parents dont get in the way

1471604 lignite and hard coal energy suppliers for world needs until the year 2100 an outlook
1471605 i t is important to estimate expected atmospheric co2 levels for realistic estimates of fossil fuel reserves and to determine how the co2 level depends upon possible constraints on coal use
1471606 peak oil emission occurs in 2016 2 yr peak gas in 2026 2 yr and peak coal in 2077 2 yr
1471607 is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions
1471608 e ven if coal reserves are much lower than historically assumed there is surely enough coal to take the world past 450 ppm co2 without mitigation efforts such as those described here
1471609 our producer limited profile has future fossil fuel production that is lower than all 40 of the ipcc scenarios so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling
1471610 the producer limited profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070
1471611 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own

1471613 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1471614 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1471638 any war worth its salt deserves a nifty conspiracy theory and the war on terrorism is no exception
1471639 the problem isnt so much that slate is center right the problem is that it is regarded as center left despite being if anything center right and that the same pattern is repeated regarding other media institutions
1471640 enough people in the business have gotten in touch with me in a hurry to dispute the idea that slate is a center right publication
1471641 we cant allow writers who do nothing but criticize left of center views from the right be defined as moderates much less left of center thats ridiculous
1471642 go back and look at the slate archives for the 2004 presidential election it basically gives the answer many of the writers openly voted for bush and the ones that voted for kerry all felt the need to qualify their support
1471643 many of the writers openly voted for bush and the ones that voted for kerry all felt the need to qualify their support
1471644 ive noticed that a lot of people in the field of journalism have a tendency to judge the political proclivities of a publication by the subjective mental states of the staff the correct way however is to look at whats on the pages

1471654 its an obsession he has with the canadian wheat board
1471655 would allow advertising across all electoral districts by third parties which would promote eligible voters to become fully informed about the future direction of the board during the election of its directors
1471656 create an environment for a robust and fulsome exchange of information and points of view on key issues
1471657 this could undermine the integrity of the election process and perception of fairness
1471658 this government is working to provide producers with a maximum amount of information allowing them to make informed choices at the ballot box
1471659 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society of course there are many courageous individuals but they have no determining influence on public life political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice and decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and weak countries not supported by anyone or with currents which cannot offer any resistance but they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists should one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
1471660 the crystal is a neutral object whose inner structure exhibits a state of perfection and balance like a laser it radiates energy in a coherent highly concentrated form and this energy may be transmitted into objects or people at will with proper training a healer using a crystal can release negative thoughtforms which have taken shape as disease patterns
1471661 the fact that the same effects were found with both genuine and fake crystals undermines any claims that crystals have the mysterious powers which they are claimed to have instead the power of suggestion either explicit or implicit seems to be the not so mysterious power that may convince many that crystals have the potential to work miracles

1471668 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1471669 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1471670 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1471671 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1471672 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours

1471792 its frustrating to see every urban initiative opposed by spacing infill and intensification is condemned as vertical sprawl or for gentrification new transit designed to take the most car dependent travelers off urban highways is villified the only alternatives offered are as viable as offering unicorns for everyone

1471807 we have the best prepared british team weve ever had the investment has gone in and its time for delivery sutcliffe said we are looking forward to meeting the uk sport target of 41 medals

1471826 the brasher doubloon was struck in 1787 by president washingtons new york neighbor silversmith and well known political figure of the day ephraim brasher for much of the 20th century the coin was owned by the family of baltimore and ohio railroad executive t harrison garrett and later by the johns hopkins university our company acquired it at a public auction in early 2005 and since then weve underwritten public educational exhibits across the country

1471833 i remember seeing the great clubs that won the european cup back to back and that is the gauntlet that we have thrown down to ourselves
1471834 to become a really great team is what we want
1471835 if we can get back to that final and win it again then we can start talking about being a really great team as of now we are a team that has been successful but we still have a lot more to give

1471840 chelsea are growing and if we win one or two big competitions im sure we will have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or 10 years maybe in 20 or 50 years
1471841 i say i will try maybe mourinho says i win and afterwards if he does not win it causes problems because the manager is not playing its the players who play and if they make a mistake you then have to say it is the players who are bad and i will never do that never
1471842 you are the man who must take the responsibility mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me i am from south brazil we are different in my culture i never say i will win this this or that never
1471843 now they dont spend money the same as before because they already have a base

1471849 the boat loves a bit of wind that was how she was designed so she is proving what we knew but until now had no chance to demonstrate
1471850 we got lucky in this particular bug because its a design flaw
1471851 it shows up in everyones network but the fix is a design fix that doesnt point directly at what were improving
1471852 it took a couple of hours to find the bug
1471853 this is about the integrity of the web this is about the integrity of e mail
1471854 its more but i cant talk about how much more

1471868 did he thats the first time i am hearing that i didnt know that i guess i am definitely doing the 100 metres as well then
1471869 thats the first time there has been a miscommunication between us i hope it doesnt happen again
1471870 no its all down to hard work dedication and a competitive spirit
1471871 it doesnt happen by accident we train and race very hard jamaican people are like that in other aspects of life as well
1471872 just look at the quality of the opposition i would be lining up against in the 100m the world champion and the former world record holder
1471873 the event always closest to my heart i have spent my life running it
1471874 asafa congratulated me when i met him soon after and also thanked me for taking the pressure off him we are good friends and proud jamaicans although we have to run for ourselves on the track
1471875 it means a lot to us and is a day to talk and reminisce together i will still train but back home it is a day to do nothing and relax
1471876 it would be hard for us to arrange for spectators to leave the venue in time before the next batch of spectators arrive for the evening session in that circumstance the competition will be run without spectators
1471877 if it happens itll be just like being at home no one there watches the dressage anyway

1471884 when i was younger i used to watch the track and field a lot but for me seeing agassi win gold was awesome its an honour and a privilege to get this opportunity and hopefully i can replicate what he did when he won his gold medal
1471885 to get the opportunity to take part in such a huge competition is fantastic
1471886 im feeling good all the worlds top players are going to be there but on my current form theres no reason why i cant challenge for a medal
1471887 its a big sacrifice but to be involved in the olympics is a rare opportunity very few athletes can say they have done it in their career and i think im playing enough to do well

1471894 whenever you look at earnings you have to question what it means going forward and you have to appreciate what ceos have done in this kind of operating environment

1471900 salaries in grand cayman and bermuda are extremely competitive and the fact that little or no tax deductions puts net salaries far in excess of what can be expected in london in fact
1471901 candidates who make the move find that there is also a more conducive working environment where the number of hours worked isnt the most important thing
1471902 in principle we have no problem with the notion of opening embassies in syria and lebanon of course some interpret the lack of embassies as lack of recognition but syria currently has only 50 embassies worldwide does this mean that there are 131 countries that we refuse to recognize that does not make sense but if lebanon wants to open embassies we have no objection
1471903 i have emphasized this several times in the past including in
1471904 today we spoke of this and said that there were legal steps that must be initiated by president suleiman and by the lebanese government which we have not yet contacted about this we will decide what the required steps are
1471905 the only thing that has not changed is syrian policy the main thing that has changed is u s europe relations about a year ago many european leaders began to form a vision different from that of the u s in private meetings they told us that they had lost their faith in the vision of the current u s administration which had placed the europeans in a difficult situation and had undermined western interests in the middle east and in other parts of the world the western countries tried to present a united front on various issues but that was not the true face of things we knew this and then the french president came and declared it openly
1471906 syrias attitude towards lebanon has not changed despite what has happened
1471907 our neighbor twin state which is stable and united under a national unity government
1471908 this was not normalization since relations between the two countries were already natural and did not require normalization
1471909 must be resolved in beirut or in syria and not anywhere else
1471910 syrian lebanese relations are a subject for bilateral talks between these two twin states and we will not agree to any interference by a third party i do not know whether you syrians are interested in opening embassies we are determined to take this step and to exchange diplomats but this willingness must exist on both sides
1471911 nothing is preventing us from drawing the border but we must consider the interests of the syrian and lebanese population in the villages on the border will the border benefit them or not we know that many lebanese villagers study work and have fields on the syrian side of the border but if there is no choice but to draw borders we are willing to do so
1471912 if things progressed well crossing the border would be even easier than before
1471913 the legal status of the relations between the two countries must be examined and adapted to the changing circumstances
1471914 there is no subject that cannot be discussed between brothers and no issue
1471915 in reality there is nothing new in the announcement of a diplomatic
1471916 under the pretext of normalizing relations some lebanese are planning to take advantage of syria however this will not happen no matter how much they demonstrate curse threaten or incite against it arent they asking for relations of equality if so they must be equal in the full sense of this word i e they must be based on common interests rather than come at the expense of syria syria has paid enough in blood in economic loss and in foreign policy the time is ripe for real equality which will first be manifested in the exchange of ambassadors and the establishment of diplomatic representations and will then extend to economic relations as well
1471917 this means that lebanon will have to take steps to
1471918 contrary to what the march 14 forces and their followers believe if a
1471919 it is inconceivable that following suleimans visit syria will be
1471920 it is equally inconceivable that lebanon would insist that syria fulfill
1471921 formally there has been a change in lebanese syrian relations
1471922 syrias recognition of lebanon as an independent state rather than as a
1471923 the important question is when will this recognition be implemented by
1471924 at present damascus can take its time before beginning implementation
1471925 at the end of his visit to the presidential palace in baabda
1471926 what about lebanon and the lebanese the lebanese still retain the freedom
1471927 syrian president doha accord victory for syria and lebanon economic reform in syria more urgent than political reform syria has an opposition that can criticize the government it is just not legal yet
1471928 the results from american physicians insurance company our medical malpractice subsidiary continue to be excellent while we did not have the one time gain we enjoyed last year or the same degree of favorable development in our claims reserves we are pleased that we exceeded the analysts consensus estimate and that our gross written premium showed a quarter over quarter increase indications of our continued strong operating performance book value per share has benefited from this consistently superior performance increasing from 15 17 at june 30 2007 to 17 19 at december 31 2007 and 17 88 at june 30 2008
1471929 equally consistent with the financial results has been our application of a conservative reserving philosophy our historical pattern of reserving at the upper end of the actuarial range even during periods of favorable claim patterns has lead to recurring favorable quarterly reserve adjustments a pattern that should continue to repeat given the current claims environment our overall reserves for all reporting periods remain at the upper end of the range after recognizing 8 6 million of favorable development during the quarter just ended our accounting policy for investments has been no less conservative we have no auction rate securities or sub prime mortgage securities but have been writing our lowest rated alt a mortgage backed securities down to market due to the extended mortgage crisis even with these adjustments total cash and marketable securities has grown to over 225 million
1471930 our financial services business had a record year in 2007 but has not been immune to the general trend in the financial services arena and has reported losses in 2008 we have taken a number of steps to reduce costs and the resultant savings will begin to have an impact over the remainder of the year while our financial services business no longer constitutes a significant amount of our overall operations since the acquisition of our insurance subsidiary we continue to explore ways to reduce costs and return the segment to profitability
1471931 good results and a well managed balance sheet ultimately lead to shareholder value and we were pleased to pay our fifth consecutive common stock dividend at the close of the quarter we maintained our 30 per share rate even with our expanded shareholder base we also paid a dividend on our preferred shares and redeemed approximately 1 million of these shares at the same time we look forward to reporting our progress as we move into the second half of 2008
1471932 construction of our rodemacher unit 3 project continues to go well and has exceeded expectations
1471933 as a result of this progress cleco power and shaw amended the engineering procurement and construction epc contract to move up the substantial completion date to june 30 2009 as of june 30 2008 we have spent roughly 772 million of the billion dollar budget
1471934 we are maintaining our 2008 earnings target at a range of 1 60 to 1 70 per share
1471935 those targets assume 2008 capital expenditures of about 265 million on the rodemacher project including afudc normal weather for the remainder of the year and the continuation of our current rate plan cleco midstream earnings targets assume continued performance by evangelines tolling counterparty and are based on assumptions about acadias plant operations and market conditions
1471936 we continue to meet and exceed our operational targets with respect to each of our major initiatives
1471937 our rodemacher unit 3 project is on schedule to meet its original commercial operations date of october 2009 and could possibly be on as early as june 30 2009 as evidenced by the amendment of the epc contract with shaw
1471938 equally important in july 2008 we filed our first full rate case in over 20 years our filing enables us to maintain the parallel paths between the rodemacher 3 project and the rate case
1471939 also in the regulatory arena the long term rfp process is on track to select winning bids this month although results will not likely be public until late 2008 or early 2009
1471940 finally we continue to move forward in collaboration with our neighboring utilities as well as the southwest power pool and the louisiana public service commission to develop a comprehensive transmission solution for the southern part of our service territory
1471941 pet product marketers ignoring the natural pet channel do so at their own peril
1471942 for several years as of 2008 natural supermarkets have significantly outperformed more traditional counterparts similarly the pet departments of natural supermarket retailers are far outperforming those of most other retail channels and there is ample room for these departments to expand
1471943 we are generally satisfied with our results in the second quarter
1471944 despite the challenging market and economic conditions the casual dining sector is facing and the poor weather experienced in march and april we are maintaining our track record of generating overall positive same store sales growth and remain confident that our ongoing initiatives to enhance our menus service and guest experience will continue to attract and retain customers while building our presence across the country
1471945 we expect apple will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow
1471946 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1471947 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1471948 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1471949 the monday meeting was a reminder that somebody does not become vice chairman of goldman sachs without strong leadership and financial skills
1471950 he seems to have the exact capital market skills that wachovia needs for the next one to two years
1471951 steel made a good first impression he brings a set of fresh eyes and an objective view
1471952 the market seems to be reacting somewhat favorably to the idea the fed will not raise interest rates any time soon it appears that the fed has actually taken a little more of a dovish stance speaking more about the downside risks to growth
1471953 they couldnt have picked a worse time to get into the automobile business domestically
1471954 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
1471955 despite an image of decline more people today in more places read the content produced in the newsrooms of american daily newspapers than at any time in years
1471956 of course maybe someone stole it copied the data and then put it back nothing to see her
1471957 how long before they are all killed arent humans marvellous
1471958 yeah awesome neato but not everyone will need to utilize all that prettiness form vs function
1471959 10 try again this list is very conservative and not much longer or more high end than your a
1471960 hey i always checked sneakers for feet and mysterious black plastic bags filled with heavy
1471961 of course maybe someone stole it copied the data and then put it back
1471962 while the temporary tax credit is certainly a positive for buyers who purchase a home before july 2009 the tax credit does not offset the elimination of the down payment assistance program which our industry so vitally needs
1471963 heres this candidates voting record and military record did you know this one has a medical degree
1471964 the inclusion of carbon capture at bow city is the right thing to do a new power project in alberta must incorporate the best available technologies economically achievable from the outset in order to be both socially and personally acceptable
1471965 we look forward to a long and mutually beneficial business relationship with hoku
1471966 we evaluated many potential polysilicon manufacturers and are very confident in our selection of hoku as one of our key suppliers

1471980 while the commercial hosting market is no doubt a burgeoning space the requirement to manage customer acquisition costs in this competitive market has become a key success factor to profitable growth
1471981 though we are clearly pleased with our success to date our strategy has been to focus our efforts on implementing innovative methods of lowering our customer acquisition costs while at the same time increasing our rate of growth we firmly believe that the acquisition of this top ranked industry relevant website aligns well with this strategic focus

1471990 the combination of suse linux enterprise server and lotus foundations represents a significant step forward in the simplification of this environment it provides an affordable reliable easy to use software appliance for small and medium businesses and opens new opportunities for business partners to simplify the development and deployment of software applications for those same companies were excited to further extend our close partnership with ibm and be selected as the first company to deliver solutions for this important initiative the next wave of software delivery is here
1471991 i was there from the beginning when ibm lotus domino was being considered for a nitix offering and provided input on the necessary steps to deploy applications into an integrated domino server i never envisioned it to become such a simple process with wizard drive interfaces
1471992 domino isvs are excited about this because it opens a new market opportunity them to sell domino applications to small businesses
1471993 because this is a software appliance these applications can be deployed into environments that may not have on site domino administrators suddenly the sky is the limit for domino developers
1471994 mid market businesses typically have lean it organizations which can limit their ability to migrate their applications as their needs grow
1471995 ibms linux based software appliances provide a fully integrated solution from the operating system to the application and everything in between for our business partners to deploy in each customers environment the software appliances reduce the complexity of deploying new applications by minimizing the installation and configuration process business partners can move into higher value services more quickly helping grow their revenue
1471996 by working with ibm on a software appliance solution stradasoft can free up its technical consultants from sales and train its business consultants to do the job instead
1471997 the appliance solution reduces installation time for our customers from one to two days to only a few hours
1471998 smx is one of the strongest opportunities for networking and education available in the search marketing industry
1471999 that yahoo introduces contextual display ad targeting to rightmedia exchange
1472000 it says something subtle about someone who displays a vizio as opposed to a samsung sony sharp
1472001 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
1472002 these days if you happen to be a poet you have to sing your words to get your ideas out
1472003 poetry is superior to painting in the presentation of words and painting is superior to poetry in the presentation of facts for this reason i judge painting to be superior to poetry
1472004 the greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions
1472005 we are so lightly here it is in love that we are made in love we disappear
1472006 for some time before and especially since my last departure from england both in public and private by preaching and printing you have been propagating the doctrine of universal redemption and when i remember how paul reproved peter for his dissimulation i fear i have been sinfully silent too long o then be not angry with me dear and honoured sir if now i deliver my soul by telling you that i think in this you greatly err
1472007 but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed
1472008 when i saw that god by the wind which was carrying you out brought me in i asked counsel of god his answer you have enclosed
1472009 though god never before gave me a wrong lot yet perhaps he suffered me to have such a lot at that time to try what was in your heart
1472010 nothing but the strongest conviction not only that what is here advanced is the truth as it is in jesus but also that i am indispensably obliged to declare this truth to all the world
1472011 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all i e all saints how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
1472012 it wholly takes away those first motives to follow after it so frequently proposed in scripture the hope of future reward and fear of punishment the hope of heaven and the fear of hell et cetera
1472013 if a sick man knows that he must unavoidably die or unavoidably recover though he knows not which it is not reasonable to take any physic at all
1472014 so directly does this doctrine tend to shut the very gate of holiness in general to hinder unholy men from ever approaching thereto or striving to enter in thereat
1472015 does the doctrine tend to destroy several particular branches of holiness such as meekness love et cetera
1472016 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye
1472017 contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints
1472018 this doctrine tends to destroy the comforts of religion the happiness of christianity et cetera
1472019 the godly consideration of predestination and election in christ is full of sweet pleasant unspeakable comfort to godly persons and such as feel in themselves the working of the spirit of christ mortifying the works of the flesh and their earthly members and drawing their minds to high and heavenly things as well because it does greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation to be enjoyed through christ as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards god
1472020 this is evident as to all those who believe themselves to be reprobate or only suspect or fear it all the great and precious promises are lost to them they afford them no ray of comfort
1472021 even in those who have tasted of that good gift who yet have soon lost it again
1472022 and fallen back into doubts and fears and darkness even horrible darkness that might be felt et cetera
1472023 he was tempted in all things like as we are
1472024 many very many of those that hold it not in all parts of the earth have enjoyed the uninterrupted witness of the spirit the continual light of gods countenance from the moment wherein they first believed for many months or years to this very day
1472025 greatly confirms and establishes a true christians faith of eternal salvation through christ
1472026 who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
1472027 into doubts and fears into horrible darkness even darkness that may be felt
1472028 how uncomfortable a thought is this that thousands and millions of men without any preceding offence or fault of theirs were unchangeably doomed to everlasting burnings
1472029 the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded
1472030 this doctrine has a direct manifest tendency to overthrow the whole christian religion for
1472031 supposing that eternal unchangeable decree one part of mankind must be saved though the christian revelation were not in being
1472032 tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
1472033 the assertors of this doctrine interpret that text of scripture jacob have i loved but esau have i hated as implying that god in a literal sense hated esau and all the reprobates from eternity
1472034 they infer from that text i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy that god is merciful only to some men viz the elect and that he has mercy for those only flatly contrary to which is the whole tenor of the scripture as is that express declaration in particular the lord is loving to every man and his mercy is over all his works
1472035 moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
1472036 the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her rebekah the elder shall serve the younger
1472037 o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor
1472038 even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
1472039 the lord is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
1472040 i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live
1472041 christ not only died for those that are saved but also for those that perish
1472042 and this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent

1472197 but the violent crime energy crisis and just all around feeling of things getting worse made me think again i love my country but i dont see a future there anymore
1472198 many of the issues in this country we have invented that political instability doesnt happen anywhere else in the world that racism doesnt happen anywhere else in the world
1472199 we need to look at these things and put them in context were an emerging market and that should make us exciting we have a wonderful country and we have to fight for it we have to stand up for it
1472200 ive been back for a month now and i find it exhilarating

1472213 barack obama will demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual
1472214 sen john mccain came up with a terrific idea monday july 28 when he was handed an invitation to meet with our editorial board as part of our endorsement process
1472215 why dont you invite senator barack obama to join me mccain suggested
1472216 mccain noted that he has been frustrated in his attempts to have just the two of us stand there and answer questions in a town hall format
1472217 unfortunately he obama has refused to do so mccain told our colleagues debra j saunders and carla marinucci at the start of an interview at san franciscos fairmont hotel
1472218 senator obama consider this an official invitation for a debate with mccain before the chronicles editorial board
1472219 the format would be straightforward and substantive modeled after the five debates we hosted and streamed live on the web with statewide candidates in 2006
1472220 senator mccain gets extra points for proposing a unglossed unscripted groundbreaking version of the presidential debate in the bluest of states and at a newspaper that last endorsed a republican for president in 1992

1472230 csps service and systems integration business reported solid results in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 while the systems business continues to be affected by the shifting of military priorities away from strategic programs
1472231 our year over year comparisons are challenged for the three and nine month periods as we reported a significant amount of systems revenue in fiscal 2007 from a major supply contract with raytheon
1472232 in fiscal 2008 we are recording systems revenue from a number of small multicomputer contracts in contrast to the large contract we were awarded last year in addition contracts that previously had been delayed and were expected to result in revenue in the second half of fiscal 2008 have now been pushed out to fiscal 2009 as a result we now expect that revenues for the second half of fiscal 2008 from our systems business will approximate those from the first half of the year
1472233 during the fourth quarter our systems business will introduce a hybrid computing platform through our previously announced partnership with annapolis micro systems
1472234 the new platform will include annapolis innovative design and development tools on a field programmable gate array fpga integrated chip within our fastcluster rugged computing platform this hybrid fastcluster computing environment is capable of supporting hundreds of hybrid compute blades and includes a broad set of libraries diagnostics and development tools that promote collaboration productivity and portability we are excited to be offering a high quality hybrid computing solution to military and commercial customers
1472235 csps service and systems integration business continued to perform well across each of its subsidiaries in the third quarter
1472236 our german subsidiary is capitalizing on demand for its professional service practices including lifecycle management archiving and network migration and security in the united states our systems and solutions division ssd which provides it infrastructure solutions is leveraging an expanded sales force to generate excellent sales growth we also are pleased with our u k subsidiary which reported another profitable quarter
1472237 as we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2008 we remain cautiously optimistic about the demand environment and the opportunities we are seeing at our service and systems integration business however we are keeping a watchful eye for any changes in the economies of the countries in which we operate we are focused on continuing to grow this business organically as well as through strategic acquisitions that would provide complementary technical or geographic practices

1472243 wir gaben moses f rwahr das buch und lie en gesandte folgen in seinen fu stapfen und jesus dem sohn der maria gaben wir offenkundige zeichen und st rkten ihn mit dem geiste der heiligkeit wollt ihr denn jedesmal da ein bote zu euch kommt mit dem was ihr selbst nicht w nschet hoff rtig sein und einige als l gner behandeln und andere erschlagen
1472244 jene gesandten haben wir erh ht einige ber die andern darunter sind die zu denen allah sprach und einige hat er erh ht um rangstufen und wir gaben jesus dem sohn der maria klare beweise und st rkten ihn mit dem geist der heiligkeit und w re es allahs wille dann h tten die welche nach ihnen kamen nicht miteinander gestritten nachdem ihnen deutliche zeichen zuteil geworden doch sie waren uneins es waren solche unter ihnen die glaubten und solche die ungl ubig waren und w re es allahs wille sie w rden nicht miteinander gestritten haben doch allah f hrt durch was er plant
1472245 wie die engel sprachen o maria allah gibt dir frohe kunde durch ein wort von ihm sein name soll sein der messias jesus sohn marias geehrt in dieser und in jener welt einer der gottnahen
1472246 als jesus dann ihren unglauben wahrnahm sprach er wer will mein helfer sein in allahs sache die j nger antworteten wir sind allahs helfer wir glauben an allah und bezeuge du da wir gehorsam sind
1472247 wie allah sprach o jesus ich will dich eines nat rlichen todes sterben lassen und dich zu mir erheben und dich reinigen von den anw rfen derer die ungl ubig sind und will die die dir folgen ber jene setzen die ungl ubig sind bis zum tage der auferstehung dann ist zu mir eure wiederkehr und ich will richten zwischen euch ber das worin ihr uneins seid
1472248 sprich wir glauben an allah und an das was zu uns herabgesandt worden und was herabgesandt ward zu abraham und ismael und isaak und jakob und den nachfahren und was gegeben ward moses und jesus und anderen propheten von ihrem herrn
1472249 und wegen ihrer rede wir haben den messias jesus den sohn der maria den
1472250 o volk der schrift bertreibt nicht in eurem glauben und saget von allah nichts als die wahrheit der messias jesus sohn der maria war nur ein gesandter allahs und eine frohe botschaft von ihm die er niedersandte zu maria und eine gnade von ihm glaubet also an allah und seine gesandten und saget nicht drei lasset ab ist besser f r euch allah ist nur ein einiger gott fern ist es von seiner heiligkeit da er einen sohn haben sollte sein ist was in den himmeln und was auf erden ist und allah gen gt als besch tzer
1472251 wir lie en jesus den sohn der maria in ihren spuren folgen zur erf llung dessen was schon vor ihm in der thora war und wir gaben ihm du evangelium worin f hrung und licht war zur erf llung dessen was schon vor ihm in der thora war eine f hrung und ermahnung f r die gottesf rchtigen
1472252 die unter den kindern israels die nicht glaubten wurden verflucht durch die zunge davids und jesus des sohnes der maria dies weil sie ungehorsam waren und zu freveln pflegten
1472253 wenn allah sagen wird o jesus sohn der maria gedenke meiner gnade gegen dich und gegen deine mutter wie ich dich st rkte mit der heiligen offenbarung du sprachest zu den menschen sowohl im kindesalter wie auch im mannesalter und wie ich dich die schrift und die weisheit lehrte und die thora und das evangelium und wie du bildetest aus ton wie ein vogel bildet auf mein gehei dann hauchtest du ihm einen neuen geist ein und es wurde ein beschwingtes wesen nach meinem gebot und wie du die blinden heiltest und die auss tzigen auf mein gebot und wie du die toten erwecktest auf mein gehei und wie ich die kinder israels von dir abhielt als du mit deutlichen zeichen zu ihnen kamest die ungl ubigen unter ihnen aber sprachen
1472254 als die j nger sprachen o jesus sohn der maria ist dein herr imstande uns einen tisch mit speise vom himmel herabzusenden
1472255 da sprach jesus sohn der maria o allah unser herr sende uns einen tisch vom himmel herab mit speise da er ein fest f r uns sei f r den ersten von uns und f r den letzten von uns und ein zeichen von dir und gib uns versorgung denn du bist der beste versorger
1472256 und wenn allah sprechen wird o jesus sohn der maria hast du zu den menschen gesprochen
1472257 und wir leiteten zacharias und johannes und jesus und elias alle geh rten sie zu den rechtschaffenen
1472258 so ist jesus sohn der maria eine aussage der wahrheit ber die sie uneins sind
1472259 und gedenke der zeit da wir mit den propheten den bund eingingen und mit dir und mit noah und abraham und moses und mit jesus dem sohn der maria wir gingen mit ihnen einen feierlichen bund ein
1472260 er verordnete f r euch eine glaubenslehre die er noah anbefahl und die wir dir offenbart haben und die wir abraham und moses und jesus auf die seele banden n mlich bleibet standhaft im gehorsam und seid nicht gespalten darin hart ist f r die heiden das wozu du sie aufrufst allah w hlt dazu aus wen er will und leitet dazu den wer sich bekehrt
1472261 wenn jesus mit klaren beweisen kommen wird wird er sprechen traun ich komme zu euch mit der weisheit und um euch etwas von dem zu verdeutlichen wor ber ihr uneinig seid so f rchtet allah und gehorchet mir
1472262 dann lie en wir unsere gesandte ihren spuren folgen und wir lie en jesus den sohn der maria ihnen folgen und wir gaben ihm das evangelium und in die herzen derer die ihm folgten legten wir g te und barmherzigkeit das m nchstum jedoch das sie sich erfanden das schrieben wir ihnen nicht vor um das trachten nach allahs wohlgefallen doch sie befolgten es nicht auf richtige art dennoch gaben wir denen unter ihnen die gl ubig waren ihren lohn aber viele unter ihnen waren ruchlos
1472263 und gedenke der zeit da jesus sohn der maria sprach o ihr kinder israels ich bin allahs gesandter an euch erf ller dessen was von der thora vor mir ist und bringer der frohen botschaft von einem gesandten der nach mir kommen wird
1472264 o die ihr glaubt seid allahs helfer wie jesus sohn der maria zu den j ngern sprach wer sind meine helfer f r allah die j nger sprachen wir sind allahs helfer so glaubte ein teil von den kindern israels w hrend ein teil ungl ubig blieb da verliehen wir denen die glaubten st rke gegen ihren feind und sie wurden siegreich
1472265 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it
1472266 it really is an act of pure heroism that ordinary residents acting on impulse with little regard for their own lives made this rescue attempt

1472279 kui v rrelda iluuisutamisega siis br sselis on suurem koolis idu osa aga siin on suurem roll vabakaval
1472280 ega koolis it pole lihtsam aga vabakavas saab lihtsalt ise rohkem l bu tunda kui sa sellega hakkama saad
1472281 kui eesti poolt on selle m rgiks see kuiv rd palju me venemaad oma uudistes kajastame ja kui emotsionaalselt me teinekord venemaa s ndmustele reageerime siis venemaa puhul on kokkuv tvaks s naks
1472282 tuntakse ennast ebamugavalt v iksema riigi k rval kellega kunagi olid leivad hes kapis aga kes n d elab omaenda ran gemise j rgi ebamugavus toob kaasa v ritim istmist ja usaldamatust ning sealt edasi tulevad k ik muud probleemid
1472283 m ned autorid tlevad et 1918 1995 aastani ma loodan et eesti ja venemaa vahel l heb see palju kiiremini
1472284 aga et see justkui v luvitsa abil le v iks juhtuda poleks realistlik m tlemine
1472285 selle lootuse ma j taks k ll tema vastutusele ega hakkaks kohvipaksu pealt ette vaatama
1472286 aga ma pole ldse p ris kindel et probleem on piirilepingus endas
1472287 probleem on pigem selles mida naaberriigist m eldakse arvatakse v i hoopist kkis kellena teda n ha tahetakse
1472288 see on palju laiema poliitilise konteksti poliitilise kliima ja tahte k simus kui ainult piirileppe k simus

1472290 see kuidas me el is kalap gikvoodid paika saame m jutab meie praktilist elu palju rohkem kui see mis kuup eval t pselt j ustub piirileping venemaaga
1472291 jah emotsionaalses plaanis oleme n vanast armust kummalisel kombel siiani n oga rohkem venemaa poole ja v hem br sseli poole kui praeguses reaalses elus sellele p hjendust leiduks
1472292 on olemas head v ljavaated suhete arendamiseks eesti l ti ja leeduga
1472293 ma arvan et selliseid pabereid kirjutatakse eelk ige praktilise poliitika n teaduslikuks p hjendamiseks
1472294 ja see oleks t epoolest sna praktiline kui el p ab venemaa arengule kaasa aidata siis el ei saa ju seda arengut venemaa eest ra teha nagu mitte keegi teine ei saa noore inimese eest kasvamise rasket t d ra teha
1472295 ks p hjus miks ma heameelega siia tulin on kindlasti see inimese p siv rtus targemaks saada mind huvitab v ga kuidas eestlased venemaal elavad
1472296 kindlasti huvitab mind k ia ra nendes kohtades kuhu eesti saadiku jalg veel astunud ei ole
1472297 ma arvan et see oleks igati t nuv rne kui nnestuks suhteid siin elavate eestlastega tihendada eriti nendega kes ei ela moskvas ja peterburis kus on paremad v imalused eestisse s itmiseks

1472319 m nsime et co2 maksustamise asjus v iks midagi kaaluda ja see v iks olla seotud auto registreerimisega ning olla hekordne maks kui auto soetatakse
1472320 eesti ja leedu on minu teada ainukesed riigid euroopas kus ei kehti automaksu
1472321 kuna eesti autosid siiani ei maksusta siis v iks see maksuliik k ne alla tulla
1472322 k tuseaktsiisi kaudu maksustatakse autoga s itmist see uus maks oleks auto omamise eest
1472323 see oleks osa koloogilisest maksureformist millest t ki v ljarebimisest kiiret ja suurt tulu loota pole
1472324 hekordse ostmisega seotud maksuna hakkaksid inimesed oma autosid registreerima teistes riikides kus niisugust maksu pole
1472325 kui seda summat t sta siis vaid paindlikult ja mitte liiga j rsult sest muidu loobub enamik maksu tasumisest sest kontrollida seda nagunii palju ei j uta

1472380 adewale is a high motor kid has gotten a lot better rushing the passer
1472381 hes a very strong kid in the run game has great explosion great hands we expect him to come in and be a key contributor keep pushing eric moncur and the other guys because we want to get the best four linemen on the field hes doing a great job of that the offensive linemen come up and talk about him but everybodys improving as a group
1472382 we like to keep that rotation heavy so guys stay fresh hopefully around five or six it all depends on who is game ready thats what dictates it ideally you want five but you dont want to throw a guy out there who isnt ready to go
1472383 he has more natural skills right now coming in the door than javon did
1472384 i worked with javon a lot and javon did some good things as a freshman he was a little stiff coach swasey and those guys did a great job in the weight room getting him together marcus robinson has some unbelievable tools great tools so hes got a lot of potential
1472385 getting dwayne hendricks back healthy definitely helps out guys are working hard to get better and theres competition micanor regis has come in and done a lot of things competition makes us all better
1472386 i was amazed at how fast he was able to learn all this stuff
1472387 heres a for instance during the practice session whoever is getting the play i will
1472388 whats the play now you dont have a script but you got somebody calling out the plays and if you dont hear the play and i call on your name then i know your real serious about learning a mental rep to me is as important as a physical rep to me and so xavier i was looking around when he wasnt in the game and someone asked whats the play he rehearsed it to me snaps his finger like that its a maturity factor its the ability to focus and listen when coaches are coaching and thats what some of the younger guys to be honest with you have to learn
1472389 he has to go through the acclimation period so it takes time
1472390 you have to go through two days in helmets the whole day he did some conditioning stuff which is good for him because he cant just come in and play a kid could get hurt that way
1472391 brandon harris is right behind me pushing me so is demarcus van dyke im trying to be somewhat of a mentor to brandon because hes working a lot at the nickel and i kind of look up to bruce hes a great corner were all just working together
1472392 when you have guys only the first time playing last year its kind of hard to get them going
1472393 with a new offense coming in guys never touched the field now these guys are making catches left and right in practice big key catches so were kind of excited
1472394 everythings fine with him hes doing well were just monitoring reddick because guys come off knee injuries you go and practice him every day you wont get much out of him its one day off one day on trying to ease him back into it but hes doing fine
1472395 i think i tried to come back a little early and it wound up setting me back i know how to be safe with it now and really take care of it
1472396 im working the most at right guard but on a given day be ill be at a totally different position
1472397 the trouble with switching positions is getting in the right stances im a natural lefty so the left guard position is easier for me but im starting to get it at right guard what can screw you up is flipping the plays when flip positions but once you do it enough you can figure it out
1472398 but if my role is to play both guards and make sure fig and orlando have enough rest then thats my role but if i have an opportunity to play center im going balls to the wall
1472399 i think i was coming along i think i was doing good at safety
1472400 but i appreciate the switch ill play wherever coach shannon needs me if he wants me at safety cornerback center wherever
1472401 everybody is having fun out there running around playing in this new defense
1472402 ive been with spence and brown from the spring until now theyve progressed into regular guys i think they definitely know it well enough to teach other guys
1472403 i talk to my mom daily because i love her a lot
1472404 but im comfortable here im looking forward to the next four years of my life here
1472405 right now were taking a lot of reps and we need him to come in so he can take some of the reps off our back so we can last throughout the camp and throughout the season
1472406 eric is a big leader on the d line in general we really need eric back if hes not healthy well go without him but we really could use him
1472407 but i also take pride in stopping the run i dont want to only be known as a guy who can only pass rush on third down i want to known as an all down guy
1472408 in some way form or fashion will help us this year
1472409 time management with the new clock change the way it is now they have to run the offense and not panic be calm stay calm get in and out of the huddle set the plays be able to execute the offense dont give us a negative play if we do those things were going to be fine
1472410 you have no past to bring up about your football program

1472415 even with one loss the sec champion is now a virtual lock for one of the two spots in the bcs national championship game
1472416 if they do it will be a very close game
1472417 in some way form or fashion will help us this year

1472423 the mcilwraith range area is well known to be the largest remaining tropical rainforest area in australia and has an extraordinary array of species and land formations which are pretty unique and globally special so its a very special area
1472424 thats an advantage that we had we werent forced to accept terms that we just didnt think were necessarily ones that were the most reasonable and advantageous
1472425 and by taking more time and seeing how the economy now at least here in las vegas has not fallen off the cliff as some people have suggested well be in far better position
1472426 i think this is better timing i think there was too much coming down the pipeline at the same time
1472427 i think its very advantageous for us that none of this is going to all occur at the same time
1472428 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment

1472453 this was the first serious meeting with a high ranking official like the prime minister within the last 15 to 20 years
1472454 but the outcome of the meeting showed the discussion in fact was a formality maybe he will carry out serious reforms in other spheres but not teghut i think
1472455 the pm has started important reforms from his office the work day starts at 9 a m the government sessions are as transparent as possible he demands computer and other kinds of literacy from the ministers organizes regularly scheduled meetings with citizens and actively responds to the questions raised made a call for cooperation to the opposition and participated and spoke at the opposition congress set a compulsory requirement for the ministries to work with non governmental organizations and so on
1472456 as long as we can acquire sufficient liquid assets we will be all right
1472457 this is why we have procured this part of the system first we know how the final system is going to operate and this is not going to be any different from how it will be delivered

1472459 it is the most challenging times i have ever seen
1472460 we dont have enough of some of our cars to sell
1472461 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
1472462 thats why were accelerating production of four cylinder models and quickly responding to market conditions
1472463 it is not difficult to imagine similar scenarios in the it branch or among engineers secretaries or nurses
1472464 in this era of individualization it was a huge mistake to create an organization of that size
1472465 it has become much more difficult to plan for labor battles
1472466 if each group of employees fights only for themselves solidarity plays less of a role and the socially weak are left behind
1472467 until then the entire architectural discipline had the impression of herzog amp de meuron as the skin architects
1472468 in my opinion if they had submitted this kind of design for the competition they would have been denied by the chinese people
1472469 china wanted to have something new for this very important stadium
1472470 we wanted the stadium to be a collective building a public vessel
1472471 but of the kind you would find on a gothic cathedral where structure and ornamentation are the same

1472480 marriage is a sacred institution and its protection is essential to the continued strength of our society marriage protection week provides an opportunity to focus on our efforts on preserving the sanctity of marriage and on building strong and healthy marriage in america marriage is a union between a man and a woman we must support the institution of marriage and help parents build stronger families and we must continue our work to create a compassionate welcoming society where people are treated with dignity and respect
1472481 my guess is that it will stay close i think there is a potential for obama to open up a wide lead i cant imagine mccain opening up a wide lead i can imagine mccain winning but if he wins it is going to be a close race there is some potential for obama to open it up this one has been so unexpected that it is wise to stay out of the prediction business
1472482 in our poll obama has about a five point lead over senator mccain that is much closer than we would have guessed a republican would be running against a democrat six months ago because all of the advantages in this election are with the democrats there is great unhappiness with president bush less than one in five americans are happy with national conditions generally presidential elections are referendums on the times and the republicans represent the status quo and the democrats the change
1472483 we did a 24 nation poll back in april and early may and we were stunned by the level of public interest in the american presidential campaign majorities in many countries said they were paying somewhat close attention to what is going on in japan for example we had 83 percent of japanese respondents saying they were paying either very or fairly close attention that was three points higher than what we were getting in the united states
1472484 more people are thinking about going to the beach or going to the mountains than they are thinking about who they are going to vote for in november so summer polls always have a certain element of not being spot on my own feeling is that lets wait and go through the conventions and see what happens and see how they emerge from the conventions because i think the american people are going to have a better idea about senator obama after the conventions

1472544 frankly many divorcing parents dont handle the situation correctly and sadly act selfishly the innocent bystanders their children suffer the consequences which last long after the divorce
1472545 parents need to be more responsible in how they comport themselves during this tumultuous time from breaking this devastating news to their children to not badmouthing the ex in front of the children to simply allowing the child to love the other parent and shame on christie for making her children go through the public display of their fathers humiliation this may have made her feel vindicated but surely their children will be impacted forever
1472546 although many think divorce is not a big deal anymore because it is so common and socially acceptable the national child development study found otherwise children from disrupted families tend to do less well in school and subsequent careers than their peers they are also more likely to experience the break up of their own partnerships

1472579 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much

1472666 i want to thank joe and leonard for really understanding the potential of this facility
1472667 in 2005 when wyeth announced they would be closing operation at the plant it could have been a devastating blow to the region but the people of rouses point saw it as an opportunity and a call to action with the assistance of garry douglas and the plattsburgh north country chamber of commerce we were able to show akrimax that there was a top notch operation and dedicated workforce waiting in rouses point for the right company to move in i am proud to have had the opportunity to help make this connection and i am glad that our hard work has resulted in a solution that benefits akrimax and the local community it was the people and the quality of the work ethic that made this all possible

1472701 soong churchill prime minister of great britain from 1940 1945 and 1951 1955 said that recently it has been alleged that china has concentrated troops in order to attack tibet i replied that i have never heard of such a message
1472702 and meanwhile i said that tibet is not an independent nation as churchill had claimed all previous agreements between china and britain have recognized that china possesses sovereign rights in tibet and i believe this fact has already been under your careful examination

1472707 im convinced the iranian people wouldve laid down their lives for us
1472708 they would almost immediately invite us home to meet their parents and share a meal
1472709 theres a saying in iran that guests are friends of god they really understand that
1472710 as we practiced our faith and shared with them that opened a lot of doors it meant we had integrity
1472711 they believe that we all worship the god of abraham and they are all protected and have a place in iran
1472712 islam is a great monotheistic faith very moral and ethical with a deep sense of community and respect
1472713 what impressed me was their deep practice of their faith in god
1472714 my personal faith is certainly deeper more joyful more trusting now
1472715 so what does this mean for our ministry we dont know yet
1472716 we could start by loving our muslim brothers and sisters in our own towns that would be a huge step forward for peace and friendship
1472717 even if we disagree we simply have to advocate for each other to live in peace
1472718 father in this period referred primarily to his role as creator and author of all things

1472771 if i were a u s farmer i think my concern would be how much litigation lies ahead
1472772 there are many countries that are gunning for u s agricultural policy
1472773 certainly having weak prices any time in the future is bad news whichever way to look at it
1472774 its not a massive blow to agricultural trade today that the doha agreement did not happen
1472775 our trade has continued to be important and continues to grow
1472776 all of u s agriculture is disappointed that talks failed
1472777 an agreement that offers new market access is the best chance for all of us to achieve any new export growth
1472778 part of the problem with the doha negotiations has been that economic circumstances have been so good that there hasnt been the necessity to make the hard political decisions that are required for a trade agreement
1472779 the air france results really look good and the outlook has been confirmed beyond the results the fall in the price of oil is supporting the whole sector
1472780 we are of course confident of having a positive result from our operations activities this year and even more our net result
1472781 we are just finishing the papers for the request that will be presented almost for sure next week we view positively the reaction of the u s government
1472782 in this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race ba iberia link up that means one less player
1472783 the us federal reserve left the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 0 percent as widely expected by the market
1472784 todays fomc federal open market committee statement was clearly a disappointment for many market players and the recent strength in the us dollar may easily evaporate in a wave of profit taking
1472785 when riding a bike one of the most difficult things to do is to balance while trying to stay still
1472786 in a way that is what the market is trying to do so far this week waiting for the central bank announcements but trying to gauge how best to balance in the meantime
1472787 for now standing still may be enough to ensure that the dollar advances after all most other economies appear to be sliding backwards

1472801 the storys always the same its an unfortunate mistake or someone has let them down

1472808 the mcilwraith range area is well known to be the largest remaining tropical rainforest area in australia and has an extraordinary array of species and land formations which are pretty unique and globally special so its a very special area
1472809 its a very significant issue and theres certainly a need for system support for schools to deal with it

1472811 todays prime time television programming is not merely indifferent to the institution of marriage and the stabilizing role it plays in our society
1472812 it seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
1472813 things that would not have been acceptable five or 10 years ago in our society are considered just part of the ongoing culture today
1472814 broadcast television reflects society and many advertisers are willing to adjust with the societal norms of a particular time

1472818 now about 30 times a summer it comes up over our dock
1472819 each summer the need for coastal restoration is brought home by the threat of hurricanes
1472820 tropical storm edouard is another example of how significant wetlands are to louisianas safety
1472821 wetlands reduce the storm surge from tropical weather providing the protection that citizens have historically relied on
1472822 about the only thing theyll save is whats inside the levees the rest of this is history its getting worse and worse every year

1472827 there cannot be a rule that says if you have a representative on the board you cant make a bid for the company

1472836 yes we have in principle agreed to form a maoist led government based on national consensus and we are exploring it
1472837 international forces including india were out to deny prachanda the natural democratic right to head the government in nepal and koirala was acting as a pawn
1472838 and clearly the process has passed muster as full and fair
1472839 i dont think that anybody could argue that this was a fair trial
1472840 if the police crossed the line then normally everything after that would be considered fruit of the poisoned tree and excluded
1472841 the prosecutor has more control over life liberty and reputation than any other person in america his discretion is tremendous he can have citizens investigated and if he is that kind of person he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations or the prosecutor may choose a more subtle course and simply have a citizens friends interviewed the prosecutor can order arrests present cases to the grand jury in secret session and on the basis of his one sided presentation of the facts can cause the citizen to be indicted and held for trial he may dismiss the case before trial in which case the defense never has a chance to be heard while the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society when he acts from malice or other base motives he is one of the worst
1472842 at the center of the storm my years at the cia
1472843 i have a few tips for future cia directors and for anyone who aspires to participate in government at a similar level first you are never offstage anything you say can be used against you down the road to make someone elses point thats the way washington has evolved there are no private conversations even in the oval office
1472844 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisers in this or in any other context that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
1472845 yes we could do that but it would be wrong
1472846 l iberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people who have a right to knowledge and a desire to know but besides this they have a right an indisputable unalienable indefeasible divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge i mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers
1472847 excessive secrecy has significant consequences for the national interest when as a result policymakers are not fully informed government is not held accountable for its actions and the public cannot engage in informed debate
1472848 on what authority you forget mr president that i no longer work for you so what are you going to do if i dont fire me

1472850 look at the information mr hamdan provided to the united states when it mattered most
1472851 you know what mr hamdan had agreed to do and you know how we squandered that opportunity
1472852 the leader of al qaeda himself hosted a wedding feast for the accused this shows just how close he was to the very top of this terrorist conspiracy

1472856 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1472857 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1472858 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1472859 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1472860 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
1472861 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
1472862 i dont remember anyone talking about knowing they were being videotaped in those meetings but if you have the khadr videotape and this statement that seems pretty clear the question is did the u s destroy everything
1472863 interrogators from recognized human rights abusing regimes onto the u s military base
1472864 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist and that contrary to what the military says it was absolutely sop
1472865 i would be shocked if they had not been destroyed
1472866 i think theres no question if you invite someone in and they threaten them the person who invited them in should be held accountable
1472867 we will request any and all videotapes by u s and foreign intelligence services to find out what was being done to them and what threats were made against them

1472878 they felt it would be helpful if senior officials in government met with candidates who were from outside the province even outside the country in order to sell them on the promotion of the province what a great place it is to live and to work
1472879 i would challenge anyone out there to point to an example of where government has interfered at all with the academic autonomy at memorial
1472880 we have just deliberately not gotten involved we have not interfered in any manner at all

1472987 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1472988 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1472989 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1472990 what if your behavior was legally accepted for dozens of years and all of a sudden it came into question
1472991 this is going to be a fresh look into what really goes on behind the scenes of a film shoot without the candy coating
1472992 we are hoping the series is a hit so if you start watching and get sucked in please tell your friends please tell your friends friends please post comments and please show your support
1472993 you can hear a commentary track with me jieho lee walt lloyd our dp and robert hoffman our editor
1472994 there are some fun outtakes and a few deleted scenes including my fave the check up scene between kevin bacon and julie delpy
1472995 between sam raimi and rob tapert at ghost house the experience of barry and stan at grindstone and lionsgate who is the king of genre marketing and distribution dance of the dead has found the perfect home
1472996 i am thrilled to be working with them both and i know they will do a fantastic job bringing the movie to audiences everywhere
1472997 it will be a major us dvd release through lionsgate and ghost house
1472998 i am just glad we have a release and with a name like sam raimi attached that poses a very bright future indeed i am quite satisfied with this news personally it is encouraging based on who noticed and that it will be released as part of a fall lineup
1472999 i hate you dont touch me or bat and hat
1473000 what is bisexuality is it more prevalent today than in the past or have we just given a new name to something thats been here all along
1473001 this film combines my two favorite genres teens trying to get laid and zombies
1473002 i may be an adult but i know how kids talk
1473003 oh wait a second they are speaking in english why am i reading spanish subtitles
1473004 just as the toronto fest was reaching its close with few big bucks buys first look studios and greenestreet films pacted on the heftiest sale of the event
1473005 first look paid more than 3 million late thursday for u s rights to greenestreets comedy
1473006 as he grew into studio pictures van sant started working with trained screen actors casting professional teens in such youth centric stories as
1473007 then came elephant van sants reaction to the columbine shootings which called for a more neorealist approach the local high school portlanders were all really intense characters van sant recalls the trick was to find the ones that remain themselves in front of the camera
1473008 while its odd and off beat it definitely has heart which i think is nice because its endearing and at the same time its relatable
1473009 its going to be like these napoleon dynamite characters in a real story like in a nice kind of classic timeless story
1473010 documentary filmmaker looking for suicidal individual to follow from first preparation to final act
1473011 i grew up in orlando fl and used to work at the florida film festival which is actually how i met jieho
1473012 the festival headquarters is the enzian theater one of the best independent movie houses in the country they will be showing air starting this friday feb 29th and it will play for one week only i will be introducing the film and doing a q amp a afterwards at the 6 30 screening on friday the 29th and at the 3 30 screening on march 1st come check it out if youre in florida
1473013 thanks to all whove seen the film and have shared their thoughts about it critics were not kind to us but were already seeing the films passionate fans emerging online
1473014 i cant wait until the dvd is out and everyone can see it and judge it for themselves some love it some dont but jieho and i are proud to share this story with everyone if it gets people talking then weve done our job
1473015 what struck me most was how so many of the narrative features depict very regional american stories even the east coast or west coast stories are very specific to a neighborhood or subculture
1473016 i think this is a result of more filmmakers writing what they know
1473017 todd turnbull travis quentin young returns home after a stint in juvie for a horrible crime of violence
1473018 it is an agreement that protects a future in which the internet becomes the primary means of both content creation and delivery
1473019 it creates formulas for revenue based residuals in new media provides access to deals and financial data to help us evaluate and enforce those formulas and establishes the principle that when they get paid we get paid
1473020 i think this years lineup represents our current world of extremes
1473021 the films we found are both funny and emotional both indie and hollywood both entertaining and political both real and magical its a well rounded slate of films from both veteran masters and promising newcomers
1473022 i still am not at liberty to reveal any details of a date or distributor
1473023 i can tell you we now are leaning toward may as a release month it was originally going to be march but that is probably going to change sorry still two more months to wait but i promise it will be worth it
1473024 for those of you outside of the u s i am still looking into dates and countries from our producer
1473025 i know the film has had a limited release in sweden and it is scheduled for a canadian premiere later in the year
1473026 the gains in this contract for directors and their teams are extraordinary and there are no rollbacks of any kind
1473027 this was a very difficult negotiation that required real give and take on both sides
1473028 nonetheless we managed to produce an agreement that enshrines the two fundamental principles we regard as absolutely crucial to any employment and compensation agreement in this digital age first jurisdiction is essential without secure jurisdiction over new media production both derivative and original compensation formulas are meaningless second the internet is not free we must receive fair compensation for the use and reuse of our work on the internet whether it was originally created for other media platforms or expressly for online distribution
1473029 co founded in 2000 by david straus and joe neulight without a box offers an integrated service for indie filmmakers submitting movies online to festivals around the world and promoting them directly to moviegoers
1473030 without a box also provides film festival organizers with tools to manage and promote their events online
1473031 this year at brand dance as we now label the collective swirl of parties gifting suites and sponsor events that run primarily during the first five days of sundance it seems as though there is more happening outside the movie theaters than ever before
1473032 officially sundance attendees will encounter stella artois beer 360 vodka and turning leaf wines at sponsored festival events and see such brand names as entertainment weekly volkswagen ho and adobe all presenting sponsors of the event but visitors wont have to stray far before they run across rebel marketers at motorolas late night lounge the in touch magazine cafe a kenneth cole reaction or fuse lounge or a swag house from hollywood life among numerous others
1473033 we still see a lot of movies out there that were not sure make sense as theatrical titles
1473034 we know that theres an audience for these films as a supplement to our existing day and date program
1473035 european films that find a ready audience in europe and many other parts of the world often seem to struggle in us cinemas
1473036 while we can all speculate on the reason for that the initiative by ifce seems to me to be enterprising and bold we hope to reach the audience that more conventional distributors ignore and widen the choice of films available to cinephiles and the general public alike
1473037 and this years film slate certainly reflects that we re very proud of what sbiff has to offer everyone
1473038 well little miss sunshine this little miss sunshine that come back in a few weeks and well see
1473039 sundance which will celebrate its 30th anniversary this year has always been about making directors feel important but the independent film festival has also in recent years become an increasingly successful marketplace attracting a cornucopia of celebrity and commercial savoir faire
1473040 what used to be an understated showcase for offbeat independent film in a small snowy corner of utah has now turned into a pre oscars bidding jamboree between major film companies there are now nearly 3 000 feature length submissions a year of which around 125 are accepted by the sundance committee to be screened over the course of the 10 day festival
1473041 the biggest challenge for independent films will continue to be a glut of product in the marketplace making it very tough and expensive to break through in a meaningful way
1473042 i think this will force all of us to be very strategic and selective in making acquisition and production decisions making sure we feel the films are unique and marketable enough to warrant the increasing risk
1473043 another issue is that there are too many of them and they are not selective enough partially a function of their being too many of them of course
1473044 going forward we are forced to be more cautious than ever in what we choose to release into the shark tank of theatrical
1473045 films have to almost have a perfect storm marketability good reviews a defined audience and a quiet weekend to release good luck right
1473046 my deepest desire for 2008 is that filmmakers and distributors will begin to understand that the netflix queue or more generally movies at home is not the final resting place for their films but the primary destination
1473047 the battle for precious too few screens has distributors spending more real dollars while the audience is just not going out for our films
1473048 other studios that have decided to go with blu ray include the walt disney co sony corp s sony pictures news corp s twentieth century fox and metro goldwyn mayer
1473049 viacoms paramount pictures which also owns dreamworks skg dropped its support for blu ray and said it would start distributing films exclusively in the hd dvd format universal pictures a unit of general electric also releases films only in hd dvd
1473050 industry grosses totaled 9 62 billion in 2007 or 5 more than a year earlier and 4 more than the industrys previous high from 2002
1473051 ticket sales also were up from 2006 with 1 41 billion admissions marking a 1 year over year uptick and the highest tally since 2004
1473052 on a film set only one person gets to be in charge
1473053 so putting five acclaimed directors in a room together almost guarantees a passionate debate and this eclectic group did not disappoint
1473054 were thrilled to have 21 screen as the opening night film of sxsw 2008
1473055 with a great story as well as fantastic talent in front of and behind the camera were willing to bet that audiences will be just as excited
1473056 reviewing this years best films its tempting to summon up the spirit of the early 70s fondly remembered as a veritable golden age in which a new generation of american filmmakers threw off convention and produced a series of iconoclastic movies
1473057 its around the edges where the system aware that its facing new modes of distribution is experimenting new sources of money and new producers determined to make their marks have shown themselves willing to take chances
1473058 with the passage of decades more and more films are vanishing because of deterioration of the nitrate stock on which older films were shot or to the more recently discovered
1473059 each year hundreds of titles are nominated by the public the librarian makes the final selection after reviewing public input and having extensive discussions with the distinguished members of the national film preservation board as well as the librarys staff
1473060 the informal spirit ceremony could upstage the 80th annual academy awards scheduled for the following day if the strike is not resolved by late february
1473061 the wga has signaled that it does not plan to grant a similar waiver to allow the oscar show to use wga writers which means that some stars could feel free to attend the spirit awards but might then bypass the oscars
1473062 voted on by the 80 some odd members of the hfpa the globes gained significance as an academy awards bellwether with oscars best picture winner for 1992 2003 having also been feted at the globes 11 out of 12 times
1473063 however in recent years its role as a predictor has waned
1473064 the bfca broadcast film critics association touts itself as the largest critics org with 200 tv radio and online critics says
1473065 the group also claims it has been the most accurate oscar bellwether of any awards show with its winners going on to oscar wins some 90 of the time
1473066 i am completely disinterested in you and im bored just standing here
1473067 competition among film fests has always been sharp but its become cutthroat as fests proliferate with literally thousands of them vying for world premieres stars and crucially sponsors
1473068 at a time when studios specialty divisions are jumping onboard projects earlier in the process this years indie awards season front runners offer proof there are just as many worthy films theyve let fall through their fingers
1473069 since the beginning we recognized short films as a viable art form and an exciting way to discover and launch new talent
1473070 we will continue to find innovative ways to extend the success and reach of this amazing work and build a world wide audience for short form films
1473071 2007 was an extremely exciting and challenging year for the nbr in determining the winners in the various categories
1473072 we screened 282 films and the diversity of these narratives is reflected in our 2007 ten best films
1473073 it is impossible to describe in one word the full tapestry of films presented in this years festival particularly in the out of competition categories
1473074 in an enormously eclectic way these films reflect the role cinema can play as an international language transcending borders of class race culture and religion
1473075 in many ways in bruges is a quintessential sundance film its brutal philosophical funny and totally original
1473076 martin mcdonagh is a masterful storyteller a tremendously gifted playwright and provocative risk taker and we are thrilled to showcase his feature length directorial debut
1473077 pushing studios to grab promising material thats ready to go
1473078 some even speculate that the demand could be a boon to the foreign film market as buyers look for inexpensive movies of quality
1473079 what are the criteria used to decide whether an independent film will get picked up for a theatrical release if they arent are most at least released straight to dvd after spending money and time to film them they dont just shelve them do they
1473080 youre an indie guy this aint your kind of movie ive actually heard those exact words from friends
1473081 entertainment attorney andrew hurwitz for example says several of the major pre strike studio projects could collapse because their scripts written by wga members are not as polished as they need to be
1473082 i dont read any reviews from critics or viewers i just go and form my opinion completely void of the thoughts of others
1473083 at a time when the film industry faces full force digital change several hollywood players emerge as harbingers while others relish their secure footing in established traditions
1473084 in our 18th annual power list premiere presents 50 of films most influential actors directors producers studio execs and agents
1473085 do you have the script for fill in the blank
1473086 2007 was an incredibly strong year for independent film ranging from the small gems produced on micro budgets to extraordinary films from specialty divisions the nominees all share the type of creative vision and risk taking that are a hallmark of independent film
1473087 it doesnt have much in the way of content just yet but i just sent off a group of web videos that should be on there shortly
1473088 please join the mailing list to find out when it will be playing in your area
1473089 since 1982 there have been 20 weekends where six or more movies debuted in and or expanded to wide release
1473090 seven is the highest number of nationwide debuts in a single weekend thats happened twice before since 1982 dec 16 18 1983 and dec 22 25 1995 the christmas season is more prone to gluts of new releases than other times of the year
1473091 a straw poll of the times office has revealed the cinema frighteners that still haunt us and thirteen of the most distressing are listed below

1473287 the target clientele was high income so we figured luxury would be the best message to get their attention the first year we spent 175 000 to advertise in nearby states but turns out few of our passengers ever saw or heard those ads
1473288 we emphasized a different message how much time our service saved visitors to the vineyard without us travelers from new jersey new york and connecticut had to make the unpredictable drive to cape cod and take the slow ferry from there were 30 minutes from the connecticut border they could go with us avoid traffic and get there two to four hours faster we focused the campaign on vineyard residents it worked by 2006 i was able to pay back investors and give them a 25 return
1473289 let us see what facilities we need and how much land is needed for the yatra period
1473290 will continue to strive for the earliest possible implementation of the policy referred to in paragraph 4 a
1473291 the u s understands that india will not sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty this was the basis of the negotiations with which we had gone forward and that was addressed throughout the negotiations he told journalists here over phone from washington on tuesday
1473292 unconditional is not a very good word in this context there is a huge amount of work on this understanding and therefore to use the word unconditional to me is oversimplification i will be hoping only for a clean exemption that is my personal view and not of the u s government
1473293 the u s congress is a sovereign body and it has its own procedure and rules so at this point nobody really knows whether it will be able to act in the very short period of time at its disposal what we are trying is to position the 123 agreement in congress the goal is to complete the nsg process in august and submit it in early september
1473294 the notice period can be changed but it is not possible to speak on behalf of congress
1473295 we want to underline that we have already shared the draft with india we want to get the right sort of draft that will be most effective with the nsg in the coming days we will complete the work and distribute it to nsg members
1473296 people to listen seriously and hope at the end of the day they will accept we would not wish to see the additional points raised so that they become part of the process this is a very complex process and we are now moving to the final stage and obviously we hope that all players come together at the nsg and accept that the aim of this to normalise civilian nuclear process with india
1473297 this is an important financial milestone in my campaign for the us senate
1473298 it demonstrates the viability of my candidacy and my ability to compete in the general election
1473299 as a result all the special interests have contributed to his campaign including over 300 000 from the oil and gas industry
1473300 i will not be able to match roberts dollar for dollar but all the money in the world wont help pat hide his abysmal voting record
1473301 its about democrats republicans and independents alike all looking to put partisanship aside to confront the challenges that are most important to all of us our campaign has always been powered by the grassroots support of people seeking a new voice in washington
1473302 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1473303 i think the market realizes that this kind of pressure may in fact lead to a change in policy
1473304 britney spears might buy that but i dont think paris hilton would
1473305 the gop energy policy has led to higher gas and oil prices and republicans just keep voting for more of the same
1473306 a sensitivity analysis on the financial profile of selected financial services firms and assessment of appropriate capital structures

1473312 during the next hearing production of materials in the case as evidence will take place
1473313 we want to do the work causing least inconvenience to the people
1473314 we have achieved a milestone in completing the bidding successfully we have to now plan for lot of issues likely to come up
1473315 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
1473316 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
1473317 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
1473318 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
1473319 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
1473320 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
1473321 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
1473322 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters could look very bad
1473323 not to recommend any institution for conferment of deemed university status
1473324 the state government does not recommend the case of christ college autonomous for conferment of deemed university status
1473325 the university does not have any objection in the enrolment of students already enrolled and approved by the university as it is essential to safeguard the interest and career of students
1473326 the registrar has worded his letters carefully and forwarded them to the ugc without informing anybody
1473327 a complete violation of the governments and the universitys decisions
1473328 somebody is trying to malign the university all the procedures have been followed christ college is a renowned institution which has been granted deemed university status on its own merit however the issue of payment of fees and admission approval is pending before the high court our only concern is students
1473329 there were bundles of 100 notes of rs 50 rs 100 rs 500 and rs 1 000 denomination
1473330 the bigger an issue the economy is for voters the better barack obama is going to do
1473331 if north carolina voters choose on immigration or moral and family values john mccain is going to win a big victory here but if voters increasingly put the economy foremost when deciding who to vote for democrats are going to have the best shot theyve had in quite a long time
1473332 as we prepare to face off with whomever the democrats select as their nominee that we all follow johns lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues throughout the primary election we saw john mccain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics and this will not change
1473333 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
1473334 or as some might say oops he did it again our dependence on foreign oil is one of the greatest challenges we face in this election the american people have a real choice between obamas plan to provide tax rebates to american families while creating a renewable energy economy in america that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil and senator mccains plan to continue the same failed energy policies by handing out nearly 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies while investing almost nothing in the new energy sources that represent our future
1473335 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here

1473344 oh my christmas and charlie sheen is the highest paid comedy
1473345 the scheme is believed to constitute the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the department of justice
1473346 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1473347 what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him
1473348 we need somebody to put rat poisoning in justice stevens creme brulee
1473349 i tell people dont kill all the liberals leave enough so we can have two on every campus living fossils so we will never forget what these people stood for
1473350 doesnt have to look good just throw the sheet over it
1473351 we all know it is a democratic year but that does not mean obama will win yes the odds are in his favor but there are at least 3 reasons why the election may be close with either mccain or obama winning
1473352 we live in a post 9 11 world and the public has to be comfortable with a candidates ability to deal with foreign policy many voters are not yet comfortable second mccain is a good candidate third the last two presidential elections have been very close yes there have been democratic gains in some quarters and turnout may be up but turnout was up in 2004 from 2000 and republicans had made gains right after 9 11 and yet the election remained close
1473353 this is where i see obama as the likely victor not only in the popular vote but in winning perhaps by very close margins in the past blue states he needs to hold on to and in ohio and states in the west and possibly a few surprises this will happen if as i expect obama outcampaigns mccain
1473354 that obama will win but just by a hair the reason the contest will be so close is because of what we call ballot box racism we estimate that about 11 or 12 percent of voters who would otherwise vote for obama will not vote for him because he is black our forecasting model if uncorrected for the race factor predicts a landslide for obama but once the racial cost is corrected for we get a bare obama majority about 50 6 of the two party popular vote
1473355 there will be a hearing when he comes back from the recently completed u s tour but it was totally ok for him to go on tour and things in the papers have been so exaggerated i feel really sorry for him its really unfair to him whats been said in the papers and on the internet im pretty convinced you know nothing will come out of this he will be totally freed and we can go on and record the album and continue with candlemass i dont see a problem there if there was a problem he wouldnt be allowed to go on tour he wouldnt be allowed to go abroad thats how it is you know
1473356 i am not a criminal but sure just like ive sold some cds ive helped
1473357 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1473358 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1473359 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1473360 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1473361 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders

1473363 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
1473364 working with our colleagues at the universit de montr al we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
1473365 we believe that this improvement may represent a significant step forward
1473366 the fact that we can stimulate a specific long term immune response gives us great hope that with additional development we will be able to give people infected with hiv a new option to battle the virus
1473367 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1473368 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1473369 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things
1473370 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1473371 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1473372 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1473373 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1473374 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1473375 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1473376 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1473377 the purpose of this feasibility study was to provide initial proof of concept data and insights
1473378 the overall results are very encouraging and indicate a favorable outcome with many types of tags and readers this project has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of rfid for specific applications and has the potential to satisfy many common use cases especially inventory management

1473381 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1473382 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1473383 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1473384 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1473385 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
1473386 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
1473387 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
1473388 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
1473389 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
1473390 we set up a telephone connection between us and the guys at sri
1473391 we typed the l and we asked on the phone do you see the l yes we see the l came the response we typed the o and we asked do you see the o yes we see the o then we typed the g and the system crashed
1473392 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1473393 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1473394 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1473395 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1473396 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1473397 an attempt to distract from his record of supporting george bush

1473400 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1473401 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1473402 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1473403 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1473404 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1473405 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1473406 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1473407 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1473408 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties
1473409 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1473410 without a floor mat and events like discus or pole vault each have their own control schemes
1473411 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1473412 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1473413 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1473414 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1473415 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1473416 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1473417 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick

1473428 the mice that were inactive put wood shavings in their treadmills and made them beds or actually used them as potties which tells you what they think of exercise

1473431 dont use an excuse saying oh its my genes that made me do it
1473432 the thinking is this probably triggers serotonin and dopamine in the brain which are mood elevators or mood determinants
1473433 remember people who are clinically depressed tend to be very inactive people who arent clinically depressed tend to be more active and when you are active you actually do elevate your mood and you do actually change the level of serotonin and dopamine in your brain so its clear that the brain system and a sense of activity and energy are linked
1473434 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1473435 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1473436 im not the new big anything ive been around for ages and ive been doing all this stuff behind the scenes and i want to put it in the spotlight a bit
1473437 im just having experiences and the songs are just spitting out because the experiences are there

1473439 paul banwart represents the best in scouting and the american legion is proud to have selected him as its eagle scout of the year
1473440 its a standard you have to live up to the merit badges show you have worked to achieve that honor and now you have to work the rest of your life to keep up the standard
1473441 hes above and beyond anything you could ever imagine an exceptional young man
1473442 by constructing boxes to be used in bat habitats banwarts project can assist in defeating serious health problems such as meningitis and west nile
1473443 you learn the limitations of the human body and what it can do
1473444 you can challenge yourself mentally academically but theres also physical tests of strength thats all about developing yourself

1473449 i saw houses collapsing around my house then the rain started pouring down through the roof which by that time was heavily damaged
1473450 the children cough all the time because it is so damp
1473451 i would like to have somewhere better more solid for my family to stay but in order to build a proper house wed need at least 300 000 kyat 46 580 and i dont think well ever have the money
1473452 about a month ago the government came here and demanded that all the refugees go back to where they were from and they are now living in the temporary shelters that theyve built from bamboos and pieces of wood
1473453 kind people have been donating instant noodles and dry foodstuffs which we transfer to the refugees
1473454 they provided the spark but we were the energy that was already out there
1473455 given the increased volatility in the financial services market our clients are placing an increasingly high priority on understanding and managing risk across their portfolios
1473456 this is the best result that weve generated in more than four years and it includes solid growth in both surgeries and paying admissions
1473457 i believe by commenting on the perceived potential subtle racial messaging in the ad you have taken what political scientists refer to as the bait
1473458 and when you have taken the bait the media goes fishing
1473459 now that its been raised its hard to put the genie back in the bottle
1473460 ive had chainsaws weed eaters trimmers pole trimmers even in the mowers its affected the mowers
1473461 it was always carburetor issues it was never nothing else
1473462 90 of what we do on trimmers and chain saws has been fuel related
1473463 probably about 60 70 of what we do on mowers is fuel related now
1473464 im devastated by what hes been through and some of the things ive heard ive not sat down with quinton to this day to discuss things i pray for his well being and if i helped quinton out a little bit with his growth in the sport then ive been very blessed and honored to do that i love this kid with all my heart and i wish him nothing but the best im not going to get in to storytelling its not what im about i havent sat down with quinton jackson and im not going to hear things through sources and through people this is a kid ive been with for almost four years i have nothing but love and support for him all i want for quinton right now is whats best for him whatever he needs from me in any way im here for him and always have been
1473465 we are confident that we can try cases to the highest standards of justice
1473466 i assume the notion was lets see if we can get this engine to turn over
1473467 i find it difficult to consider this as much of a landmark
1473468 to close guantanamo try those accused of terrorist acts in a fair process release or resettle the others and finally put an end to this black spot on americas reputation
1473469 i dont think you want to bring khalid sheikh mohammed and ramzi binalshibh into the federal court system right now
1473470 here in l a its a badge of honor to have been at their show at the roxy

1473472 zionists express interest in the subject of the internet in iran
1473473 the internet in iran and its various facets was the subject of a conference that took place at tel aviv university in occupied palestine
1473474 the conference participants discussed the role of the internet in contemporary society and internet struggles iranian blogs rap music and the role of the internet in creating other types of music that imitate western culture were amongst the subjects that interested the zionists
1473475 the iranian regimes attempts to suppress the blogosphere have largely failed
1473476 you probably know that the term israel does not exist in the official language of the regime of iran
1473477 the average iranian blogger is very anxious about being known as a person who has connections with israeli guys a very interesting example happened a short while ago and i believe it describes the whole situation
1473478 and a very helpful plugin for this system is called firestats and is designed by an israeli blogger
1473479 firestats is developed in givatayim so if we destroy gush dan greater tel aviv there wont be any more versions
1473480 i wrote a piece titled iran israel peace through a wordpress plugin
1473481 because of the sensitivity of the issue i sent an email to my friend asking for his permission before i would publish the post
1473482 when iranian bloggers have to censor themselves when it comes to sharing the mutual passion for scripts and other nerdy stuff with israeli fellows i guess showing any attention to the israeli interest in the iranian blogosphere is out of context
1473483 when you are drowning it does not matter if its one meter or 100 meters
1473484 a friend of mine who came from iran a few days ago was telling me that it is quite common to see iranians criticize the regime even using offensive words in the public transit
1473485 a big portion of the iranians have been exposed to the propaganda of the regime for decades and thus have unintentionally become ambassadors of the islamic entity in many aspects there is a big difference between an iranian who is living inside iran and the one who has had the experience of living in a free society such as canada
1473486 start to question what they have been fed by the regime for a long time and start to think independently
1473487 blogs written by iranian students abroad play a major role for these new born iranians
1473488 fortunately this trend of free thinking is not limited to the iranians who live outside the motherland there is a huge number of blogs written by iranians who live inside iran and these blogs substantially question the official opinions of the regime interestingly the questioning covers issues ranging from the official narration of islam to human rights and sex
1473489 very strong links have been formed between the iranian and the israeli blogospheres the strongest one which i am aware of is our communications with lisa goldman and her blog on the face from time to time i translate her posts to persian and the statistics of my blog which i too get from firestats shows that a lot of my visitors follow her posts passionately there are of course other israeli bloggers whose blogs the iranian bloggers follow but lisa has become almost an icon for many iranian bloggers i have talked to
1473490 the israeli blogosphere in english is a window into israeli society for iranians
1473491 that is why i often translate items from israeli blogs in hebrew in order to expose a different view because the most interesting things written about israel are written only in hebrew
1473492 i do receive emails from iranians it is as if they want us to know that they are not all as they are made to seem in the media and ive had some fascinating encounters there was someone in tehran who used to chat with me via messenger he was a really intelligent knowledgeable guy who knew excellent english we used to chat about the situation in iran the elections democracy and israel about which he was remarkably well informed he even spoke a little hebrew but he refused to tell me his real name and he was pretty paranoid each time he logged on he was at a different computer and using a different online identity i felt as though i were receiving messages from the resistance it was an amazing experience but one day he disappeared and i havent heard from him since
1473493 look i try to show a more human complex and nuanced picture of israeli life theyre sort of stuck behind the middle eastern version of the iron curtain but theyre very curious about us they want to find out more and its as if theyre extending their hands out through the iron curtain the fact that i dont write only about politics but also about my day to day life in tel aviv shows them a lively modern levantine city that they would never see in the mainstream media
1473494 the internet facilitates connections between individuals and bridges between cultures once you neutralize the political landmine it is possible with the help of the internet to create wonderful interpersonal relationships between human beings and to see that both your sorrows and your joys are very similar
1473495 we must find a way to get past the pre conceived notions and one dimensional portraits presented by the mainstream media
1473496 they just perpetuate conflicts i think that if you hear a human voice from the other side thats the beginning of the way
1473497 i am not a sociologist neither am i a philosopher however i do know that when people talk they find less reasons to kill each other
1473498 and this is what blogging is so generously providing us with
1473499 are the deepening connections between the israeli and iranian blogospheres the way to peace

1473505 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1473558 i loved lsu but i needed to get out of my comfort zone i came here to swim with sean hutchinson and he changed my world with swimming
1473559 i think the best way to describe heathers development is her ability to realize her athletic breakthroughs at different stages of her career which gave her confidence to move forward to the next level of her swimming

1473568 one of the best ways to improve is by lining up against the likes of north carolina duke texas and texas a amp m and we were fortunate enough to have that opportunity this spring
1473569 our players have also had an outstanding offseason in our strength and conditioning program were looking for that dedication to continue as we prepare for what is sure to be another exciting season for lsu soccer its hard to believe it all starts in less than three weeks

1473599 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water
1473600 not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1473601 its a very effective agent for soaking up water like a silica gel packet
1473602 when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze
1473603 there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant
1473604 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1473605 there were reports over the weekend that indicated that nasa had a major discovery that nasa was withholding from the public todays teleconference is going to set the record straight
1473606 we have substantial evidence that our soil samples has perchlorates
1473607 they are highly stable and do not destroy life under normal conditions in fact there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1473608 we dont know what mixture of perchlorate salts we have in our solution sodium perchlorate ammonium perchlorate magnesium perchlorate lets take magnesium perchlorate its a very effective agent for soaking up water like silica gel packet when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze weve only begun to think about what this might mean but they could keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long time
1473609 its a stable molecule and it doesnt preclude life on earth in fact it could be an energy source
1473610 there were some initial reports in the the scientific literature that the atacama was very mars like they couldnt find organics or culture microbes but as research continued we found organics and then when we looked closer we found microbes so it turned around microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions and the story could be the same for mars we dont know for sure
1473611 the other probes had different focuses than the meca wet chem which is looking for soluble salt and perchlorate is a very soluble salt
1473612 because perchlorates are chemically inert they move through the soil very quickly in the presence of water this ties back to mars perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1473613 nasa is investigating whether the substance could have gotten there by contamination before launch
1473614 even the scientists admitted to having to hit the textbooks on how it works perhaps the most intriguing suggestion was that magnesium perchlorate can act as a sort of anti freeze in the presence of water
1473615 plus think of all education applications for a 12 computer
1473616 the police are blamed for many things but those police officials did not hit the street children
1473617 i raced outside and across to the hillock opposite the museum and saw three metro police officials lashing out at the children with sjamboks
1473618 the three police officials were extremely menacing and threatened me with imprisonment
1473619 when banks issue merchants credit card accounts they may have to get a tin initially but they dont keep it which is a sound privacy practice
1473620 only collect the data you need and only keep the data as long as you need it
1473621 weve seen this constant stream of data breaches where various kinds of businesses and institutions suffer some kind of data intrusion or lost files the social security number in particular is found to be the most important piece of information for an identity thief
1473622 goes contrary to the whole effort to limit relying on it
1473623 our top priority is the safety and security of our customers
1473624 work closely with our merchants and figure out a way to make reporting the necessary data pretty seamless
1473625 originally legislation was looking like it was going to be targeted at casual sellers
1473626 the aggregate amount of sales reported to the irs isnt going to match the individual sellers tax returns
1473627 once we establish this precedent there could be other governmental purposes where it could be appealing to try and force private intermediaries to track their customers behavior
1473628 reflects that borrowers loans are significantly more expensive if they go through a broker in the subprime market than if they had gone directly to a lender
1473629 it is not going to stop borrowers from being duped into signing onto a loan or loans that they dont understand
1473630 these practices will continue in substantially the same volume regardless of whether the fbi has fingerprints
1473631 identity theft involving fingerprints is becoming a major concern among data security professionals
1473632 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
1473633 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever prosecuted in this country
1473634 there will be no more meetings until the new government is formed

1473643 as long as we can acquire sufficient liquid assets we will be all right
1473644 we cant damage nature because itll cost our state and the people much more to repay
1473645 and clearly we need to take that into account from the very beginning and make balanced decisions we need not be seduced by industrys statistics alone but realize the importance of providing a proper living environment for people
1473646 this was the first serious meeting with a high ranking official like the prime minister within the last 15 to 20 years
1473647 but the outcome of the meeting showed the discussion in fact was a formality maybe he will carry out serious reforms in other spheres but not teghut i think
1473648 the pm has started important reforms from his office the work day starts at 9 a m the government sessions are as transparent as possible he demands computer and other kinds of literacy from the ministers organizes regularly scheduled meetings with citizens and actively responds to the questions raised made a call for cooperation to the opposition and participated and spoke at the opposition congress set a compulsory requirement for the ministries to work with non governmental organizations and so on
1473649 were telling our employees that using videoconferencing is beneficial not just for the environment but also for life balance
1473650 top management who fly a lot recognize that spending your life in airports can be really horrible

1473652 it is not difficult to imagine similar scenarios in the it branch or among engineers secretaries or nurses
1473653 in this era of individualization it was a huge mistake to create an organization of that size
1473654 it has become much more difficult to plan for labor battles
1473655 if each group of employees fights only for themselves solidarity plays less of a role and the socially weak are left behind

1473673 peterson walked into the arlington sandwich shop about 7 45 p m thursday and ordered two subs a spicy italian with everything and a chicken breast when he discovered the spicy italian didnt have sauce he demanded that it be corrected according to a police report
1473674 reginald peterson 42 told officers he called the emergency number so he could have his subs made correctly according to a police report a few minutes later he dialed 911 again to complain the police werent arriving fast enough
1473675 employees told police the burly construction worker became belligerent while a sandwichmaker was working on his order then went outside to call 911

1473756 im going to predict to you right now that obama is not going to get a bump from his convention and ill tell you why its because i think that the left has overdone it for too long on calling people racist i hope that they continue to say every ad mccain runs is racist i hope they keep this up because the american people are sick and tired of it the american people dont believe this country is racist

1473788 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

1473819 one source says he believes madeleine was taken between 9 05pm and 9 15pm and that the patio windows at the rear of the apartment had been shut but unlocked on the night so the mccanns could check on their children more easily

1473894 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1473895 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1473896 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1473897 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1473898 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1473899 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1473900 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1473901 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1473902 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1473906 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1473907 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1473908 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated

1474016 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
1474017 it was something ive been looking forward to for a long time its just good to get back out there and compete i went out there with the mind set that i would go as hard as i could for as long as i could
1474018 s kan du nog st lla dig vid den kontrollen i skogen och h lla fram micken d m ste nog orienterarna prata med dig ven om det r mitt under brinnande t vling
1474019 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1474020 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1474021 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1474022 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1474023 the packers will release you over ted thompsons dead body theyre not going to give you the chance to run through the tunnel opening night as a viking
1474024 i guarantee you that my contract will be like no other
1474025 it will be a ground breaking record contract for sure without a doubt theres so much money to be made right now in mixed martial arts and its all about the fighters trying to make that money its going to be a long term deal where i put my heart and soul into the company and help build them thats something im interested in doing theyre going to bring me on not just as a fighter but also doing some of the back work also
1474026 hes already been talking smack saying if he sees me hes going to kick my ass but right on if he keeps thinking that hell get his face caved in sooner or later i know frank shamrock is another person whos been opening up his mouth he beat me the last time we fought and i think that would be a great revenge fight where i kick his ass and finally shut him up as time goes well see who affliction signs besides me i dont know i might even go up to heavyweight if the bigger pay days are there
1474027 mr trump works fast and gets busy in a lot of the things he does and hes going to give me the best deal possible
1474028 i know they want to make some money and i know they got over 100 000 pay per view buys on their first show and with me its guaranteed to be over 500 000 pay per view buys just by the number of fans that are going to follow me no matter where i go so theyre going to get there moneys worth just in pay per view no matter what
1474029 he not only was a nice guy and very different from the way he is in the ring he was really talented really smart and yes i think he likes me a lot and i like him a lot that doesnt mean he signed a contract with affliction but i think tito would love to deal with us
1474030 they have the right to match the offer so ill be getting a deal that no other fighter has ever gotten its going to be some ground breaking news for sure
1474031 im going to a company thats going to take care of me a company thats going to respect me a company thats going to put me in the forefront and make me the ambassador that ive always been i think mr trump respects me at that value to get it my hearts not with the ufc anymore because of how bad they treated me they dont respect me and they dont see me as a businessman all they think is that im a punk fighter thats going to fold and ive already proven that im not going to fold to anything by not resigning with them
1474032 we talked a little bit about trump getting involved in mma when i was on the show
1474033 i know he did a couple things with wwe and a few boxing events and after the show he said one day i may be interested in getting into your business and i want to sign you and thats pretty much where it was until he signed with affliction and once he signed with affliction i got a personal call from him saying he was going to come to my last fight in the ufc and support me and after my fight was over he walked up to me and said tito you may have lost tonight but you won in my eyes no matter what i just signed with affliction and we want to sign you next he sees the power that i have and hes going to respect me for it
1474034 dont worry dad a family of dorks will come along any minute
1474035 i like crocs theyre so comfortable ill tell you who the dork is the guy writing this story thats who and who died and made him the fashion authority anyway
1474036 was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no
1474037 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
1474038 ive given fashion the finger and joined the dorcs revolution
1474039 which were once so popular that the company couldnt keep pace with demand are now piling up in warehouses
1474040 today crocs shoes are available all over the world and on the internet
1474041 today ill leave the house wearing these neon green dutch bubble shoes with swiss cheese holes in them maybe ill even buy some little plastic strawberries or bananas and jam them in the sweat holes just to jazz things up and make the bacteria incubate faster
1474042 we need to do everything in our power to provide the support that our officers need to track down these killers
1474043 let me just say on behalf of all of the residents of the city of los angeles how mortified we are how horrified we are at this homicide a good man a man who put his life on the line a family man a young man who grew up in a neighborhood very close to where ive lived for a long time
1474044 were still making aggressive attempts to reach out to the community anybody who is a witness to it heard something or has heard somebody talking about it bragging about it were pursuing a number of avenues
1474045 theres something about this mountain that draws us all to it
1474046 i headed down to gilkey memorial to put up the plates we had made to memorialize hugues karim gerard and baig
1474047 it was ironic as the last time i had gone was with a happy healthy hugues i am however happy that he in the end achieved his goal
1474048 this was his third year in a row on k2 and finally he had made the summit and lived his dream
1474049 it is a shame that triumph and tragedy seem to come hand in hand on k2
1474050 base camp now seems like a cage that everyone wants to escape
1474051 the koreans are hiring a few helicopters to take them out rather than walking the americans dutch serbian and norwegians are all waiting for porters to arrive so they can head down very few people are considering staying and trying again
1474052 every evening we hear cascades of rocks falling down the slopes around us
1474053 huge pieces of ice are crashing down in the icefall and avalanches roar down the slopes of all the peaks around us daily rivers flow down where once consolidated snow was it almost seems as though the mountain is weeping for the recently deceased
1474054 its always been a dream of mine to be up there
1474055 and its quite painful to have gotten so close to the summit and turn around
1474056 maybe not next year maybe not the year after that
1474057 but i can say in my lifetime i will for sure come back here theres something about risking your life for something you love and testing your body to its maximum that you cant do in a completely safe environment without risk we arent living
1474058 i used to tell him id never help him climb that mountain
1474059 but i supported him in going to broad peak thats how he got me im just very grateful hes okay

1474114 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1474115 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you

1474121 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1474122 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1474123 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1474124 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you

1474217 i always thought it was funny that actors making war movies would go to these fake boot camps and talk about this incredible experience and how the two weeks really changed their lives says stiller 42
1474218 tropic thunder when a group of self serious actors journey to the jungle to make a vietnam war movie get marooned and run into actual bad guys
1474219 the fatties in which he plays every member of a flatulent obese family
1474220 the joke is an actor who takes himself so seriously that he ridiculously thinks he can immerse himself in this role stiller says
1474221 there were very few actors i thought could do it any sane person would have reservations
1474222 its a part that does have the potential to be some kind of career ender its so out there but ben got the tone right i think people are going to love this guy

1474227 this is probably the one chance ill ever have to work on this scale says stiller who made the movie on kauai
1474228 yeah its a comedy were sending up actors self importance
1474229 but it looks like a war movie after all these years i finally got to make one well kind of

1474232 you can look at how dick cheney did his energy policy he met with oil and gas companies forty times and thats how they put together our energy policy
1474233 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1474234 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1474235 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1474236 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve
1474237 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there there is not a head fake among them
1474238 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1474239 its beginning to look like obama is willing to negotiate away whatever beliefs he may have while we know from bitter experience that mccain is an uncompromising pain in the rear
1474240 he seemed to me more a like a guy who was going to finally get some rest over the weekend rather than someone gearing up for a major rollout the next week
1474241 i could be completely wrong but everyone seemed a little loose for a vp announcement larry grisolano told me he was going away for the weekend on the other hand david perked up when i told him that indiana had the highest jump in unemployment in the month of june so anything is possible i guess
1474242 doesnt look like all those other presidents on dollar bills
1474243 when obama says hell only tax the rich hes saying he will only tax the engine room not the rest of the ship
1474244 at a gut level americans trust mccain even if we do not always agree with him
1474245 im absolutely confident there will be no announcement tomorrow i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement tomorrow id be as surprised as anybody else
1474246 to summarize the obama agenda government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
1474247 with an agenda like that a knack for rhetoric comes in mighty handy but good speeches arent everything in politics good judgment matters too and thats what america is going to need from the next commander in chief
1474248 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1474249 this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it
1474250 two points one they know they are lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474251 they need to do their homework because this is serious business
1474252 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1474253 i saw that senator obamas latest attack is has got to do with oil and campaign contributions
1474254 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it
1474255 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves
1474256 you folks have a nice easter yesterday in new york city was the annual central park easter egg hunt amazing 1 500 eggs they found 1 500 eggs and three dead guys yesterday in new york everybody was in the easter spirit as a matter of fact former governor eliot spitzer he was in the easter spirit he spent the day with someone named bunny did you hear about this two state department employees were fired this is a bit of a scandal because they were looking at barack obamas passport file not only that but the same person was also looking at john mccains civil war records listen to this ladies and gentlemen youre not going to believe this there is a new super toilet on the market being described as high tech low flush senator larry craig just drove one off the lot he said by god ill take that little number senator larry craig from idaho he did not sign up for re election he is not going to run for office again so dont let the stall door hit you on the way out larry after the scandal you get the sordid details this is what i hate were now getting the sordid details with eliot spitzer former governor apparently when he was out whoring during sex he would always wear his black socks i know what you are thinking thanks dave for searing that image in our brains for me the only thing i keep on is my hair piece black socks well for heavens sakes who does this guy think he is rosie odonnell
1474257 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
1474258 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

1474260 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
1474261 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
1474262 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
1474263 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
1474264 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
1474265 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
1474266 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
1474267 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
1474268 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
1474269 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
1474270 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
1474271 hey i have a cover song from new found glory and its called kiss me do you guys want it so you can get the credit for that too
1474272 when we look at potential markets to expand into we analyze roughly 50 variables and closely scrutinize about a dozen of those indianapolis scored very favorably on almost every single one of those 12 most critical elements and we think it will be a terrific market for us
1474273 what we do when we launch a market is establish a thorough distribution network for our weekly jobs newspaper to make sure that job seekers are able to find a copy with relative ease
1474274 we will also partner with local media to establish a co branded career center micro site on their web site so while we might on occasion do a direct mail or an out of home campaign the vast majority of our exposure to employers and jobseekers is achieved through our print web radio and tv media channels
1474275 it was a time of awareness and women fighting for specific causes that meant a lot to us
1474276 as far as my part i wrote a lot of songs
1474277 i was there to learn about the rights of women and the rights of men and what we should do together to better the world
1474278 i dont know how else to take it all i can do is laugh
1474279 i was surprised to see rita macneils name mainly because i didnt know that she had been involved in feminist groups in the early 80s
1474280 they were being spied on because at the time they were perceived to be very radical
1474281 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that
1474282 the police didnt perceive that this change was coming about because they werent looking in that direction basically
1474283 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1474284 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery

1474290 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1474291 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1474292 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1474293 unfortunately theyre also dealing with a u s economy thats looking very much to be in recession
1474294 if it stays down it probably will relieve some of the pressure on manufacturers and exporters

1474520 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1474521 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1474522 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1474523 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

1474527 now im starting to embrace it and it makes life easier
1474528 a friendly facilitative goal oriented and proactive public sector most invariably enhances the image of the government and accelerates a countrys development the converse has tended to weaken many a government and retard development
1474529 we are all aware of the host of problems often encountered by entrepreneurs and investors who wish to register businesses or acquire land for investments
1474530 relevant information takes several months either to be communicated to interested parties or are often forgotten about altogether the list is inexhaustible
1474531 the public must now be able to demand service that is non discriminatory delivered promptly and with due courtesy
1474532 gather ye rosebuds while ye may old time is still a flying and this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying
1474533 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
1474534 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
1474535 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
1474536 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1474537 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1474538 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books

1474543 sweet lord was first and foremost a fan appreciation thing and secondly a statement to all of those who said i sold out it is me saying here im giving away an album that couldve generated a minimum of a quarter of a million dollars for me and 9th but i dont make music for the money nor did i sign to warner bros for the money
1474544 hopefully the free download of sweet lord makes that abundantly clear
1474545 i signed to warner for the opportunity to compete with rappers on another level to promote peace and love to a mainstream audience to bring everything we represent in our indie hip hop world to the forefront and throw it in americas face
1474546 thats what my album murs for president is it is a literal shout out to the world its me screaming out that yes the hip hop generation is intelligent yes we do care and at the same time we can still have fun while being decent human beings
1474547 i am the fresh breath of air in an industry that is bereft of good human beings not only are they bad rappers but they are just bad people what decent human makes songs about murdering other humans or selling poison to other people the time for that bs is over im taking a stand for our kids our community and our culture so if youre looking for someone who represents positive intelligent and fun rap music sept 30th vote murs for president

1474555 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1474556 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1474557 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1474558 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1474559 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1474560 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1474561 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1474562 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1474563 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1474564 this code of conduct would be one important step toward our shared goals of promoting freedom of expression and protecting the privacy of internet users around the world
1474565 i look forward to learning more about the details of this agreement and whether it will adequately regulate american companies operating in internet restricting countries

1474567 apply the principles of evidence based medicine to the field of complementary medicine such that those treatments which demonstrably do generate more good than harm become part of conventional medicine and those which fail to meet this criterion become obsolete
1474568 weve found it necessary to engage an additional hand to our technical crew so that our ambition of returning to the african scene on a high note as well as win the league this season can be realized emordi is one of the best coaches in the land and we want to reap from his wealth of experience
1474569 it was chaotic and almost impossible to keep a log of people coming in and out
1474570 it is plain visible that individuals have gain sic access to remove items from the stores ive found vandalized cash registers and atms sic machines
1474571 greetings my friend we are all interested in the future for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives
1474572 transhumanism is the idea that its ok to transcend the limitations of the body and brain and take control of reproduction
1474573 and add to that the belief that its probably a good idea
1474574 within 30 years we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence shortly thereafter the human era will be ended
1474575 you might get things in the next 10 or 20 years that would have taken 200 years before
1474576 i guess my real motivation is the desire to not have a lot of clutter around me and just have one computer or one brain interface
1474577 the more tangible advantage of the efficiency is that you could have better emergency responses and better human experiences
1474578 eating kind of distracts me from whatever else im doing
1474579 im kind of weird that way im more concerned with my health than how things taste ive always cared about maximizing my happiness
1474580 it goes back to the enlightenment about 400 years or so
1474581 and when you go back to those original ideas you see a number of things emerging among them the notion that science and tech can be applied to human affairs and things can be engineered and improved upon
1474582 our paleolithic selves had certain limitations and invented technologies to allow us to get beyond them for us theres continuity between what happened then and what were talking about now
1474583 there are some guys who put a lot of faith in the code
1474584 others of us are more interested in the social dimension and global collaboration there are a lot of different baggages we bring to these things
1474585 theres been more than half a century of research indicating that caloric restriction in animal models works
1474586 it goes back to studies in the 1940s that show that if you feed laboratory animals less calories they live much longer and age better
1474587 thats basically the production of molecules that can damage the body
1474588 theyre molecules that can oxidize proteins or dna all the major building blocks of cells and bodies the thought is that the more we eat and the longer we live the more we damage these cells and if you eat less then you create less damage
1474589 there are people who believe in this and are doing it
1474590 the problem is they dont appear particularly happy or healthy on the question of quality of life its very difficult most people would be miserable
1474591 the french eat all these fats breads cheeses and do lots of things they shouldnt do and they actually live longer and have less disease than we do in north america
1474592 and its been proposed that they live longer because they drink a lot of red wine and its not just the wine but the red pigment actually seems to have beneficial properties
1474593 there appears to be a connection between that compound and slowing down oxidation damage
1474594 in other words theres now for the first time the potential for having a drug that will mimic the effects of things that no one wants to do like caloric restriction or severe exercise itll be a drug well all happily pay a lot of money to pop down and the pharmaceutical industry will happily make a killing on it
1474595 i think we have a 50 percent chance of getting there in around 25 years so long as the early proof of concept work in mice is well enough funded for the next 10 years or so
1474596 the sens concept is inspired by the realization that human metabolism is far too complex and interconnected to improve bio medically in the foreseeable future and that an alternative akin to repair and maintenance of man made machines is far more promising
1474597 as soon as we get that gerontologists the world over will be on television saying yes aubrey was right the repair and maintenance approach to postponing aging really is feasible after all
1474598 the debate is largely framed by transhumanists who are looking for rationales for all the enhancement technologies
1474599 and its framed on the other side by people largely motivated by religious or conservative concerns those people are either fearful of this technology or see it as a rallying cry for conservative social positions
1474600 thats based on a lot of assumptions that we really dont know about the brain
1474601 voil une petite entr e qui fait du bien m me ceux qui ne sont pas vraiment amateurs de betteraves
1474602 or something like that after getting home the kids took a nap i went to the community center and tried to get some exercise in the lap pool that evening we took the kids to see kung fu panda
1474603 oh my daughter was the bee at the halloween party
1474604 weve looked at it and weve asked students the last several years to wear proper sized clothing
1474605 most comply but some do not they give a bad reputation to those who do comply hoodies can be an issue so we eliminated the hoodies
1474606 all were asking the kids to do is wear a collared shirt and clothes that fit
1474607 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1474608 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1474609 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1474610 because it wasnt really what i would consider a farmers market there was some produce from local farmers which was cool but there was a lot of crafts and homemade goods that had nothing to do with farming they even had a table where you could register to vote
1474611 were looking at the afl coming to louisville and you cant have two teams here so we may relocate the fire to make room for the afl
1474612 the whole object is the dream to bring a major league team in here
1474613 louisville is moving up to a level far beyond the cities in that league
1474614 while the presidents general approval ratings may be down in the 30s among the gop faithful the numbers are up in the 60s
1474615 if john mccain had had his way i wouldnt be here
1474616 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
1474617 we have cast the golfs core components in a precise new mold
1474618 the golf is the global icon car making so the architecture and graphic form of new model are also absolutely clear and unique
1474619 it is more accentuated more three dimensional than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
1474620 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1474621 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1474622 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1474623 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1474624 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1474625 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change
1474626 ao longo dos anos temos expressado nossa preocupa o com o desaparecimento dos primatas mas agora temos dados s lidos que mostram que a situa o muito mais cr tica do que hav amos imaginado
1474627 a destrui o das florestas tropicais sempre foi a causa principal mas agora parece que a ca a uma amea a s ria em algumas reas mesmo quando o habitat est intacto

1474630 os micos le es selvagens estavam quase extintos mas eram muito populares nos zool gicos havia uma grande popula o em cativeiro por isso zool gicos ao redor do mundo decidiram unir for as para introduzir um programa de reprodu o em cativeiro e reintroduzir os micos le es no brasil
1474631 popula es de ambos os animais agora est o bem protegidas mas ainda s o pouco numerosas gerando uma necessidade urgente de reflorestamento para prover novos habitats para sua sobreviv ncia no longo prazo

1474638 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1474639 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
1474640 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1474641 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
1474642 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1474643 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1474644 that is what we were trying to do but it did not work
1474645 if people voted for self interest instead of self regard there wouldnt be a republican party
1474646 i didnt complain when gas was over 4 gal i figured i was just getting better gas
1474647 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474648 the average person just doesnt know who obama is whereas people know mcsame he is a
1474649 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
1474650 if people voted for self interest instead of self regard there wouldnt be a republican party
1474651 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
1474652 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474653 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
1474654 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474655 if people voted for self interest instead of self regard there wouldnt be a republican party
1474656 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474657 yeah take that miss cameron one of us noisy grubby little boys that you kicked out of the library for getting bubble gum an the sports illustrated magazines is runnin the whole f in country now in your face
1474658 the average person just doesnt know who obama is whereas people know mcsame he is a
1474659 are you one of the old coots trying to stop the turning of the tides and the passing of the seasons
1474660 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1474661 the average person just doesnt know who obama is whereas people know mcsame he is a
1474662 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
1474663 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1474664 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1474665 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1474666 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1474667 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1474668 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1474669 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1474670 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1474671 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1474672 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1474673 what i am saying is the government needs to establish a set of proper procedures for keeping peoples dna
1474674 i think the government are building a national database by stealth they are finding whatever means they can to get your dna sample i think that is wrong without it being properly debated in parliament and without proper safeguards
1474675 i am not necessarily against it i would listen very carefully to the arguments i would look at what safeguards are in place and who can access the information but until we have a debate in parliament it remains a grey area
1474676 my case has had a certain amount of publicity but there are one million people like me who have never been charged with any crime whose dna is being held
1474677 it is one of those murders that i think will be quite hard to solve because there is no apparent motive my uncle as far as we are aware had no enemies in life he was an 80 year old man living on his own and wasnt well off my best guess is it was a burglary gone wrong
1474678 he has received correspondence saying this request will be honoured
1474679 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1474680 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1474681 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country
1474682 a step too far for the british way of life
1474683 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
1474684 would need to ask for our permission to bring any suspects to diego garcia they have not done so and no suspected terrorists are being held on diego garcia
1474685 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1474686 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1474687 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1474688 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1474689 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1474690 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
1474691 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
1474692 i dont remember anyone talking about knowing they were being videotaped in those meetings but if you have the khadr videotape and this statement that seems pretty clear the question is did the u s destroy everything
1474693 interrogators from recognized human rights abusing regimes onto the u s military base
1474694 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist and that contrary to what the military says it was absolutely sop
1474695 i would be shocked if they had not been destroyed
1474696 i think theres no question if you invite someone in and they threaten them the person who invited them in should be held accountable
1474697 we will request any and all videotapes by u s and foreign intelligence services to find out what was being done to them and what threats were made against them
1474698 lawsuit maybe flying your way still go and spend so much money shopping
1474699 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1474700 the investigators looked around they decided they had to find somebody they went after all of them but he looked the most susceptible to pressure
1474701 it is like prisoners of war if they are harassed enough they will be driven to do anything but i dont believe he would have done what they say he did
1474702 they asked if we could put together a list of questions we would like to have answered just to get an idea of just exactly what happened
1474703 it is a relief to know that they have found something
1474704 it has been seven years now but it may end up still that they dont really know why this happened or what happened
1474705 the finding that the attack material could be traced definitively to a u s bioweapons research lab could and should have been released as soon is it was obtained
1474706 we zijn hier met geloof in eigen kunnen na vorige week is ons vertrouwen niet geschonden
1474707 in de heenmatch hadden we een vijftal doelkansen terwijl bate vooral vanaf afstand probeerde daar klamp ik me als trainer aan vast
1474708 bob murphy needs to make up his mind does he want to be a judge or does he want to serve in the state senate the people of senate district 21 have a right to know
1474709 bob murphy is clearly more comfortable working with the trial lawyers who are funding 70 percent of his campaign than he is with serving the citizens of senate district 21
1474710 with bob murphy in such a hurry to get back to a judges bench it really shows his lack of commitment to winning the senate district 21 seat
1474711 the democrats are spinning to the media and the public that they can hold the senate district 21 seat but bob murphys application to get his old job back paints a very different picture of their true feelings about this race
1474712 i know who you are i wanna get to know you
1474713 on a temporary medical leave of absence and will return to the production upon recovery
1474714 he has tumors on his brain that can grow on any vital organ he also has them on his face he has them on his eyes he has them on his gums he has kidney manifestations as well
1474715 its more common than cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy it affects people in a very dramatic way
1474716 it is probably one of the leading causes of autism
1474717 about 25 percent of people with tsc are on the autism spectrum
1474718 in tsc we think its fairly equal between boys and girls
1474719 the association of tsc and autism is intriguing because it is so common in this disorder and if we could understand it here we could understand autism better in general
1474720 its not going to how much you love your child its just going to change the way you help your child
1474721 i try to get the best value i can because i have to buy in bulk
1474722 i think everyone is looking for bargains today with gas prices if they can save somehow someway theyll do it
1474723 a timeless exploration of politics religion and power robert bolts classic drama is based on the fascinating true story of english chancellor sir thomas more and his moral objection to king henry viiis plan to leave the catholic church
1474724 their best efforts to do right by the law and sound science have been subverted by actions taken by or not taken by johnson our administrator
1474725 a lot of them are certainly hurt by the impact on their professional reputations
1474726 speaks for itself and the administrator is proud of the work the staff completed at his direction
1474727 relatively ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations given the potentially damaging effect on jobs and the u s economy
1474728 we believe epas hardworking dedicated staff has earned more respect than you are giving
1474729 we are trying to help make iran and western countries understand each other well we view this high level visit as an opportunity for the role we play
1474730 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1474731 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1474732 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1474733 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1474734 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1474735 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1474736 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1474737 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

1474746 quintessential police force mentality and as the challenges of modern policing reveal it is not especially effective and becomes a slippery slope of ever greater constraints on freedom
1474747 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1474748 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1474749 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1474750 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1474751 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1474752 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1474753 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1474754 who are open to doing something on the production side
1474755 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1474756 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1474757 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1474758 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1474759 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1474760 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1474761 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1474762 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1474763 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1474764 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1474765 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1474766 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1474767 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1474768 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1474769 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1474770 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1474771 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1474772 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1474773 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1474774 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1474775 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1474776 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1474777 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1474778 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1474779 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1474780 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1474781 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1474782 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

1474787 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1474788 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1474789 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1474790 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1474791 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1474792 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1474793 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1474794 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1474795 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1474796 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1474797 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1474798 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1474799 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1474800 it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence liberates others

1474807 we support our troops and call upon president bush and congress to seek a peaceful compromise with iran as admiral fox fallon has stated the use the threat of force towards iran is not the answer and will only complicate an already volatile situation in that region
1474808 i have been watching with increasing alarm the move toward war on iran no diplomacy an exact duplicate of iraq
1474809 they want us to go into iran but we cant afford it it is unfair to iranians and to our soldiers
1474810 the best thing we could do right now is put them all in straight jackets
1474811 once again we are beating the drums of war on the assumption that another country has weapons that our own intelligence has shown they do not have
1474812 im here because over 4 000 of our soldiers died over lies and i see us heading straight for iran over the same lies
1474813 the citizens responsibility to see that our troops are not sent anywhere not absolutely necessary
1474814 then we need to start paying someone who will do the job
1474815 i would like to see this country do less for corporate needs and more for human needs and when we are exporting democracy i hope that that would mean something other than the freedom of corporations to make money anyway they can
1474816 my stepson has just gotten orders to deploy to iraq
1474817 the idea of him going over there to support illegal wars
1474818 im here to try to bring attention to this potential iran war by this administration and how weve had false flag ops leading to occupations of countries we cant put that burden on our military again we support the troops but dont support the war policies that the bush administration is pursuing
1474819 instead of using diplomacy is using saber rattling to escalate war in the middle east and an attack on iran specifically

1474823 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1474824 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1474825 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

1474840 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1474841 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1474842 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1474843 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1474844 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1474845 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1474846 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1474847 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1474848 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1474849 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

1474940 the hebrews were located geographically in the ancient middle east and during most of their long history were under the sovereignty of powers greater than themselves yet remarkably they were the only one of those peoples to succeed in maintaining themselves through the centuries as a culture it was primary their unique religion which sustained them making them capable of withstanding those forces of absorption and disintegration which would have removed them as a people from the stage of history

1474995 the language in the statement seems a little less hawkish than in june but hardly represents a significant shift in the feds stance
1474996 in every statement since august 2006 the fed has expected inflation to moderate in the next few quarters from the perspective that inflation is measured by the cpi and or ppi a perspective i soundly disagree with they probably have it correct finally
1474997 the statement changed the bias notably form last month when the fed said risks were balanced the august statement stated although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee thats much more hawkish than the most recent fomc statement
1474998 if you can put this into perspective thats 80 more people that are alive compared to the same time last year so this isnt some little fluctuation
1474999 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1475000 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1475001 i knew i had the talent to get in with a hit record i thought if i could just get that song and get signed with a record label and a good manager somebody who believes in me i can do it i didnt have any qualms about that so i had the confidence because i had a god given voice so it was already there i didnt have to work on it too much in order to get it across but then you think i wonder where the next one is coming from and then it goes on and on and on like that
1475002 ive learned you have to go to where they are kids sometimes dont like going into a theatre as such they want to be in a rock concert or somewhere where they can get up and dance so i tried to play a lot of different kind of venues but the one problem is when you get them all in one room and the kids want to come down in front and some of the older fans are sitting there and saying sit down i cant see so you have this problem of trying to please a lot of different people from a lot of different age groups
1475003 we worked from scratch really as opposed to the old way where people would send you a song you get an arranger to make an arrangement and you go into the studio and record it this is all from scratch so its a different way of doing it for me it takes more time but i think the end result is better
1475004 its a crapshoot at best so you just do what you feel and try and get the right people around you and the songwriters and the right sound make sure youre listening to whats happening rather than saying oh yeah well just get on with it and all of a sudden theyve pressed it and you hear it and then you cant change it so ive learned ive got to be there listening to the tracks and listening to the stuff be more a part of it so hopefully it will work
1475005 i think its important to give people something to watch as well as listen to you know what i mean
1475006 i always use a microphone in the left hand because once you grab a microphone that hand is dead you know what i mean you cant do anything with it but a lot of right handed people they hold the microphone with their right hand and then they dont know what to do with their left hand i learned that when i first started off
1475007 i think theyre great the seven kids that ive seen theyve all got their own thing which is a very important thing rather than hearing some voices sometimes that you know theyre copying somebody because the phrasing is the same and thats ok if you want to go into a show where you want to be a tina turner but if you want to be yourself you have to have your own identity

1475012 he continued on what would become a spree of violent random assaults by next striking a doorman from majestic in the head as well as three patrons on the patio
1475013 the man then fled the restaurant but not before he struck one more person in the head on the way out
1475014 the suspect attempted to flee but was tackled by the man who was also struck in the head with the hammer
1475015 an imitation firearm two knives and a hammer were seized by police
1475016 were not saying that we know exactly what his motivation was
1475017 i did hear that someone heard him ranting saying a lot of things so its possible he could have said something
1475018 that may just take a little time to sift through a lot of what he was saying
1475019 ive got a call into our hate crime unit to see if there is anything to substantiate anything at all
1475020 he doesnt have much contact with the vancouver police at all
1475021 he doesnt have much in the way of a criminal history so this really has come out of the blue for the most part other than theres some indication that there have been other contacts with police that have the mental health aspect to them
1475022 we didnt see it homophobia and the police also dont see that
1475023 i think its one of these very very random situations
1475024 this is my livelihood i want to make a name for myself
1475025 i also have to do it for boxing canada this is make or break if i do well in this tournament it can do well for our future fighters in this country
1475026 i dont want to call it a monkey on the back
1475027 i dont think we came back with the thought of fixing something so much has changed
1475028 the further you get from the athens regatta the less important it becomes i think that has evolved in the last three or four weeks the closer we get to the first race the less important is the last four years
1475029 i cant worry so much about the medal we are going to win
1475030 i think we have to win by the fact the team is a great team as a unit
1475031 if you are not prepared for the olympics its quite overwhelming
1475032 ive already walked through this pass before and i feel much more prepared
1475033 if they are seeing canadian fighters for the first time they dont know us from adam
1475034 its important you come familiar with the different countries and different system with fighters in those countries
1475035 we noticed when they were out there but we noticed when everyone was out there
1475036 there is that feeling we owe them one when you are out on the course you try to be as sharp as you can
1475037 if this is a meaningful breakout after having traded in a tight range for so long the risk is really that well see slightly weaker canadian dollar levels
1475038 im a little concerned that weve had close to three weeks straight u s dollar gains here and no sign of a correction so it is perhaps from our perspective starting to look a little bit stretched
1475039 you thought it should have provided a bit of a lift to the bond market instead we had a bit of a selloff right across the board
1475040 i think the greater worry perhaps here is supply and that may be whats casting the negative tone in the bond market and of course thats filtering across the border
1475041 the federal government has apologized to the chinese first nations and japanese community in parliament
1475042 this is not fair to the whole indo canadian community
1475043 beginning with the chinese immigration act of 1885 a head tax of 50 was imposed on chinese newcomers in an attempt to deter immigration for over six decades these race based financial measures aimed solely at the chinese were implemented with deliberation by the canadian state this was a grave injustice and one we are morally obligated to acknowledge therefore mr speaker on behalf of all canadians and the government of canada we offer a full apology to chinese canadians for the head tax and express our deepest sorrow for the subsequent exclusion of chinese immigrants
1475044 nearly half a century ago in the crisis of wartime the government of canada wrongfully incarcerated seized the property and disenfranchised thousands of citizens of japanese ancestry
1475045 we cannot change the past but we must as a nation have the courage to face up to these historical facts
1475046 i know i speak for members of all sides of the house in offering to japanese canadians the formal and sincere apology of this parliament for those past injustices against them their families and their heritage and our solemn commitment to canadians of every origin that they will never again be countenanced or repeated
1475047 those who governed in london at the time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy
1475048 i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice it serves no one for the wrong people to be convicted for such an awful crime
1475049 we come here today partly in recognition of the fact that we in the united states and the world community did not do as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit what occurred
1475050 allowing us all to feel good about ourselves for berating policies in which we played no part
1475051 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party
1475052 but im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
1475053 to me its headed to the essence festival level we already have new sponsors calling to be a part of next year and i cant wait
1475054 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks

1475057 back in the days when i was a teenager before i had status and before i had a pager you could find the abstract listening to hip hop my pops used to say it reminded him of bebop
1475058 so jet to the store and buy the lp on j i v e unfortunately
1475059 it came out wrong basically im not 1 anymore and that sucks call it my princess complex
1475060 2 at the end so i removed it to see what would happen
1475061 ultimately financial matters are personal and we work to respect the privacy of the families
1475062 we wont enforce against owners of apartment buildings if their tenants dont do this
1475063 mr so and so your practice of sorting out garbage is wrong please correct it
1475064 i checked inside bags and took especially lousy ones back to the owners front doors

1475088 as it is you who told the story i would like to believe but something does not seem right
1475089 i dont know much myself but i have read from a book once in this world sometimes a person with supernatural powers exists and can teleport to a place where that person is thinking of perhaps when you were almost hit by a truck you used the supernatural powers that you did not know you had to move through time and space
1475090 i dont think something like that can happen at all thats not scientific thats against common sense
1475091 but things that cant be understood through common sense do occur in this world

1475106 i saw one on saturday night harass a group of white men and then tried to punch one through an open window because they ignored him
1475107 vigilantes cleaned up the old west wild or not by hanging horse thieves and cattle rustlers after summary kangaroo trials
1475108 whenever my crew and i drive by there in the evenings some days too its the usual crowd hanging out though it would be so un pc of me to assume that they are selling using illicit substances
1475109 i saw five blacks beating the heck out of a white guy with a baseball bat i took off running to try to find a cop and there were none anywhere the guys disappeared into the shadows of the night as quick as they arrived

1475131 entre actuaciones individuales sumadas a las del grupo nos han hecho observar un equipo aparentemente sin alma sigo esperanzado y confiado por lo que veo en los entrenamientos y me refiero a la actitud de los jugadores en el trabajo y eso hay que trasladarlo a los partidos
1475132 lo que vimos en el ltimo partido fue una demostraci n de falta de actitud futbol stica dedo darle seguridad y confianza al jugador y que ellos se reencuentren consigo mismos esa es mi gran motivaci n como t cnico

1475364 only the rich made out well we were told they owned assets and asset prices have soared but if you quote stock prices or housing prices in terms of the number of gallons of gasoline they will buy you find that even the rich arent as rich as they think they are the dow would get you about 2 200 gallons of gas in 1968 today at 4 10 a gallon the dow is equal to about 2 200 gallons
1475365 britons who still have any wealth to invest are turning their backs on the property portfolios stocks and shares and sports cars that have long constituted conventional investments and pumping their savings into old fashioned gold bullion and coins

1475367 leading gold bullion suppliers bullionvault ats bullion and baird amp co have all revealed record levels of investment in gold bars and the world gold council wgc has reported a big increase in the number of gold coins being bought

1475371 between movements in the headline cpi and concept of inflation that is detailed in economic theory
1475372 at present prices are rising for energy and food products and for some products and services directly affected by these sectors however the cost increases induced by these price hikes are not being generally passed on to other product types prices in most other sectors are tranquil even declining furthermore one cant credibly make an argument that the energy and food price hikes are being sustained by fed policy
1475373 concerted fed tightening would be required to dispel those problems
1475374 although food and energy prices have gone sky high price increases of other goods and services are still contained in many countries core inflation which leaves out food and energy is actually lower than it was a year ago

1475417 federal and local authorities are girding for huge protests mammoth traffic tie ups and civil disturbances at the democratic national convention in denver this month fearing that the convention will become a magnet for militant protest groups
1475418 officials say that what makes denver different than past conventions is the historic nature of senator barack obamas nomination a megawattage event whose global spotlight could draw tens of thousands of demonstrators including self described anarchists who the police fear will infiltrate peaceful protest groups to disrupt the weeklong event
1475419 as a result the secret service the pentagon the federal bureau of investigation and scores of police departments are moving thousands of agents analysts officers and employees to denver for the aug 25 28 convention they will operate through a complex hierarchy of command centers steering committees and protocols to respond to disruptions
1475420 similar preparations are under way for the republican convention in minnesota
1475421 but without the harsh glare that at the moment seems to be focused on denver st pauls 600 member police force will grow nearly sixfold with about 3 000 additional officers arriving from around minnesota as well as from iowa illinois wisconsin and the dakotas said tom walsh a spokesman for the st paul police department
1475422 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1475423 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1475424 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1475425 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1475426 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector

1475442 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1475443 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1475444 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1475445 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1475446 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1475447 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1475448 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1475449 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1475450 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1475451 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1475452 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1475491 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1475492 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1475493 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home is often an extreme and visible luxury
1475494 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays

1475496 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1475497 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1475498 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1475499 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1475500 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1475501 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1475502 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1475503 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1475504 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden

1475511 never in history has a federal court invalidated a law regulating the private ownership of firearms on second amendment grounds indeed that the second amendment poses no barrier to strong gun laws is perhaps the most well settled proposition in american constitutional law

1475533 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1475575 i was fortunate in that i felt comfortable talking about it with my doctors and my husband
1475576 but many women cant they push it down and bury it never to reclaim their sexuality again its very sad

1475586 n o havia por m em todo o israel homem t o celebrado por sua beleza como absal o da planta do p ao alto da cabe a n o havia nele defeito algum
1475587 depois disto absal o fez aparelhar para si um carro e cavalos e cinq enta homens que corressem adiante dele
1475588 levantando se absal o pela manh parava entrada da porta e a todo homem que tinha alguma demanda para vir ao rei a ju zo o chamava absal o a si e lhe dizia de que cidade s tu
1475589 ent o absal o lhe dizia olha a tua causa boa e reta por m n o tens quem te ou a da parte do rei
1475590 dizia mais absal o ah quem me dera ser juiz na terra para que viesse a mim todo homem que tivesse demanda ou quest o para que lhe fizesse justi a
1475591 tamb m quando algu m se chegava para inclinar se diante dele ele estendia a m o pegava o e o beijava
1475592 desta maneira fazia absal o a todo o israel que vinha ao rei para ju zo e assim ele furtava o cora o dos homens de israel
1475593 ao cabo de quatro anos disse absal o ao rei deixa me ir a hebrom cumprir o voto que fiz ao senhor porque morando em gesur na s ria fez o teu servo um voto dizendo se o senhor me fizer tornar a jerusal m prestarei culto ao senhor
1475594 enviou absal o emiss rios secretos por todas as tribos de israel dizendo quando ouvirdes o som das trombetas direis absal o rei em hebrom
1475595 de jerusal m foram com absal o duzentos homens convidados por m iam na sua simplicidade porque nada sabiam daquele neg cio

1475598 lasted approximately 4 1 2 hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning
1475599 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1475600 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1475601 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1475602 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1475603 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1475604 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1475605 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbours drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1475606 out of the hospital feeling great and about to resume normal activities at home
1475607 he and his wife camille want to thank everyone who expressed concern
1475608 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1475609 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1475610 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1475611 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1475612 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1475613 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1475614 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1475615 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1475616 dang its cold in here why cant i have some heat its too dark i mean at least give me a flashlight they buried me in this dress ths is the ugliest dress ever i would never have picked out this dress why isnt this coffin taller it would be nice to sit up do i have to think of everything

1475627 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
1475628 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1475629 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
1475630 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1475631 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1475632 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1475633 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together
1475634 this is jeff haas your host for this hour of music exploring the art form of jazz and its connection to classic rock r amp b blues folk and more
1475635 my dads philosophy was lets make this music accessible to anyone and everyone
1475636 my goal and its a lofty one is to sort of extend that vibe of accessibility engaging people on an emotional level with great music
1475637 most people dont commonly associate jazz with other types of music but in reality all popular music in this country comes from jazz
1475638 at first i was wondering if i might be boxing myself in maybe i would run out of connections in a year or so
1475639 but the possibilities are really endless someone was influenced by someone else or covered one of their tunes or shared the same mentors so many different avenues to explore
1475640 the music engages people opens hearts and minds on a level that you couldnt effectively do through words
1475641 im sure there will be some hard core classical music listeners who wont be interested in jeffs show but most of our audience came of age listening to the beatles and elvis and abba and mancini in the 60s and 70s my guess is theyll have a more inclusive attitude than their parents did about what makes great music
1475642 i bring my own musical biases to the table and the opportunity to produce this show has helped me address them
1475643 its really about the challenge of keeping an open mind
1475644 i find it kind of bizarre given what we were doing
1475645 when i look back i cant recall anything that would have been a threat to anyone to think that we were being watched its a surprise
1475646 i dont think they had a reason to be following what we were doing unless they were on to something else i dont know about
1475647 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1475648 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1475649 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about
1475650 all of those songs would have been sung at rallies demonstrations or meetings that we attended
1475651 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1475652 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1475653 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1475654 fleeced how barack obama media mockery of terrorist threats liberals who want to kill talk radio the do nothing congress companies that help iran and washington lobbyists for foreign governments are scamming us and what to do about it
1475655 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1475656 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1475657 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1475658 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book
1475659 books from both the left and the right often work this way

1475662 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1475663 i am so angry with them they dont care about offending other people i wish i knew where they all lived so that i could set a bible on fire and ring their door bell and run maybe that would offend them and they can see how they like it
1475664 i would love to find out where each of them live and go set a bible on fire on their door step and ring the door bell and run

1475669 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1475670 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1475671 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you

1475674 i have nothing to hope in god for now i gave him everything i trusted him and now this i do not believe any longer
1475675 if we are in communion with god and recognize that he is taking us into his purposes we shall no longer try to find out what his purposes are as we go on in the christian life it gets simpler because we are less inclined to say now why did god allow this and that behind the whole thing lies the compelling of god theres a divinity that shapes our ends

1475696 if you walked by a street and you was walking a concrete and you saw a rose growing from concrete even if it had messed up petals and it was a little to the side you would marvel at just seeing a rose grow through concrete so way is it that when you see some ghetto kid grow out of the dirtiest circumstance and he can talk and he can sit across the room and make you cry make you laugh all you can talk about is my dirty rose my dirty stems and how am leaning crooked to the side u cant even see that ive come up from out of that

1475714 theres gonna be some stuff u gonna see thats gonna make it hard to smile in the future but through whatever you see through all the rain and all the pain you gotta keep your sense of humor you gotta be able to smile through all this bullsh t
1475715 i am crazy but you know what else i dont give a fuck
1475716 my mama used to tell me if u cant find somethin to live for you best find somethin to die for

1475718 biggie is not a playa hes never been hes never had bitches until he got some fuckin money thats a not a playa
1475719 i said it in the beginning that i was gonna take them niggaz out the game and sure enough i will already people cant look at biggie and not laugh
1475720 stole my lyrics i stole his bitch took my rhymes i took his wife if he talk all that shit about being a playa and i got his wife two days after i got outta jail imagine that gangsta shit hes talking imagine how plastic that shit is

1475725 to me it really troubling because i took ouver at thats successful marky mark hammer vanilla ice new kids on the block selling twenty two million copies and i want that so badly but i cant do that i would be wrong to do that knowing what i know and having the brain that i have for me to even go and write some simple shit would be wrong even though i would get paid and i would get more peoples money i would rather leave something so that when people pick up 2pacalypse now or any of my other albums in 1999 theyll go damn brothers had it hard back in the day but brother were working it out
1475726 the real tragedy is that there are some ignorant brothers out here thats why im not on this all white or all black shit im on this all real or all fake shit with people whatever color you are because niggaz will do you i mean theres some foul niggaz out there in the streets the same niggaz that did malcolm x the same niggaz that did jesus christ every brother aint a brother they will do you so just because its black dont mean its cool and just because its white dont mean its evil
1475727 i remember crying all the time my major thing growing up was i couldnt fit in because i was from everywhere i didnt have no buddies that i grew up with every time i had to go to a new apartment i had to reinvent myself myself people think just because you born in the ghetto you gonna fit in a little twist in your life and you dont fit in no matter what if they push you out of the hood and the white peoples world thats criminal hell i felt like my could be destroyed at any moment

1475731 i smoke blunt to take the pain out and if i wasnt high id probably blow my brains out
1475732 if we really are saying that rap is an art form then we got to be more responsible for our lyrics if you see everybody dying because of what you are saying it dont matter that you didnt make them die it just matters that you didnt save them
1475733 i dont see why everybody feel as thou that they gotta tell me how to live my life you know let me live baby let me live
1475734 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1475735 oh as deep as anybody ive gone as deep as you could go so far
1475736 because heres a whole group of baseball fans that were kind of outcasts or ignored or everyone said they were crazy the truth is coming out that they have some interesting things to say if i can bridge that gap a little bit im happy to do that
1475737 why jason bay makes the red sox a better team
1475738 sure they are in that hes got impact on the checks on the bridge of his nose over his shoulder over the backs of his hands and knuckles and even down around his knees and his chins
1475739 gentle little people about 3 to 4 feet tall wearing halloween masks

1475743 we waited outside for about three quarters of an hour
1475744 were taking care of the customers and employees thats the most important thing
1475745 what is left to be done is all the work that happens underground that people wont see like the all track work the electrical work the finishings of the tunnels and the stations that represents the last 20
1475746 the area from the south end of the cambie bridge to about 8th avenue is still tied up in terms of reduced traffic lanes due partly to the tunnel were finishing plus finishing work were doing in that area
1475747 americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too long relative to what we traditionally spend on the military and more importantly relative to the responsibilities and challenges our nation has around the world
1475748 the most persistent and potentially dangerous threats will come less from emerging ambitious states than from failing ones that cannot meet the basic needs much less the aspirations of their people
1475749 question why is it the military who seems to be the public proponent of increasing america s capacity in non military engagement
1475750 propaganda economic warfare preventive direct action including sabotage anti sabotage demolition and evacuation measures subversion against hostile states including assistance to underground resistance groups and support of indigenous anti communist elements in threatened countries of the free world
1475751 by the early 1950s wisner owned respected members of the new york times newsweek cbs and other communications vehicles
1475752 except this one called pulau perak its about 10km from penang and its the size of a rock its listed down in the map
1475753 this could have been done any time over the last five years
1475754 a considerable amount of money has been spent to monitor these plots which are used to determine natural growth and recovery of our forests since the plantation era and changes in our forests due to natural events such as hurricanes
1475755 please remember that the national park service has many authorized activities besides research that benefit the parks its visitors and residents
1475756 please do not remove tags or signs indicating trail or road locations construction work renovation of any type safety warnings or educational information
1475757 dude just doesnt smile man it really looks like were taking a picture with a cardboard jared except they probably dont design cardboard jareds to hold paper plate of food
1475758 it shows the progress of the fishermen and the auxiliary on st thomas they have noticed the fishermen who have lost their lives
1475759 its another way for us to give to the community
1475760 the fact is drilling in protected areas offshore will not reduce the price at the pump
1475761 big oil with its billions of dollars in record profits wants more taxpayer lands and republicans are happy to oblige
1475762 the medical staff of the schneider regional medical center wish to inform the public that the recent events in our facility have not diminished the commitment that the medical staff nursing and ancillary personnel have for the people of the virgin islands
1475763 these recent events were equally shocking and disturbing to us this will not change our relationship that we now have with you we will maintain excellence in our care build on the successes of the past and continue our work to make schneider regional medical center the best health care facility in the eastern caribbean
1475764 an alarming depth of mismanagement of medical center funds and a complete lack of oversight of these monies
1475765 i think this is a step in the right direction
1475766 as we know many employees in the territory continue to be plagued by bad working conditions
1475767 there is no reason why employers need to force their employees under threat of loss of their livelihoods to sit through these indoctrinations
1475768 free speech is a two way street employers should have the right to express their opinions but their workers should have the right not to listen
1475769 just to keep employees from being allowed to vote for a labor organization
1475770 i want to encourage again employees in the private sector not to be afraid to attend meetings to unionize their shop
1475771 possibly one of the greatest tools for democratization and individual freedom that weve ever seen
1475772 the panels decision shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute and the parties shall immediately take whatever action is necessary to carry out and effectuate the decisions
1475773 we want to get beyond hearsay rumors and voodoo in figuring out what this means
1475774 were trying to attack the system that creates poverty the only way we can do that is with real figures and real research
1475775 where we need to start as regulators of government and societies is how can we keep living affordable
1475776 one of them i think is education and the way our society values it just remember giving people more money doesnt necessarily take them out of poverty
1475777 mejoramiento de la calidad y nivel de los servicios tecnol gicos de apoyo a la docencia
1475778 i prefer the hitlerian method of finding them guilty and a quick firing squad
1475779 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1475780 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1475781 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1475782 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1475783 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1475784 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1475785 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1475786 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1475787 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1475788 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1475789 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1475790 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1475791 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1475792 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1475793 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1475794 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1475795 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1475796 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1475797 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1475798 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1475799 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1475800 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1475801 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1475802 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1475803 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1475804 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1475805 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1475806 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1475807 didnt really have time to run and check the internet before saving his pregnant wifes life
1475808 if the name is anything to go by it is without doubt malware
1475809 if the name is anything to go by it is without doubt gt malware
1475810 if the name is anything to go by it is without gt doubt gt malware
1475811 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity
1475812 i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1475813 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1475814 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1475815 geoffrey ballards creativity and determination established a foundation on which this company has developed proton exchange membrane pem fuel cell technology
1475816 his name will forever be associated with this companys fuel cell products which are being deployed as an energy source for applications in a growing number of important global markets
1475817 the internal combustion engine will go the way of the horse it will be a curiosity to my grandchildren
1475818 although we clearly face more challenging macro economic conditions in fiscal 09 were well positioned to deliver continued if somewhat less robust growth
1475819 those whom the russians wish to destroy they first make mad
1475820 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
1475821 esto surgi cuando se comenz con el trasandino y se pidi a patrimonio la valoraci n de todas las estaciones se hicieron los relevamientos y se determin cu les son los edificios m s importantes se decidi que los principales lugares a proteger son la estaci n el galp n principal y la casa del jefe de estaci n
1475822 el plan de manejo tendr en cuenta el paisaje y la idea es que no se hagan nuevas construcciones muy pegadas a estos lugares protegidos trabajamos en una normativa que proteja todo el cuadro de estaci n hay que resguardar todo el circuito no s lo una estaci n
1475823 la idea es sacarlas del abandono y que dejen de ser un patrimonio cultural pasivo para que pasen a ser activo en el estado que estaban sirven para el vandalismo
1475824 okay guys our original plan was to head to some kind of medical building right if those guys are close to finding soggul we should find a path that so we can all intercept each other and get on our way over there im ready to go we just need to make sure we can all meet along the way weve stayed in one spot too long now
1475825 yeah i am feeling good now needed a good nap and some beer ok lets go get rich now where do you guys have the trail in relationship to the fish building

1475827 if you guys double time it over here just south of the fish freezer building then we can follow sogguls scent and meet up with him too
1475828 and hurry because this has been enough of a failure of a rescue mission already
1475829 the problem is that we would have to go back through the glowshrooms to get to the fish house right
1475830 i suppose we take a good look of that truck as we head back
1475831 nice one its on friday is going to be class
1475832 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him but he doesnt let me kat and rachel sing he just hates our singing and he goes on about it all the time
1475833 hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him and to me he shouldnt be doing that
1475834 we are looking at the largest increase in commodity and energy prices that any of us have seen including the 1970s
1475835 cutting advertising is not part of our plan to cut costs
1475836 hey kids its okay to take a chainsaw to things because all that happens is sparks come out
1475837 its about time i get whats owed to me from the situation i was stuck in
1475838 its unfortunate things have turned out the way they did but artists deserve to be compensated fairly by their labels for the work they do and that wasnt happenin in my case im happy to finally be a free man and make a new start
1475839 may your days be merry and bright and may all your christmases be white
1475840 a holiday juggernaut one well loved berlin tune after another

1475843 irving berlin was always proud of the movie white christmas and we are thrilled that it has now become a stage musical he wrote a song about christmas that became more than a song it became the highlight of one film the title song of another and a worldwide phenomenon
1475844 a holiday juggernaut theres plenty to ooh and aah over one well loved berlin tune after another
1475845 irving berlin has no place in american music he is american music
1475846 moove aalong thee waaterss eedge oon yoour reeturn joourneey sssee iif yoou caan piick uup sssogguls traail iif hee hasss coome baack too sshoore

1475848 lets stick to the waters edge cobb and pick him up again wherever he came out
1475849 once we got him we can get in touch with the rest of the guys and get them to meet us or head back to the safe house
1475850 ok guys our original plan was to head to some kind of medical building right if those guys are close to finding soggul we should find a path that so we can all intercept each other and get on our way over there im ready to go we just need to make sure we can all meet along the way weve stayed in one spot too long now
1475851 if you guys double time it over here just south of the fish freezer building then we can follow sogguls scent and meet up with him too
1475852 and hurry because this has been enough of a failure of a rescue mission already

1475871 i guess they hammered me pretty good and it kind of erupted from there
1475872 it was a chance to enlighten him about the ryder cup and pga of america activities
1475873 we saw a talented young man who would like to play in the ryder cup and knew he had made a mistake and was looking to amend those mistakes i appreciated that
1475874 because they are not relevant to what the ryder cup is today
1475875 the crowd you could hear it a mile away we had to sit at one hole and wait for people to come through and it was just crazy you could see the energy on everybodys faces
1475876 from what ive heard the ryder cup just isnt fun
1475877 the fun is sucked right out of it thats the word i hear a lot
1475878 just from the presidents cup having such a good time it was disappointing to hear about the ryder cup that it wasnt as much fun i was disappointed to hear that about an event i had looked up to as a kid
1475879 i should have said in the article how much i want to change the culture of the ryder cup and start winning

1475907 i would very much want to make it energy efficient self sufficient
1475908 its hard to tell from the reader comments its a self selecting sample
1475909 but something i set out to do is draw people to the web site in hopes that theyll stick around long enough to get the environmental messages
1475910 i did have to work up to this kind of thing it was incremental i didnt go from an office job to rowing across an ocean
1475911 my first thought was that is the best idea ive ever had of course my second thought was that was without a doubt the worst idea ive ever had
1475912 get a big brand port it to three platforms and get the efficiencies

1475925 i write with my cunt via my fingers you know that dont you in a way shes an extension of my brain so maybe if you read to her it will stimulate her
1475926 so what youre actually saying is that while men are often accused of having their brains in their cocks you actually have yours in your pussy
1475927 kinda like i said an extension an extra room if you like an annexe if you really want to stretch the analogy beyond all recognition
1475928 and if im supposed to stimulate your brain that means that i have free rein down there touchy or no touchy
1475929 put it this way any activity that goes one between my head and your pussy is bound to involve my tongue why not make it reading officially anyway
1475930 youll have to concentrate hard it will probably sound a bit muffled
1475931 i could give a fuck about muffled tell me more youre making me wet
1475932 how long will you be able to hold out on your feet do you think how long before your knees turn to butter and you collapse in a post orgasmic crumple
1475933 i want to see how long you can remain standing
1475934 but since that was such a helpful fidget ill forgive you that one time
1475935 i just make my mouth into a small circle around your utterly delicious clit and start talking at it
1475936 i have no printed smut to read to you but i wonder if youll find my rendition of the daily carbon market assessments as sexy as i do when i read them with your clit subject to the mercy of my tongue
1475937 the un system is the second biggest greenhouse gas trading program after europes
1475938 its the p p plosive sound it goes straight through my cunt like a really good vibrator
1475939 ive got you and i want to feel you come
1475940 come for me baby come in my mouth on my face surrender yourself you know you want to come god yes come baby yes thats it gush come on me all over me let me taste you god yes holy fuck

1475949 if you were to turn on rock radio in the united states theres probably 20 different pop punk type bands that sound exactly the same that sing songy bulls t
1475950 over the years you cant help but get more jaded and think a thing like a grammy in the states doesnt mean anything its not from people that matter its from old men old school business a holes that help their buddies out theres no legitimacy to it
1475951 having someone like johnny cash one of the greatest singer songwriters of all time want to cover your song thats something that matters to me its not so much what other people think but the fact that it was worthy of interpreting
1475952 woah wait youre too young to be this smart slow down here have a headache

1475954 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland said kidney
1475955 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1475956 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1475957 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks

1476017 i am more convinced than ever that the iq of organizations is the iq of the smartest person in the organization divided by the number of people that comprise the organization
1476018 to get one of these awards was just mind blowing
1476019 it was just something that really intrigued me the idea of womens contributions to early country music its kind of a good ol boys club and women had to break through that and weve kind of forgotten that
1476020 i started going a little over a decade ago and it was just very inspiring to me
1476021 and thats really how i got started getting published and making connections and doing some writing
1476022 that was where i got my first taste of creative writing
1476023 our department resurrected the campus newspaper and we have a journalism minor in our department and were working towards getting a major
1476024 i always think that a good journalist is very lyrical and uses language skillfully so there are some similarities i think
1476025 obviously the approach is different and the structure is different but any time you use language in a descriptive way whether its journalism or poetry youre pretty much doing the same thing
1476026 i prefer writing poetry but i seem to do more academic writing
1476027 i wish that i had more time to write creatively and maybe this fellowship will allow me to do that
1476028 that for me works at least in my mind as something of a theme that joins the six point of view characters
1476029 so much of what happens in their lives is the result of mis apprehensions mis communication in that way without meaning to in any direct way they sometimes thwart and even trample on the hopes of the others
1476030 i just wanted to see if i was going to be able to meet the demands of a longer narrative
1476031 my grandma taught me to read and write when i was 3 years old i was one of those strange little kids that walked around narrating what was going on
1476032 im going to be sort of dispersing it among several projects
1476033 i have a book coming out in january from fleur de lis press out of louisville and the grant money will help enormously for allowing me to travel and for promotion and some practical things like a laptop and also im hoping that there will be enough in the pot left to begin some research on a third book
1476034 at university of the cumberlands we recognize and appreciate the extraordinary caliber of our teaching faculty and it is always encouraging when organizations like the kentucky arts council corroborate our opinion
1476035 it is especially heartening to learn that out of the six al smith individual artist fellowships awards in literature given this year two honored the stellar achievements of uc faculty members nancy jensen and mary ann worthington

1476042 we do not want it we dont care for it but the women do it

1476046 while this report is full of good intentions its actual treatment of the problem is tepid and insufficient i need the irs to give me clear substantive answers on their strategic plan and its implementation to treat and resolve cases of identity theft
1476047 if you stop everything that you think is questionable then you will be damaging the interest of some legitimate taxpayers
1476048 the story you tell is not one to be proud of but theres not much for the irs to be proud of either
1476049 when a taxpayer contacts us with an issue or concern we should have in place a seamless process that gets the issue resolved promptly
1476050 from the perspective of an identity theft victim that means the taxpayer can reach someone at the irs who is knowledgeable on the issue and who is able to take care of the problem quickly and permanently
1476051 we now have a database that makes it much better to try and follow this
1476052 i think id be giving the donations if i was a lawyer in palo alto
1476053 on the other hand im a democratic lobbyist and while ive certainly survived periods of republican control its good for me to have democrats in control of congress its good for me to have a democrat in the white house so again its personal but you cant say that its not professional
1476054 iraqs large oil reserves coupled with surging oil prices offer the government of iraq the potential to contribute to the countrys reconstruction efforts and thereby enhance essential services to the iraqi people
1476055 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1476056 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1476057 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1476058 it is difficult to understand why u s taxpayer funds should be used to pay for this major infrastructure project in iraq which will be owned by the iraqi government
1476059 this report is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1476060 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding american taxpayers are paying that bill too
1476061 the oil revenues of that county could bring between 50 and 100 billion dollars over the course of the next two or three years
1476062 we are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1476063 its my local circuit and ive raced there many times so will be looking to make that count
1476064 i was second in both of those races earlier in the season and there is no reason which i cannot go better the bike is good and i am determined to go for strong results
1476065 you need to get more sleep coz sometimes you look like a zombie
1476066 beating them up is not the way to resolve things except to make me feel better
1476067 gasps outcast how can you say that beating up younger siblings relieves a lot of stress it lets out our feelings and emotions and it is better than keeping things bottled up it is also great exercise which in these obese times is never a bad thing

1476088 you dont think about that stuff when youre out there playing
1476089 im still a little sore but i felt better i took fly balls felt like i could move from side to side better estimated time of arrival is not tomorrow but the next day maybe tomorrow though
1476090 all i can go with is what the player tells me and what the staff tells me
1476091 i saw him monday and he was limping a little bit when he was taking his breaks to his right in the outfield well see how it goes i anticipate thursday or friday
1476092 this is a young player whos going through a lot of this for the first time last year i think he injured his left ankle i just know that you want him as close to 100 percent as you can get him he has to take a lot of breaks in the outfield a lot of starts and stops on the bases he needs that quick step he needs to be close to 100 percent
1476093 the concern was once i pitched it just kept getting tighter and tighter and the next day i couldnt come back
1476094 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1476095 too old to work and get around he can do nothing but let them come
1476096 its difficult because there are so many talented filmmakers out there people with really fresh and new ideas that i personally feel could bring a minor revolution to the medium of film in the 21st century
1476097 however for those filmmakers to get financing they have to follow a structure that might as well be for a studio film many times non traditional concepts dont fit into that system and thats too bad in the end its the public who loses because i know there is a huge audience for these types of films more than i think anyone in the industry is willing to accept i feel its something that is going to have to be spearheaded from within by the filmmakers themselves
1476098 we looked at a lot of different models for releases from helvetica to the cremaster cycle to head trauma at the same time exploring methods such as indie rock tours and get out the vote activities
1476099 in the end we settled on a hybrid approach that tried to incorporate different elements from each all focused around the films core inspirational message of make something from nothing
1476100 nikes support allows us to bring beautiful losers to selected cities as an event where artists can directly work with kids to foster the creative spirit while also making the vast nike base aware of the film
1476101 this has enabled us to focus on a ground game of inspiring creative communities to become part of the campaign and create a website where supporters fans filmmakers and artists can share their artwork and stories
1476102 when we decided on the concept of using frame stills from the film we identified an innovative digital printing technique to create this special collection
1476103 there are 22 nike dunk hi shoes each telling a different part of the beautiful losers story
1476104 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
1476105 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1476106 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1476107 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
1476108 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy

1476118 experience itself is a slippery commodity to measure that there is no easy way to guess what sort of political career is ideal for a president
1476119 while i think that experience as a legislative leader is important experience as a rank and file member is much less so i would not encourage state legislators to run for the presidency at least until they have had leadership experience
1476120 a visit to a senators office required a two mile drive in a motorcade with enough manpower to invade cuba

1476388 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan

1476393 sensitive and understanding but under some strain needs to unwind in the company of someone close to him
1476394 eager to make a good impression but worried and doubtful about the likelihood of succeeding feels that he has a right to anything he might hope for and becomes helpless and distressed when circumstances go against him finds the mere possibility of failure most upsetting and this can even lead to nervous prostration sees himself as a victim who has been misled and abused mistakes this dramatization for reality and tries to convince himself that his failure to achieve standing and recognition is the fault of others
1476395 willing to become emotionally involved and able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity conditions are such that he will not let himself become intimately involved without making mental reservations egocentric and therefore quick to take offense able to obtain physical satisfaction from sexual activity but tends to hold aloof emotionally circumstances are restrictive and hampering forcing him to forgo all joys and pleasures for the time being
1476396 wants to make a favorable impression and be recognized needs to feel appreciated and admired sensitive and easily hurt if no notice is taken of him or if he is not given adequate acknowledgment
1476397 disappointment and the fear that there is no point in formulating fresh goals have led to anxiety desires recognition and position but is worried about his prospects reacts to this by protecting at any criticism and resisting any attempt to influence him tries to assert himself by meticulous control of detail in an effort to strengthen his position
1476398 depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation or demands on his resources this sense of powerlessness combined with frustration that he cannot control events subjects him to agitation irritation and acute distress he tries to escape these by stubborn insistence on his own point of view but the general condition of helplessness renders this often unsuccessful is therefore very sensitive to criticism and quick to take offense
1476399 one brisk january evening nanette and i were enjoying a romantic ride in a hansom cab through new yorks central park as we rounded a brightly lit bend the cabby stopped and announced there she is wollman rink the next day i returned to the newly restored ice rink and was delighted with the bustle and noise of dozens of skaters dipping and gliding on the ice a light snow all but obscured the silhouette of the famous plaza hotel i decided to paint a nostalgic view of this winter scene

1476401 i dont believe in momentum so much but i tell you what the confidence could lead to some momentum
1476402 seeing how happy my guys were to me thats the most important part because 10 points at the end of the day is great thats wonderful but i think the championship is probably going to be settled by more than that and i feel like my guys having that little step in their walk is good
1476403 i think it could be for certain teams but not ours
1476404 carl and i i dont know what the perception is but we argue on a regular basis its not out of the ordinary for us to argue we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion we might argue again on the same subject and walk away and come back together but through the arguments and through the discussions and through the handshakes and the hugs we come to terms with what we want to do and when we want to do it and 99 percent of the time it works out for us
1476405 ill look at carl and ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1476406 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1476407 the championship ultimately winds up normally being determined by how well you do when things go bad when you have to say my cars not right
1476408 unless youve got that maturity of wisdom and presence and experience being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it because when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carls going to be ready to do that this year and im real confident
1476409 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude
1476410 there is a growing resistance stirring among the population against the use of the nedap voting computer known to be vulnerable to manipulation

1476421 i think if we would have played the whole game like we did in the third period i dont think we wouldve been in the situation where were scrambling at the end
1476422 bottom line is we played lethargic guys didnt compete we left our goaltender on an island it couldve been 12 1 had he not made those saves
1476423 i just wish the referee wouldve went through the protocol of blowing it down speaking to the goal judge getting all of his facts coming to the bench and relaying the facts

1476425 while management is developing initiatives to generate sales in the latter half of 2008 the company has slowed its development programme down both in response to current demand and to save costs where practicable
1476426 assuming no adverse unforeseen events the board does not expect that the 2008 results will run at a loss
1476427 you run a lot of these funds on the basis of one negative year in four or five this is it
1476428 the guys fund managers tend to follow a fairly formalised process where if you chose growth fund all your money goes straight into stocks and shares and thats it theres no judgment being exercised as to whether this is a good time to pour all the money in or not consequently the performance of all those funds has tended to be negative in some cases 20 per cent down
1476429 there has been enough press around that people say oh we have only lost 5 per cent
1476430 inevitably you get the people that say if they had put it in the bank they would have got 8 per cent but that is not very long term thinking

1476453 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
1476454 i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1476455 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
1476456 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right where we say things that we dont mean
1476457 so john mccain says barack would rather lose the war to win an election he just said something like that
1476458 you know despite the fact that if we had followed my recommendation not to go into the war in iraq we would have about an extra trillion dollars to rebuild our economy we would have been on the path of energy independence we would have finished the job in afghanistan and gone after al qaeda
1476459 so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
1476460 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1476461 this is just another reason to elect senator obama he does not cower and he does not bully t
1476462 but i have got the truth on my side and thats the one thing you cant abide
1476463 but i have got the truth on my side and thats the one thing you cant abide
1476464 theres more oil in the reserves than reported the wounded veteranscomplaints are dislusional the gop has a way to stop global warming only if theyre elected in office the gop has a concrete plan for immigration reform to be revealed november 5th the hiv aids epidemic is a figment of the americans imagination 100 of lost homes through foreclosure will be recovered the 2 of upper income will buy health insurance policies for all americans jobs will be created and available for all after november 5th
1476465 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts they need to do their homework
1476466 yes the republicans had a plan and in 2005 obama voted for it and mccain didnt
1476467 we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard
1476468 a day after saying the u s could produce enough renewable energy within 10 years to replace all u s imports of middle east oil
1476469 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1476470 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do obama recalled
1476471 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1476472 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1476473 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1476474 this is our moment this is out time we are what weve been waiting for
1476475 i cant believe nixon won i dont know anybody who voted for him

1476478 i didnt know about my mentor reverend wright and his racist hate filled sermons even though i went to church there for 20 years and hes one of my campaign advisers
1476479 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1476480 are americans better off than they were eight years ago
1476481 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1476482 things are tough right now americans are uncertain about this housing crisis americans are uncertain about the economy as we see the stock market bounce up and down but more importantly the economy particularly in some parts of the country state of michigan governor romney and i campaigned not to my success i might add and other parts of the country are probably better off
1476483 but i think what were trying to do to fix this economy is important
1476484 weve got to address the housing subprime housing problem we need to obviously have this package go through the congress as quickly as possible we need to make the bush tax cuts permanent which i voted for twice to do so i think we need to eliminate the alternate minimum tax that sits out there and challenges 25 million american families
1476485 it sounds like that were not better off is what youre saying
1476486 i think we are better off overall if you look at the entire eight year period when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created the improvement in the economy et cetera
1476487 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1476488 gas prices have gone down and theyve gone down in part because the market is realizing that this kind of pressure from the congress may actually cause a change in american policy
1476489 then why are all the tv shows all of them talking about his being statistically tied and talking about that big 9 point lead evaporating
1476490 things are tough right now americans are uncertain about this housing crisis americans are uncertain about the economy as we see the stock market bounce up and down but more importantly the economy particularly in some parts of the country state of michigan governor romney and i campaigned not to my success i might add and other parts of the country are probably better off
1476491 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals

1476776 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1476777 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1476778 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1476779 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve
1476780 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1476781 i think the market is probably taking a little bit out of the tightening probabilities
1476782 i think the consensus is the fed will probably be at 2 percent for some time now
1476783 i think if anything the tilt of the fed announcement was a little bit more toward the weakness in the economy than most had expected that may have been the only surprise
1476784 that probably might have been part of the reassurance for the bond market
1476785 probably the best hope that everybody has is that oil and commodity prices will come down fast enough to take the pressure off inflation

1476793 were in a recession when has the fed ever raised rates in a recession
1476794 unemployment is headed toward 6 percent mortgage rates on home buyers are at 7 percent and these guys want to raise rates
1476795 were in an asset deflation of near historic proportions that calls for the use of the governments balance sheet and not for the federal reserve to raise interest rates
1476796 to the extent that the central banks now must prevent that deflation interest rates dont go up they go down
1476797 in the us 2 percent is pretty much the floor i think the fed made that clear
1476798 theyre going to provide liquidity in different forms and fashions
1476799 we want to stay under the umbrella to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters large banks and to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters the agencies fannie fnm and freddie fre thats where you want to be

1476805 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1476806 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach

1476837 frankly many divorcing parents dont handle the situation correctly and sadly act selfishly the innocent bystanders their children suffer the consequences which last long after the divorce
1476838 parents need to be more responsible in how they comport themselves during this tumultuous time from breaking this devastating news to their children to not badmouthing the ex in front of the children to simply allowing the child to love the other parent and shame on christie for making her children go through the public display of their fathers humiliation this may have made her feel vindicated but surely their children will be impacted forever
1476839 although many think divorce is not a big deal anymore because it is so common and socially acceptable the national child development study found otherwise children from disrupted families tend to do less well in school and subsequent careers than their peers they are also more likely to experience the break up of their own partnerships

1476842 why should singing different notes make people act differently that is a mysterious question and has not been adequately studied especially since scientists who study musicians tend to be musicians themselves and have all the peculiar complexes of tenors french horn players timpanists etc the fact remains that the four voice parts are easily distinguished i will now explain how the sopranos sing the highest and so they think they rule the world they have long hair fancier jewelry and swishier skirts and they consider themselves insulted if they are not allowed to go at least to a high f in every movement of any given piece when they reach a high note they hold it half again as long as the composer and or conductor requires and then complain that their throats are killing them and that the composer and conductor are sadists sopranos have varied attitudes toward the other choir sections though they consider all of them inferior altos are to sopranos rather like 2nd violins to 1st violins nice to harmonize but not really necessary all sopranos secretly feel that altos could drop out and the piece would sound essentially the same and they dont understand why anybody would sing in that range in the 1st place its so boring tenors on the other hand are nice to have around besides their flirtation possibilities it is a well known fact that sopranos never flirt with bases sopranos like to sing duets with tenors because the tenors are merely working very hard to sing in a low to medium soprano range while the sopranos are up there in the stratosphere showing off to sopranos basses are the scum of the earth they sing too darn loud and useless to tune to because theyre down in that low range and there has to be something wrong with anyone who sings in the f clef anyway although they swoon while the tenors sing they still end up going home with the basses altos are the salt of the earth in their opinion at least altos are unassuming people who would wear jeans to concerts if they were allowed altos are in a unique position in the choir in that they cant complain about singing very high or very low and they know that all the other sections think their parts are pitifully easy but the altos know otherwise they know that while the sopranos are screeching away on a high a they are executing elaborate passages full of sharps and flats and tricks of rhythm and nobody is noticing because the sopranos are singing too loud and the basses usually are too altos get a deep secret pleasure out conspiring together to tune the sopranos flat altos have an innate distrust of tenors because the tenors sing in almost the same range and think they sound better they like basses enjoy singing duets with them the basses just sound like a rumble anyway and its the only time the altos can really be heard altos other complaint is that there are always too many of them and they must never sing really loud tenors are spoiled thats all there is to it for one thing there are never enough of them and choir directors would rather sell their souls than let a halfway decent tenor quit while theyre always ready to unload a few altos at half price and then for some reason those few tenors are always really good its one of those annoying facts of life so it is no wonder that tenors get swollen heads after all who else can make sopranos swoon the one thing that can make tenors insecure is the accusation usually by the basses that anyone singing that high couldnt possibly be a real man in their usual perverse fashion the tenors never acknowledge this but just complain louder about the composer being a sadist and making them sing so darn high tenors have a love hate relationship with the conductor too because the conductor is always telling them to sing louder because there are so few of them no conductor in recorded history has ever asked for less tenor in a forte passage tenors feel threatened in some way by all the other sections the sopranos because they can hit those incredibly high notes the altos because they have not trouble singing the notes for which the tenors kill themselves and the basses because although they cant sing anything above an e they sing it loud enough to drown out the tenors of course the tenors would rather die than admit any of this it is a little known fact that tenors move their eyebrows more than anyone else while singing the basses sing the lowest of anybody this basically explains everything they are solid dependable people and have more facial hair than anyone the basses feel perpetually unappreciated but they have a deep conviction that they are actually the most important part a view endorsed by musicologists but certainly not by sopranos or tenors despite the fact that they have the most boring part and often sing the same or in endless fifths for an entire page they compensate for this by singing as loudly as they can get away with most basses are tuba players at heart basses are the only section that can regularly complain about their low part and they make horrible faces when trying the hit very low notes basses are charitable people but their charity does not extend to tenors whom they consider effete poseurs basses hate tuning with tenors more than anything basses like altos except when they have duets and the altos get the good part they cant imagine why anybody would ever want to sing that high and sound that bad when they make mistakes when a bass makes a mistake the other three parts cover him and he can continue on his merry way knowing that sometime somehow he will end up at the root of the chord sigmund freud says very curious i haff arrived at a totally different analysis of ze choir psyches vich iss below soprano its a tough job but only i can do it the meekest most frightened non singer in the world when drafted reluctantly into the sopranos stays meek up until the first few notes with the first warm up exercises a thought grows in her snivelling little mind that she and she alone has been destined for this job all her life at the end of the rehearsal the new personality will reveal itself i hope you girls could follow me ok sopranos are born and made to be the most competitive people in the choir by far and if they sing long enough become overly competitive in everything they pursue dont expect to finish a game of monopoly scrabble or golf with a soprano the only one that can beat her to the buffet queue is the bass man because the soprano was delayed adjusting her hair and make up at the end of the rehearsal alto comedian specialising in gallows humour the alto range creates a strange fatalism they know that in any disaster or catastrophe theyll be the only one to die or get paralysed consequently there is a constant quiet stream of one liners that the tenors could probably hear if the sopranos were not singing so loud she can be humourless and witless away from the choir but once in a group of her peers when there is breath to spare youre sure to catch a chuckle if you listen women who previously suffered severe pmt mood swings will find they totally disappear after three sessions in the altos tenor this is the biche niche i dont know if whining overly bossy big mouthed complainers are born and i cant believe that the cosmic effect of this part could possibly be so instantaneous but if you could get the dalai lama to sing in a choir stick him in the tenors for the first time and as all four parts come together hell turn around and yell at the sopranos to get in f g key the longer one sings tenor the more sophisticated and complex the bitching becomes changing from a crude verbal suggestion that everyone else is wrong to long winded level voiced reasoned treatises after every piece explaining why the choir is even worse now than last week ever wonder why when a conductor feels inclined to ask how the choir feels about a piece he says so how did you like that guys no not you tenors

1476871 our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1476872 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1476873 we were able to switch nicotines aversive effects to rewarding effects
1476874 if we can develop pharmacological treatments to target those regions we can basically affect the development of nicotine addiction by controlling the brains perception of nicotines rewarding effects

1476936 as i have to spend most of my day connected anyway ive generally used flights to sort through back work and e mails without the threat of being distracted by new work flooding in or as an opportunity to catch up on reading some dead tree material as such im somewhat ambivalent about the chance to have airborne wi fi
1476937 a lot of people secretly really value the absence of internet access during that time to read a book sleep be free of e mail or just have time to think

1476951 they will literally strip mine our company and our program of its identity
1476952 we also did a plan for the ndp ontario ndp were by they actually painted green shift on their bus last year because we essentially looked at from start to finish kind of what can they do to have a green campaign

1476973 the regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out fannie mae fnm n and freddie mac fre n the creditors of bear stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities they have swapped u s treasury bonds for toxic securities
1476974 it is privatizing the gains and profits and socializing the losses as usual this is socialism for wall street and the rich
1476975 in each one of these episodes the government bailed out the shareholders the bondholders and to some degree management
1476976 one problem with politicians is that when problems they create come to a head they typically feel this irresistible urge to do something rather than to un do something or to simply back off to avoid exacerbating the situation

1476983 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1476984 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1476985 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1476986 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1476987 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1476988 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1476993 one of the main causes of business failure today is no different from the main cause 5 or 10 years ago lack of adequate working capital to fuel the expansion experienced by many small businesses
1476994 this expansion is coming in the manufacturing sector but also much more noticeably in the service sector
1476995 the reason we did that was not to have an annual ball but having said that when we actually had the ball we realized people were very taken by the idea of having a veterans ball
1476996 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it

1477006 i dont see the taxpayers giving up the power to select their own watchdog my main concern is the question of an appointed auditor it is a bad idea we can have an independent elected auditor and we should it is just not right to have the same people in charge of the books in charge of the person who audits the books

1477012 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie
1477013 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth
1477014 even if he were acquitted of the charges that are before him he would still be considered an enemy combatant and therefore would continue to be subjected to continued detention
1477015 my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency said obama who spoke in berea ohio today about being in a town hall meeting the other day where he spelled out his energy plans and was asked what an individual can do

1477017 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun about a step which every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1477018 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true the democrat said
1477019 they need to do their homework because this is serious businss instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and acutally make a difference

1477028 no this does not mean that we accept all teachings of indian tradition as those of the church we are merely adapting them to christian teachings wherever we feel there are points of harmony
1477029 the move is welcome but it remains to be seen if its just another attempt to use indian symbols to spread christianity in areas like north india where the roots of culture run deep missionaries have often found it difficult to reach out to the masses with their philosophy
1477030 a selective approach is not proper accepting mirabai should mean accepting krishna and quoting from the upanishads should mean backing philosophies like advaita non duality is the church ready

1477094 as recently as last week the inability of congress to extend the solar investment tax credit at a time when american families are struggling with high energy prices and industries as diverse as autos and airlines are losing billions of dollars shows that this issue requires far more attention than it has received
1477095 our political leaders have been treating solar energy and other renewables as an interesting but sideline issue in fact the development of renewable energy sources is a vital economic priority of the united states we cannot afford to sit idly by as higher energy prices continue to shift wealth from american families and businesses to energy producers overseas we have the know how and ingenuity and are missing only the determination to build a new clean energy economy to power american prosperity

1477103 avem motive sa speram la un rating stabil pentru romania
1477104 ne asteptam la cel putin inca o crestere a dobanzii in conditiile in care ne temem ca sfarsitul de an ar putea aduce surprize negative legate de deficitul bugetar si de o posibila scadere a ratingului de tara

1477229 rookie running back mike hart ran and did everything in the preseason opener just about as hes done in practice rushing for times for 53 yards and catching three passes for 28 yards it really wasnt surprising when you watch him practice and watch him work we felt like hed have a good game he did everything he was called on to do he had two pass protection pickups he handled those well he caught the ball out of the backfield and ran and made people miss its probably what he has been doing for eight or nine years
1477230 we just watched some of the game film i thought those guys played well they were confident they knew what they were doing very few mistakes i dont think there were any mental errors physically youre going to get beat from time to time but i thought those guys played well and really met the challenge
1477231 our style is that way that guys have to learn to play a lot of positions
1477232 they fill in at different places and to see not only them play well but playing different spots we feel like we can count on them to be flexible and move around it was really a big plus coming out of sunday night
1477233 thats the way we all are you have to be interchangeable no matter what no matter if you play center for five years you have to be ready to go do guard however that works out
1477234 they still mess things up but one thing i like about them is theyre not hanging on the edge
1477235 when they dont do something right theyre not getting down and staying down that impedes progress they seem to be able to get rid of it and get on with life theyve made a lot of progress that way
1477236 you have to have backups who can come in no matter what

1477271 in the camp reprehensibly were found a number of smoke grenades they have been confiscated should be confiscated and the people that kept them should be prosecuted

1477289 ultimii ani sunt in mod clar unii dintre cei mai prolifici ai ultimului deceniu
1477290 mai mult de o treime din turistii care se indreapta pe litoral aleg mamaia unde petrec in medie cinci nopti si cheltuiesc in afara pachetului turistic circa 100 de lei zilnic
1477291 mamaia este ocupata in proportie de 100 in sezon chiar daca si statiunile din sud sunt din ce in ce mai cautate mamaia ramane pe primul loc in top iar majoritatea persoanelor se indreapta spre hoteluri de patru si cinci stele
1477292 principala destinatie de vacanta de pe litoralul romanesc ramane statiunea mamaia unde se poate constata o structurare foarte clara a cererii majoritatea solicitarilor vin pentru zilele de weekend mamaia fiind considerata o destinatie de clubbing in medie un turist cheltuieste peste 100 de lei pe zi in afara pachetului turistic
1477293 neptunul de exemplu s a ridicat foarte mult si ofera posibilitati de cazare si pentru gusturi mai rafinate
1477294 aproximativ 95 din locurile de cazare existente pe litoral sunt contracte prin intermediul tour operatorilor sunt foarte putin cei care aleg sa mearga pe cont propriu diferenta de 5 fiind in mare parte reprezentata de rezerva tehnica pe care si o asigura hotelurile
1477295 in cel mai bun caz anul aceasta se va inregistra o stagnare a cererii pentru vacantele pe litoral spun aceste lucruri bazandu ma pe trei factori foarte importanti anul acesta nu s a cheltuit nici macar un ban din partea ministerului pentru promovarea litoralului romanesc transportul din tara catre litoral este un dezastru iar explozia curselor charter fac mult mai atractive si accesibile destinatii mai interesante decat cele locale in loc sa faci 14 ore din cluj pana in constanta mai bine iei un charter si mergi in spania

1477303 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1477304 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1477305 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1477306 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1477307 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1477308 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1477309 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1477310 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1477311 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1477312 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1477313 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1477314 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities

1477323 the size of the infarct is one of the most important predictors of long term left ventricular function in patients with an acute myocardial infarction
1477324 imaging of myocardial infarct size is difficult in the emergency setting as the current gold standard methods of delayed enhanced mri and nuclear medicine techniques are difficult to perform in unstable patients ct is very easy and quick to perform even at the acute phase so we wanted to find out if it can do the same job as mri and potentially provide further information
1477325 powerful new tool for evaluating whether to cover individual consumers a health credit report drawn from databases containing prescription drug records on more than 200 million americans
1477326 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
1477327 taking place largely outside the scrutiny of federal health regulators and law makers
1477328 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1477329 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all if this works is disturbing
1477330 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
1477331 instead we should look ahead to consider all of the possible outcomes of these trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and safely as possible if it is proven effective
1477332 cannot shy away from discussing issues such as potential drug resistance the difficulty of adhering to a once a day pill regimen for people who are hiv negative or the cost of providing prep
1477333 he told me he had some bad news and i thought one of my horses was dead
1477334 he told me and it didnt really seem like a big deal until an hour later when i thought oh damn and other words
1477335 usually in the movies they say give me the money but they tried to kill us from the very start it happened really fast they ran in holding the knife out and started trying to chop me
1477336 we would never have used the gun if they werent so threatening they were frantic
1477337 i got a kick out of my mii because it looks like he has a lot of fun on the pitch and hes capable of pulling off some wild moves
1477338 its fun to take control of my character and blast outrageous shots on goal with a flick of the wrist ive never played soccer like this before
1477339 it will lead to what will appear like an uprising against the palestinian authority in the west bank
1477340 if arrests continue they will lead to unplanned for responses whether from resistance fighters or the people

1477356 the american civil liberties union obtained documents today from the department of defense confirming the militarys use of unlawful interrogation methods on detainees held in u

1477364 the intelligent expansion of our intellectual property practice in atlanta washington d c and elsewhere is of paramount strategic importance to our firm and to our clients
1477365 the additions of jennifer jim ping and chris are key first steps in this expansion
1477366 the addition of jennifer helps round out our already strong electrical telecommunication internet and software patent practice and gives us the opportunity to expand our intellectual property services and offerings nationally and internationally
1477367 jims superlative academic background and international connections in both europe and china will enable him to fit perfectly into our international green and intellectual property practices

1477375 we can all be proud of by the end of this year
1477376 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1477377 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1477378 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1477379 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1477380 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders

1477383 over the last two months the notion that barack obama cant win enough support from white working class voters has been a key point of debate in the democratic presidential race
1477384 i think democrats do have questions about whether or not obama is going to be able to reach out and successfully win over the kind of blue collar voters that democrats need to win in order to take the white house back in november
1477385 now the difficult part comes making sure the next conservative government is actually conservative taking our country back from brussels cutting taxes when possible ending the bullying bossy nanny state providing decently for our armed forces theres no point in a 300 seat tory mejority if all we do is ape new labour
1477386 two mistakes we make about boris the first is that because he says
1477387 the liberation of iraq in other words the decision that we had to move the iraqi people and the region into a post saddam era will stand im convinced as one of the greatest decisions of american statecraft as one of the things that american soldiers male and female the politicians who voted for it those whove defended it will be proudest of in the future of any decision weve ever made
1477388 this will be no war there will be a fairly brief and ruthless military intervention the president will give an order the attack will be rapid accurate and dazzling it will be greeted by the majority of the iraqi people as an emancipation and i say bring it on
1477389 a continued west northwest motion with some reduction in forward speed is expected over the next day or two taking edouard across central texas
1477390 we have a lot of wind and rain right now
1477391 of course we always feel very fortunate when we dont get a direct hit
1477392 galveston is used to tropical storms fortunately this did not become a hurricane
1477393 no matter how paranoid or conspiracy minded you are what the government is actually doing is worse than you imagine
1477394 were going to stay in iraq to get the job done as long as the government wants us there
1477395 said his government was impatiently waiting for the complete withdrawal of u
1477396 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
1477397 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
1477398 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
1477399 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
1477400 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
1477401 when they got close she hid her head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1477402 this is a problem up and down the coast particularly on docks
1477403 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1477404 hed just turn his nose up to the sun and just look at us like im here so what it was just the darndest thing
1477405 ive never seen anything so preposterous and ive been sailing for years and years
1477406 my grandson was more than willing to give up his bathtub if we could take the sea lion home
1477407 if there is a significant increase a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants a second repository may be needed
1477408 but you have to say compared to what the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1477409 all youre doing is pushing the whole problem out into the future and significantly increasing the cost
1477410 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1477411 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1477412 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1477413 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1477414 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1477415 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1477416 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1477417 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1477418 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1477419 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1477420 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1477421 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1477422 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1477423 thats not giving him mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1477424 its about time i get whats owed to me from the situation i was stuck in
1477425 its unfortunate things have turned out the way they did but artists deserve to be compensated fairly by their labels for the work they do and that wasnt happenin in my case im happy to finally be a free man and make a new start
1477426 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1477427 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1477428 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1477429 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them
1477430 while not precisely correct its a good enough generalization for an american audience not really listening anyway obamas remarks were not in the least controversial and just plain boring in terms of content certainly not newsworthy
1477431 since 9 11 our principal export to the world has been our fear
1477432 i guess people are hoping that maybe this other person lindsay is going to show up but until then were stuck with these horrific people
1477433 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1477434 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1477435 we did some rehearsals but then i found out it was six days a week for a couple of months
1477436 photographers moved into apartments next door to us and we really found ourselves kind of living like a spy movie i feel like they think they have to be there like they punch in or something
1477437 morgan is doing well after his surgery last night to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand
1477438 the surgery last night lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days
1477439 theyre about four months into the pregnancy shes thrilled angie cant wait to flaunt her bump
1477440 i had dinner on the beach with a crush and there were lights on the palm trees then went walking on the beach and after that we slow danced wait it gets better
1477441 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1477442 we bust into hysterics my sister had made a joke about twins literally the night before because my grandparents and sis both had twins angie was on the table during the sonogram and we were in hysterics we didnt see this one coming
1477443 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle
1477444 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
1477445 at first i was frightened of being overwhelmed by all those old feelings there was a big part of me that didnt want to be reminded of who i was back then but then i started to feel that maybe this was something i had to do
1477446 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1477447 this isnt about foley being gay its not about what the kids did its about an adult male or female straight or gay taking sexual advantage of children and other adults protecting that adult
1477448 its outrageous its shocking but it shouldnt be totally surprising when we hold up tolerance and diversity as the guidepost for public life this is what you end up getting
1477449 theres about 38 i think that actually applied for it and 12 of us were chosen
1477450 we projected that if we sold all of the ones that we print we should raise between around 85 000
1477451 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1477452 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1477453 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1477454 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1477455 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1477456 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1477457 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning
1477458 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1477459 in luna iunie s au inregistrat cresteri ale castigului salarial fata de luna precedenta ca urmare a acordarii de prime inclusiv prime de vacanta pentru functionarii publici si prime de stabilitate pentru personalul contractual din unitatile sanitare publice si a realizarilor de productie mai mari
1477460 ben has demonstrated that he has an in depth understanding of the cedia space as well as a clear track record of growing revenues
1477461 we liked bens nearly 30 years of hands on sales experience tied to everything from small start up companies to large scale operations
1477462 i am thrilled and very excited to become a part of the savant organization
1477463 their innovative and unique approach to system automation and a v signal routing distribution offers significant value and opportunity in both the residential market as well as a host of commercial applications
1477464 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1477465 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1477466 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1477467 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1477468 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1477469 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1477470 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1477471 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1477472 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1477473 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1477474 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1477475 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1477476 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1477477 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1477478 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1477479 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1477480 i t is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true
1477481 i think dicker and mcmanus are the problems they are bayh tells the
1477482 absolving itself of any responsibility to the nuclear reactor fleet it now owns
1477483 i would want to buy books because i loved to read and ive always loved to read but of course she wouldnt take my money
1477484 im still enjoying reading but sometimes i have to read as much as i can so i can be on top of all thats out there
1477485 the good thing is the childrens picture books arent very long
1477486 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning
1477487 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1477488 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1477489 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1477490 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1477491 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1477492 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1477493 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1477494 dont be afraid to let your voice crack and let things happen
1477495 its always difficult to explain what went wrong we just didnt play well it was an extremely poor performance
1477496 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we didnt reach any sort of level
1477497 it was one of those games where you never felt comfortable at all
1477498 it seems ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out in the first game of the next season but thats whats happened
1477499 everyone who was involved is extremely disappointed weve got no excuses
1477500 kaunas were still well in the game at ibrox tonight we had opportunities not very many but we had a few we gave away needless free kicks and corners
1477501 if it had been a situation where we were a new team that had been put together then fine youd say thats something that could be expected to happen but were a reasonably experienced team
1477502 if im not interested in what you have to say i wont watch it read it and hear it im not a hostage any longer
1477503 when our pilot and our spotter went over it our spotter started trembling because hed never seen anything like it
1477504 this is a trend currently ongoing on the west coast and it seems to be moving in our direction
1477505 the mexican organizations are actually coming here and establishing these plots large plots
1477506 there was a plastic covered kitchen area and two areas they established as sleeping quarters
1477507 had their food water and supplies kept all right there
1477508 weve taken quite a quantity out of perry county that could end up in the hands of kids in your neighborhoods
1477509 im so sick and tired of getting bit over my entire body
1477510 theyre all on my neck and biting me on my arms
1477511 my arms feel like im reading braille theyre so bumpy
1477512 i have to leave all my furniture behind it will infest my new place
1477513 they changed the carpets and the bugs are still crawling around everything all over the floor
1477514 theyre in the tvs in the clothes theyre in everything now i have to throw everything away and start all over again
1477515 one of the apartment industrys biggest fears is for a tenant to bring bed bugs into the community because it can entail such a lengthy and extensive treatment program
1477516 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio workers makes in a year
1477517 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1477518 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1477519 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1477520 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1477521 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1477522 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1477523 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1477524 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1477525 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties
1477526 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1477527 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1477528 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1477529 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1477530 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1477531 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1477532 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
1477533 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
1477534 death be not proud though some have called thee mighty and dreadful for thou art not so for those whom thou thinkst thou dost overthrow die not poor death nor yet canst thou kill me from rest and sleep which but thy pictures be much pleasure then from thee much more must flow and soonest our best men with thee do go rest of their bones and souls delivery thou art slave to fate chance kings and desperate men and dost with poison war and sickness dwell and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well and better than thy stroke why swellst thou then one short sleep past we wake eternally and death shall be no more death thou shalt die
1477535 por que ser que una pel cula en la que act a morgan freeman siempre suena bien por ejemplo torrente 3 con morgan freeman y ya parece m s interesante
1477536 as de menores y sus supuestos intelectuales no pasan de tres temas racismo inclusi n ddhh que repiten cual papagayos pero sin la mayor originalidad creativa para resolverlos
1477537 no creo que sea lo mismo una cl nica en la molina que el hospital del ni o o el mar a auxiliadora por decir algo
1477538 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1477539 they couldnt have picked a worse time to get into the automobile business domestically
1477540 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
1477541 the impatient money has become even more impatient and cerberus is an impatient money company how long can they tolerate negative cash flow
1477542 i wish i could be more optimistic but i dont see any daylight here
1477543 i doubt seriously as an outsider that they were planning a quick spin here
1477544 it may be that they sold chrysler as possibly the best moment they could for their own health
1477545 we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon

1477571 in the light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high

1477582 avem motive sa speram la un rating stabil pentru romania
1477583 ne asteptam la cel putin inca o crestere a dobanzii in conditiile in care ne temem ca sfarsitul de an ar putea aduce surprize negative legate de deficitul bugetar si de o posibila scadere a ratingului de tara
1477584 ar fi prea mult cu exceptia cazului in care ar surveni o deteriorare a indicatorilor macroeconomici ceea ce nu intra in prognozele actuale fiind de asteptat eventual o intarziere a diminuarii dezechilibrelor
1477585 exista si posiblitatea sa nu mai apara majorari de dobanda odata ce bnr realizeaza ca a supraestimat nivelul inflatiei la sfarsit de an
1477586 dupa recenta majorare a dobanzii si mai ales daca vor urma si altele probabil ca vor fi presiuni de apreciere nesustenabila a leului in conditiile in care bancile centrale din regiune nu au mai crescut dobanzile si sunt deja asteptari ca vor incepe sa le scada deja sentimentul nerezidentilor fata de leu s a imbunatatit incepand deja sa apara rapoarte in care nerezidentii vad apreciere pe leu dupa ce cu catva timp in urma vedeau deprecieri importante iar asteptarile pentru noi cresteri de dobanzi au crescut
1477587 motivele pentru care am initiat actiunea in instanta sunt urmatoarele tariful nejustificat de scazut al acestei licente comparativ cu alte licente si ingradirea dreptului nostru de a participa la licitatie astfel se ajunge in situatia in care noul competitor va beneficia de conditii mai bune decat ceilalti jucatori de pe piata locala
1477588 estimam ca piata va continua sa creasca din punctul de vedere al volumului de oferte iar

1477590 suntem constienti ca pretul otelului si al altor materiale au crescut dar firmele de constructii au preturi nerealiste care mananca din profiturile dezvoltatorilor ofertele pe care le am primit in prima faza au fost cu 30 50 mai mari fata de ce ne asteptam am organizat o noua runda de negocieri si speram ca in octombrie sa incepem lucrarile cu una din cele trei firme de constructii cu care suntem in discutii proiectul a fost intarziat cam jumatate de an
1477591 semnalele ca o serie de proiecte din afara bucurestiului nu au succesul scontat au determinat o serie de retaileri sa si reconsidere politica de expansiune pot spune ca nu dormeam foarte bine pana am ajuns ca la arad sa avem contracte semnate pentru mai mult de 50 din suprafata mallului cu ancore puternice precum cinema city sau billa
1477592 ne este destul de greu sa inaintam cu cele patru proiecte in acelasi timp si a trebuit sa acordam mai multa atentie proiectelor din arad si cluj unde avem competitie puternica astfel ca proiectul de la satu mare este putin in urma
1477593 am fost preocupati deoarece numele nostru a fost asociat cu acest scandal de insolventa astfel ca in primele zile a trebuit sa ne contactam toti partenerii pentru a lamuri situatia pot spune ca am depasit cu bine momentul astfel ca cine a avut de semnat contracte cu noi a semnat in ceea ce priveste relatia cu bancile consider ca pentru o institutie profesionista este usor de inteles ca problemele dawnay day group nu ne afecteaza activitatea

1477672 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1477673 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1477674 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1477675 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1477676 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions

1477742 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1477743 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1477744 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1477745 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1477746 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1477747 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1477748 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1477749 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1477750 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

1477752 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

1477754 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1477755 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1477756 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1477757 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1477758 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1477759 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1477760 oh mickey youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind hey mickey
1477761 what um i asked when did it become evident to you that you were being given the opportunity to influence and change the lives of others in such an impactful way
1477762 well i am referring to your rise in media and stature as one of the most influential persons over the last few decades
1477763 clearly you misunderstand my questions and reasons for being here
1477764 perhaps its your misunderstanding that has brought you here for nothing has been afforded to me that is not already available to you where i may have a visible opportunityo reach a mass you have such opportunity yourself to reach those around you to be a voice of change a voice of love and of hope for who knows the paths of those you cross and how the chain reaction can occur do not despise who or what you are for you are given the same as i but the question is what are you doing with it
1477765 you are right its not the same that you question greatness when all you need for greatness is already within you do not call greatness notoriety nor should you attach it to a bank account nor to a visible abilty greatness is what calls you inside to do something different something right something impactful it is what causes you to pay for someone elses meal in a drive thru it is what causes you to go the extra mile for a friend in need greatness is within each of us so when did you decide you were not purposed for greatness have you determined that mediocrity is your standard have you decided that living today is just a means of getting to tomorrow you must choose to accept the responsibility of greatness
1477766 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1477767 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1477768 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1477769 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1477770 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1477771 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1477772 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1477773 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1477774 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1477775 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1477776 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1477777 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1477778 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1477779 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1477780 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1477781 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1477782 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1477783 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1477784 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1477785 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1477786 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1477787 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1477788 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1477789 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1477790 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1477791 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1477792 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1477793 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1477794 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1477795 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1477796 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1477797 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1477798 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1477799 marion and joys lives are endangered there are those who are seeking to kill americans in pakistan contact their host and get them out of the country
1477800 so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
1477801 and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces
1477802 as you come to him the living stone rejected by men but chosen by god and precious to him you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ for in scripture it says see i lay a stone in zion a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame now to you who believe this stone is precious but to those who do not believe the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone and a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall they stumble because they disobey the message which is also what they were destined for but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to god that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light
1477803 jacob took a stone and put it under his head and lay down to sleep
1477804 i am the lord the god of your father abraham and the god of isaac i will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying your descendants will be like the dust of the earth and you will spread out to the west and to the east to the north and to the south all peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring i am with you and will watch over you wherever you go and i will bring you back full cycle to this land i will not leave you until i have done what i have promised you
1477805 surely the lord is in this place and i was not aware of it
1477806 how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of god this is the gate of heaven
1477807 you o king saw a messenger a holy one coming down from heaven and saying cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump bound with iron and bronze in the grass of the field while its roots remain in the ground let him be drenched with the dew of heaven let him live like the wild animals until seven times pass by until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes
1477808 therefore i am now going to allure her will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her
1477809 but the land you are crossing the to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven it is a land the lord your god cares for the eyes of the lord your god are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end so if you faithfully obey the commands i am giving you today to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul then i will send rain on your land in its season both autumn and spring rains so that you may gather in your grain new wine and oil
1477810 new birth of teachers abounding in spiritual strength enabling man to transcend physical limitations
1477811 for in christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form and you have been given fullness in christ who is the head over every power and authority in him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead
1477812 there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known
1477813 you will pray to him and he will hear you and you will fulfill your vows what you decide on will be done and light will shine on your ways when men are brought low and you say lift them up then he will save the downcast he will deliver even one who is not innocent who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands
1477814 now therefore i pray if i have found grace in your sight show me now your way that i may know you and that i may find grace in your sight and consider that this nation is your people
1477815 hear now my words if there is a prophet among you i the lord make myself known to him in a vision i speak to him in a dream not so with my servant moses he is faithful in all my house i speak with him face to face even plainly and not in dark sayings and he sees the form of the lord
1477816 if you hear my words and do them you will be like a person built upon a rock all the epistles are built upon what jesus taught we remember things that are important to us and the things we value are easy for us to learn and appropriate in our lives learning to hear the voice of the lord is vital for our lives to be fulfilled happy and successful the bible tells us our treasure resides where our heart resides where is your heart what is your number one priority or desire in life revelation 2 11 he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church we have two ears we have the equipment but do we have the desire and the dedication to develop our spiritual abilities to hear gods voice in the spirit realm solomon sought after god with his whole heart and made great sacrifices god visited him in his dream and told him to ask what he willed and it would be granted unto him he asked for godly wisdom and to be able to hear the voice of the lord 1 kings 3 9 therefore give to your servant an understanding heart to judge your people that i may discern between good and evil for who is able to judge this great people of yours
1477817 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen
1477818 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater so is it will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
1477819 i tell you the truth if anyone says to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and does not
1477820 concerning the works of men by the word of your lips i have kept away from the paths of the destroyer uphold my steps in your paths that my footsteps may not slip
1477821 sons of god we can sense what god wants to do in a meeting and we can speak it into existence god sent his word and healed them once our hearts open and receive the spoken word of knowledge an image is formed that we must guard with our words faith and actions for if they did not escape who refused him who spoke on earth much more shall we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from heaven have an open heart or a listening ear to receive by faith from the lord what we think imagine see and speak creates the world around us as i have thought so it shall come to pass and as i have purposed so it shall stand
1477822 god please send your rain to still the dust storms and cool the atmosphere
1477823 omg why isnt he texting is he cheating omg omg

1477825 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1477826 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1477827 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1477828 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1477829 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

1477835 submit to god and be at peace with him in this way prosperity will come to you accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart
1477836 you will make your prayer to him he will hear you and you will pay your vows you will also declare a thing and it will be established for you so light will shine on your ways when they cast you down and you say exaltation will come then he will save the humble person
1477837 decree a thing and it will be established for you
1477838 if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will arise from another place but you and your fathers family will perish and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this
1477839 because haman attacked the jews i have given his estate to esther and they have hanged him on the gallows proverbs13 22 says the wealth of the wicked will be transferred to the righteous
1477840 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom all who follow his precepts have good understanding to him belongs eternal praise
1477841 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he jesus was with god in the beginning
1477842 this is the message you heard from the beginning we should love one another
1477843 teach me your way o lord lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors do not turn me over to the desire of my foes for false witnesses rise up against me breathing out violence i am still confident of this i will see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living
1477844 fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds love the lord your god teach them to your children talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the lord swore to give your forefathers as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth
1477845 behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and dine with him and he with me to him who overcomes i will grant to sit with me on my throne as i also overcame and sat down with my father on his throne he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches
1477846 direct me in the path of your commands for there i find delight turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain turn my eyes away from worthless things preserve my life according to your word
1477847 teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom
1477848 you are the christ the son of the living god
1477849 blessed are you simon son of jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my father in heaven and i tell you that you are peter and on this rock of revelation i will build my church and the gates of hades will not overcome it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
1477850 he is the christ the first born son of the living god
1477851 they may be ever seeing but never perceiving and ever hearing but never understanding otherwise they might turn and be forgiven
1477852 i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people
1477853 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch to attach oneself to make implied relations no unclean thing and i will receive you
1477854 i will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty
1477855 why does this fellow talk like that hes blaspheming who can forgive sins but god alone
1477856 why are you thinking these things which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say get up take your mat and walk but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins
1477857 i tell you get up take your mat and go home
1477858 my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirits power so that your faith might not rest on mens wisdom but on gods power
1477859 once having been asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come jesus replied
1477860 where can i go from your spirit where can i flee from your presence if i go up to the heavens you are there if i make my bed in the depths you are there if i rise on the wings of the dawn if i settle on the far side of the sea even there your hand will guide me your right hand will hold me fast
1477861 the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart
1477862 whoever believes on him will not be put to shame
1477863 whoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved
1477864 since you are under the same sentence the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom we are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve but this man has done nothing wrong
1477865 i tell you the truth today you will be with me in paradise
1477866 not long after that the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living
1477867 when he came to his senses he said how many of my fathers hired men have food to spare and here i am starving to death
1477868 but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him
1477869 the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you
1477870 the older brother became angry and refused to go in
1477871 my son the father said you are always with me and everything i have is yours inherited the kingdom
1477872 is this the one you say was born blind how is it that now he can see
1477873 and we know he was born blind but how he can see now or who opened his eyes we dont know ask him he is of age he will speak for himself
1477874 whether he is a sinner or not i dont know one thing i do know i was blind but now i see
1477875 you have now seen him in fact he is the one speaking with you
1477876 for judgment i have come into this world so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind
1477877 if you were blind you would not be guilty of sin but now that you claim you can see your guilt remains
1477878 when a man believes in me he does not believe in me only but in the one who sent me
1477879 as for the person who hears my words but does not keep them i do not judge him for i did not come to judge the world but to save it there is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words that very word which i spoke will condemn him at the last day for i did not speak of my own accord but the father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it i know that his command leads to eternal life so whatever i say is just what the father has told me to say
1477880 do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you
1477881 do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven give and it will be given to you a good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap for with the measure you use it will be measured to you
1477882 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
1477883 no good tree bears bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit each tree is recognized by its own fruit people do not pick figs from thorn bushes or grapes from briers the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks god is preparing us to rule and reign with him forever god uses the trails tests disappointments sorrows grief and painful failures in life he stretches us to the breaking point time and time again so we are able to hold more of his essence and overcoming power god uses pressure to cause us to expand and be strengthened spiritual opposition enables us to learn to defeat the enemy through different warfare tactics the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they are might through the spirit of god we are called to stand up and fight and take the kingdom by force those that do not learn to war in the spirit and to use their spiritual weapons will not make it through the calamites and diseases that are coming on the earth we must learn to walk in the fullness of what god has given us when jesus returns 2 3 of the earths population has perished the ones who are still standing are the bride of christ who has been perfected and made herself ready we are to be preparing our mind heart soul and spirit for the end times revelation 19 7 9 let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory for the wedding of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready fine linen bright and clean was given her to wear
1477884 write blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the lamb
1477885 he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust
1477886 i will rescue him i will protect him for he acknowledges my name he will call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation
1477887 this land that was laid waste has become like the garden of eden the cities that were lying in ruins desolate and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited
1477888 the reason the joker worked is because hes insane and batman is also crazy you need someone who is more than evil anyone who saw tommy lee jones as the cackling lunatic knows that
1477889 ideally you want another movie with heath without him catwoman but really think that one through give her a new take
1477890 catwoman needs to be part of it thats even more obvious now that hes living on the other side of life
1477891 it would be fun to see them put a spin on a less obvious one like they did with ras al ghul
1477892 catwoman s such a powerful and sexual and strong woman and i like that but god i hope not as frank millers version of her as a prostitute thats the worst part of year one thats just frank trying to be outrageous it didnt ring remotely true to me
1477893 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies
1477894 theres a great story to be told of the triangle between bruce batman and selena catwoman i love writing her she plays with him like a ball of yarn shes the only one that makes him all rigid when he talks to her
1477895 i would pick the calendar man julian gregory day long halloween and dark victory happen to be my favorite collections hes not an iconic character but he means a lot to me im called the calender man on the coheed and cambria tour bus because im always on time but hes more like a hannibal lector figure
1477896 at one point batman had a therapist hugo strange who was actually a great villain
1477897 when hugo strange found out about batmans identity through analysis he drugs him and takes over his identity
1477898 unless maybe he just has a skin condition it would be weird though riddler could work as well
1477899 characters like catwoman riddler and hugo strange make sense because theyre counterpoints to batmans psychosis and fears the joker creates chaos two face shows the duality of the batman bruce wayne relationship and how batmans found peace with that duality batman searches for answers and the riddler has questions batman is driven and catwoman is sexual they play well against each other and challenge aspects of what makes a hero

1477916 is any one of you sick he should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the lord 15 and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the lord will raise him up if he has sinned he will be forgiven
1477917 confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed
1477918 the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective

1478038 my understanding is that a fine can be issued for constructing without a permit i feel the fine should be issued to shaw and paid you as council members will be doing the village a great injustice if this fine is allowed to go unpaid
1478039 the mayor is incapable of performing his duties and appears he would rather beg for forgiveness than ask for permission

1478064 whether this movement is going to maintain the viability of the insurance reserve pool is another question
1478065 its not clear to me exactly what they are going to do or which part of that market they are going to take
1478066 i dont know how it s affected the business but its clear that it will have some impact
1478067 than the movie sales might suggest but it didn t do as well as our expectations

1478162 bradley is a very exciting player and were delighted that he is joining saracens hes a talented footballer who can control games but he also has a physical edge to his game as his powerful displays for the sharks in their super 14 and currie cup campaigns have shown
1478163 having spoken at length to bradley i know he is looking forward to working with the coaching team at saracens to help in the development of his game and also broaden his rugby knowledge
1478164 i wouldnt consider another option in south africa the sharks is my home where i grew up but this is a unique opportunity as a young guy to broaden my horizons
1478165 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1478166 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1478167 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1478168 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1478169 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1478170 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1478171 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1478172 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1478173 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1478174 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1478201 ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s
1478202 nobody is term limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress i believe in one form of term limits theyre called elections
1478203 so if you think its a good idea for the motherhood and apple pie society to utilize banners hanging from poles and the following week the american nazi party comes in and says you know wed like to hang some banners in a similar way you would absolutely be required to allow the nazi party to hang swastikas off the telephone poles
1478204 its a battle we fight in one form or another all the time

1478235 we have parted ways with long term drummer dan smith due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live we took the decision to replace him with good friend lyn jeffs who also drums in label partners ingested hes a sick drummer and is going to take annotations of an autopsy to a whole new level see him in action at the summer slaughter uk tour
1478236 from what weve written so far its a big progression from 2008s before the throne of infection in technicality heaviness speed and structure we feel this is what weve been working up to and this album will depict us to a tee weve taken a more old school death approach to writing mixed with our current sound because it just feels right there are a lot more solos lead parts more blasts heavier slams and all the other clich this is gonna be amazing lines bands drop when theyre promoting a new cd even if no one else likes what weve written were the most happiest weve been with our output weve locked ourselves away in a room and just written what has come naturally its taken a lot of influence from bands we worship aka nile decapitated hate eternal devourment deicide and has a concept that follows on from where before the throne left off
1478237 after the oct 5 2001 death from anthrax exposure of sun photo editor robert stevens mueller was beaten up during president bushs morning intelligence briefings for not producing proof the killer spores were the handiwork of terrorist mastermind osama bin laden according to a former aide
1478238 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1478239 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1478240 couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
1478241 special electro static treatment this is superweapons grade anthrax that even the united states government in its openly proclaimed programs had never developed before so it was obvious to me that this was from a u s government lab
1478242 after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the bush administration tried to ram the usa patriot act through congress
1478243 senators tom daschle d south dakota and patrick leahy d vermont were holding it up because they realized what this would lead to the first draft of the patriot act would have suspended the writ of habeas corpus which protects citizens from unlawful imprisonment and guarantees due process of law then all of a sudden out of nowhere come these anthrax attacks
1478244 investigators had an array of indirect evidence that they argue strongly implicates dr ivins in the attacks
1478245 that evidence includes tracing the prestamped envelopes used in the attacks to stock sold in three maryland post offices including one in frederick frequented by dr ivins who had long rented a post office box there under an assumed name the source said the evidence also includes records of the scientists extensive after hours use of his lab at the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases around the time the letters were mailed the source said
1478246 might be made public as early as wednesday if the bureau could persuade a federal judge to unseal the evidence and if agents could brief survivors of the anthrax attacks and family members of those who died

1478251 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1478252 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1478253 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1478254 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1478255 when i get to a point where my best is not good enough any more as i prepare and i practice and i get ready and i know if i go out there and play the way i know i can play and its just not good enough any more my skills have diminished that far its time for me to move on rack the cue and go home
1478256 in an individual sport when your skills have diminished you have no one for backup
1478257 thats one of the reasons why i truly admire what tennis player pete sampras did he won the u s open and he was done

1478259 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1478260 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1478261 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1478262 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1478263 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1478264 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1478265 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1478266 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1478267 the reason for this stop is talking on a cell phone
1478268 i did not have my seat belt on i am guilty
1478269 i am going to fight it its 25 bucks its the principle if i didnt swerve around the bus i wouldve been cremated

1478276 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes

1478279 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong

1478286 while we have seen very little benefit from these prices thus far in 2008 due to lower priced contracts that were signed in 2006 and 2007 we believe that our shareholders will begin to see the benefits during the remaining months of 2008 and a much greater benefit beginning in early 2009
1478287 the market has finally begun to turn in a positive direction the single biggest issue that we have faced during the past several years has been pressure on profit margins this pressure has been due to extremely low coal prices and rapidly rising costs particularly in underground mining due to changes in the safety and regulatory environment

1478330 the timing of the release shows this was not an independent investigation because an independent watchdog would not choose friday at 6 p m to release a report
1478331 the department has nothing further to add after the ministers statement and making the report and summary of actions public
1478332 this is not my preferred method to roll anything out
1478333 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which we are not only not hiding but scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
1478334 after they let me retire now im supposed to play for them it doesnt make any sense
1478335 the only fair thing is for them to let me out of the very generous contract i signed under my own free will to go play for one of their hated rivals

1478345 photography is one of the digital activities that is really pervasive along with music and video
1478346 its something that you see old and young males and females taking part in a very broad demographic base engages in digital photography and to that end any tool that can give casual users some interim steps so that you dont have to choose professional photography i think thats smart

1478412 when i look back i cant recall anything that would have been a threat to anyone to think that we were being watched its a surprise
1478413 i dont think they had a reason to be following what we were doing unless they were on to something else i dont know about
1478414 if you wanted to see a bunch of women sitting around talking about issues and going on demonstrations are that are peaceful and non violent then so be it but i dont think there was a reason to do that
1478415 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have
1478416 i think there had to be a lot of fear back then when you would see women get together to discuss these issues and maybe a lack of understanding comes to mind about what it was all about
1478417 all of those songs would have been sung at rallies demonstrations or meetings that we attended

1478463 the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition
1478464 open competition is too costly to contemplate and is likely to lead to the breakdown of our public services and no effective middle course appears possible without subsidies the complete coordination of transport by means of a scheme of unification is the only way to get the best possible service at the lowest economic cost
1478465 one of the main follies of nationalisation from the socialist point of view was that the previous owners of the industries were fully compensated for being dispossessed of their shares by being given equivalent amounts in guilt edged stock as a result the capitalist classes were no poorer than they had been before in many cases they were enriched because their assets had been sunk in declining concerns instead of furthering the socialist objective of greater equality all that happened was that the state acquired large amounts of often run down assets at an inflated cost

1478470 there are two main arguments from a labour point of view against the representative idea the first is that a board appointed on grounds of ability is likely to be far more efficient and socialists above all must keep the communal interest to the fore members appointed by particular interests would naturally tend to concentrate primarily on pleasing those interests rather than concerned without fear or favour with the general efficiency of the undertaking their control or influence by such interest might be injurious to a proper corporate spirit and would diminish the very necessary responsibility to the public as a whole nor does the appointment of members selected in a representative capacity and not primarily or mainly for their personal ability appear likely to result in the most efficient board for a task which is complex and highly responsible for it is vital to socialism that national ownership should show itself superior to private enterprise in all round efficiency emphasis in the original
1478471 i now fear that the combination of the fragility of the financial system with the huge rewards it generates for insiders will destroy something even more important here the political legitimacy of the market economy itself

1478588 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result

1478600 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1478601 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1478602 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1478603 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1478604 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1478605 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1478606 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1478607 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1478608 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1478609 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1478610 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1478611 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1478612 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1478613 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1478614 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1478615 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature

1478623 there are many theories as to what rock art carvings mean
1478624 they may have played a role in fire feastings and offering activities or been used as signposts or to mark territory
1478625 they may have a spiritual significance in hunter gatherer communities those places where mountains touch the sky or the sea reaches the shore are often considered the domain of supernatural ancestors most rock art is found in those areas

1478630 the online record of the northumberland and durham examples will serve as the starting point for a national survey and we hope help us understand their meaning and lead to the discovery of others

1478648 a superficial tale spun on the purported comments of a collection of anonymous former employees and unspecified others likely including the well worn band of ideologues and self interested detractors who have opposed the gse model for years

1478650 as we told the reporter while our ceo and senior management team wanted to raise that capital quickly our own internal and external legal counsel counsel to the board and our bankers and counsel to our bankers advised us of the significant risk of commencing a public offering due to the timing of the second quarter release and until after we completed our registration with the sec which we have since done

1478681 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1478682 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1478683 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1478684 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1478685 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1478686 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1478687 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1478688 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1478689 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1478690 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1478691 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1478692 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1478693 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1478694 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1478695 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1478696 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1478722 it would be pointless to sit here and be mad over things i cant control
1478723 he pitched his way onto the team in 2007 giving us an opportunity to acclimate him to the majors in a relief role and at the start of this season we thought his greatest value to the team in 2008 was in the bullpen
1478724 however as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 offseason preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development
1478725 ever since then clearly he wouldnt have gone out there at all during a lightning storm he knows firsthand that lightning is nothing to play around with
1478726 that last bolt could not have been more than half a mile away
1478727 it was right on top of us thats way too close to be fooling around they did the right thing and pulled us off the field
1478728 the lightning in my opinion even though it lit up the skies it was deep and away from the ballpark
1478729 i had talked to the groundskeeper several times about the weather and he said there were possible storms coming in i was concerned about the lightning
1478730 im not trying to put it on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that
1478731 but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1478732 weve got to keep some perspective here this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that at the same time dont lose your mind youve got tornado sirens going off and severe weather all over the place theres no reason for it theres no reason to put fans at risk theres no reason for the players to be at risk
1478733 the ones that kill people you dont wait for the thing to hit the field before you say well theres lightning in the area
1478734 if lightning is striking all around i dont care if it says its 10 miles away on the radar it can hit like that
1478735 if we were down 2 0 i would say the same thing its a baseball game for petes sake and theres no need to play through a tornado its not worth it im sure ill get roasted but you have to keep some perspective
1478736 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if lightning had hit the stands
1478737 i enjoyed my time here in chicago i wish it would have turned out different
1478738 but i tell you what the hardest part is saying goodbye to teammates its a great bunch of guys a great place to play unbelievable fans last nights game was a testament to what theyre all about here cheering just because we went back out after a two hour 45 minute rain delay and played that makes it worth it to leave on that note
1478739 you get to the point if you have a contending club the decisions are never easy in the big scheme of things its better to have tougher decisions than no decisions but at the same time you cant help but get emotionally attached to good players who also happen to be good citizens thats what hes been
1478740 i had a bad game in tampa then kind of got pushed aside
1478741 everyone else pitched so good you cant really go and complain say hey i want to pitch because everyone else is doing so well
1478742 i certainly wouldnt be surprised if we had some action on him now
1478743 i think he still has the ability to help a ballclub in the race or to get through the year even for a non contender
1478744 im going to hop in my rv and drive home to bradenton fla
1478745 my wife was packing up because she was leaving to go home anyway i just didnt get that chance to get back in there and pitch in chicago now maybe ill get to go somewhere else and pitch and play next season again

1478833 he was also quoted saying it was not easy and that if people saw him smoking it did not mean that he had quit and resumed but that he was trying to quit shah rukhs smoking made national headlines in january when ramadoss asked the star to learn from aamir khan and quit
1478834 we are very happy we were after him for a long while during an event organised in a school a small child had written a letter asking srk to quit smoking our mumbai officials took that letter and gave it to shah rukh but i guess quitting is not that easy it is heartening to see that he decided to do so because of his children being an icon he is going to inspire many youngsters to quit smoking
1478835 it is great news if he has really decided to quit
1478836 im not surprised its a southern food that i grew up eating i hope you enjoy it it would be great to have a new vegetable and more variety for you to throw into rotation

1478866 very fair and very strong statement that he constitutes this medal as being unfairly won
1478867 theres all the difference between a lie and what they call a mental reservation
1478868 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1478869 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1478870 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1478871 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1478872 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season

1478875 look i know what peoples automatic responses are and sometimes you work with them and sometimes you work against them in almost any scene you can go with an applause ending or a transitional ending its like sometimes you think oh shit please dont kiss now and they dont and you say thank god at other times here it comes here it comes and yay it happens but you cant bring out the basket of puppies every time
1478876 why do you say that you said that when you were describing another band too
1478877 we had no musical ideals to trust or lean on so we just had to believe in ourselves and each other

1478882 its up to the individual what kind of shrine one visits but it is also necessary to behave by giving consideration to various things from the position of chief cabinet secretary as a public figure
1478883 the credit cycle has turned in japan after several years of a very benign environment with abnormally low

1478885 pet owners come to us all the time to try to donate their dogs and we just have to tell them no
1478886 taiwanese dogs trend toward sickness or emotional instability so we have to look overseas
1478887 have allowed us to start building up our guide dog industry
1478888 we believe it was a fact we plan to protest strongly
1478889 while the photographer was released we protest strongly the violent detention against just journalistic activities
1478890 it is extremely regrettable that violence was used on a reporter who had been working following proper procedures
1478891 all states to take further practical steps and effective measures toward the total elimination of nuclear weapons with a view to achieving a peaceful and safe world free of nuclear weapons
1478892 seek to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal to the lowest number possible consistent with our security requirements and global commitments
1478893 we lawmakers represent japanese citizens so we have to gather and talk
1478894 the diet session does not really move forward unless we have discussions do you think the people prefer there be no discussions i dont think so
1478895 the worlds attention has been shifting from iraq to afghanistan
1478896 this tournament has elevated the sport of tennis in the countrys heartland while providing significant contributions to community causes this is a legacy we look forward to building upon
1478897 some people say an election is within range and i agree but to eradicate public anxiety and paint a better picture for the future i think we need a little more time
1478898 we are the ruling party and government that means we share policies and elections and we will discuss ways on how to deepen our trusting relationship and how to cooperate with each other to win the battle
1478899 from an international standpoint frankly i think 5 percent is low
1478900 without that it is wrong to discuss how much we should raise to gain the needed amount
1478901 the memory of the bomb droppings is getting further and further more and more distant even the threat of nuclear weapons has become more and more distant
1478902 its become something that people dont worry about on an everyday basis it doesnt seem like a big issue it still is but it may not seem that way certainly to the american public
1478903 hiroshima and nagasaki happened 63 years ago and its starting to feel like ancient history
1478904 its hard to have emotional connection with people and events that happened several generations ago
1478905 the fact that the survivors are still with us continue to go out and meet people and tell their stories and make this real to people is very important
1478906 curiosity at the very least about the experiences of hiroshima and nagasaki they are freer to relate because they do have a fear that their own city might be destroyed in a nuclear blast
1478907 has consistently been and remains to this day that the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were necessary to end the war
1478908 there is so much evidence now to the contrary thats just an insupportable argument anymore but thats controversial
1478909 hiroshima and nagasaki still lie uneasy on the american conscience any attempt to get rid of nuclear weapons really would be in a certain sense a struggle for the soul of the united states
1478910 but i feel that there probably is a sign of receptivity and greater openness to reconsidering that question i dont think they are necessarily antinuclear but they are getting interested in it they want to know what its all about
1478911 the civil society movements that are coming together around the nuclear issue are providing a lot of the substance of ideas for how to get there and i think thats the hopeful thing
1478912 we are in a far better position than weve been in for maybe more than 20 years certainly since the end of the cold war to really get somewhere with this issue and make an impact the elements we are doing that are certainly in place
1478913 i think thats something that they should have done all along
1478914 although its a small step forward what this whole episode has shown is that diplomacy really does work it really is the way to try to resolve these problems even with a country thats as isolated and as difficult to work with as north korea
1478915 nuclear free to me i dont mean to be cynical sounds unattainable to me i dont see how we can get there
1478916 i think the only way to get to a nuclear free world would be to get to a world in which the industrialized militarized mass production system upon which modern life depends collapses
1478917 i think we could be heading forward where the emphasis and the expenditure on nuclear weapons will go down at least on the part of the united states
1478918 there are tides of sanity in this world that are quiet but run deep on the nuclear issue and i can easily imagine them prevailing
1478919 when we have a new president in office we will see some modest positive efforts no matter what things will get better
1478920 we will engage more actively with the rest of the world we wont see this arrogance in american foreign policy that we have seen under president george w bush

1478923 christopher finan demonstrates that free speech has had its share of ups and many more downs
1478924 his highly readable journalistic account charts a tumultuous history from world war i into the immediate post 9 11 years first amendment principles were largely absent and the control shocking at the start of his narrative they took time to evolve but continued to suffer in a balancing act against calls for social order and fears of terrorism his conclusion joins the spirit and concerns of the namesake of the eli oboler award free speech can only survive through the determination of individuals and organizations to maintain the true ideals of america
1478925 beacon press publishes books that try to change the way that people think about fundamental issues we believe that exploring the history of free speech is essential to ensuring that our understanding and respect for the first amendment continue to grow
1478926 as i was walking down park row this morning a friend of mine tapped me on the shoulder and said al which would you rather be a cellar full of stepladders a basketful of doorknobs or a piece of cracked ice and i replied that i would rather be a fish because you can always break a pane of glass with a hammer
1478927 i certainly do not get the point to the gentlemans answer
1478928 you dont get the point to my answer well let me say to you that there is just as much point to my answer as there is to your question
1478929 the entire program of reconstruction not only met defeat but nothing was suggested in its place
1478930 the great forum for public discussion was darkened and the decisions that meant so much to the people of the state were made in a side room behind closed doors
1478931 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1478932 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1478933 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1478934 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1478935 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my coworkers and gain the respect of the organization

1478937 were trying to adjust a lot to the time difference and so a lot of us are resting trying to get our bodies right getting a lot of massages we went out on the town to check it out but besides that we didnt do much
1478938 we were looking at ways to change the terms of the cost equation for small geothermal power plants because there is a threshold beyond which people say that its just too expensive
1478939 we were looking at increases in performance and decreases in cost and what really attracted me to the united technologies concept was the fact that they were using off theshelf equipment they are taking existing chiller equipment and running it in reverse with very minor modifications which means that they are starting with a mass produced system with the potential to get the cost down to somewhere around 1 000 per kilowatt that represents a dramatic breakthrough
1478940 it can be serviced by a local carrier repairman who is already familiar with chillers so the maintenance infrastructure is already in place
1478941 we built and maintain ten miles of road and a 3 500 foot long runway a water system a sewer system power generation and a landfill for municipal waste and septage
1478942 we have our own microwave phone system we also became an electric utility recently and were soon to become a wireless phone utility to provide wireless service within fifty miles of chena hot springs in addition we will be making hydrogen on site and hope to have all of our vehicles running on hydrogen by the end of 2006
1478943 by the end of the year its our goal to be as close to being totally self sufficient as a community can be
1478944 geothermal is going to make a really significant contribution to the state of alaska
1478945 we are the first geothermal project running in the state and we are the first geothermal power project in the world making electricity from 165 water i believe that with utcs help we will make the most significant contribution to power generation in the twenty first century and i am very pleased to be a part of it

1478967 we would like to have the maximum effect with the least possible budget

1478973 osakas situation is desperate there is no choice the cuts had to be made and hashimoto showed real leadership in making them
1478974 it seems like hashimoto and his supporters in the ruling and opposition parties just took advantage of the governors popularity and pushed the cuts through i dont think he explained what the cuts are really going to mean to osakas school system
1478975 i had a choice of flying out of kansai to san francisco directly or flying via narita my travel agent told me it was actually slightly cheaper to use narita furthermore when i booked the narita flight i was able to choose an exit row seat that option didnt exist for the direct kansai flight i was told
1478976 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1478977 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1478978 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1478979 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1478980 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1478981 they came in they spoke of bonus money and royalties
1478982 they never said anything about pipelines whatsoever or any of the other bad things that weve learned about
1478983 in the past drilling was not taking place in the heart of the city

1478985 theres hundreds of thousands of dollars coming into here theres jobs being created
1478986 well i think we pay those journalists whether on channel 8 or channel 11 or the star telegram in terms of advertising support
1478987 we see this as pretty much instead of running the ads on the program were just writing the check direct
1478988 with all the lipstick you put on it its still a pig

1478991 and i think if you spoke to the fire chief today hed say we probably evacuated unnecessarily
1478992 you know so much of this is unknown and yet it is commonplace in west texas taking rural mentality and bringing it into a municipal area and those two often dont mix
1478993 gt b gt judge 10 million couldnt get crosby out

1479008 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1479009 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1479010 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1479011 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1479012 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1479013 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1479014 as far as sri lanka cricket slc is concerned it has not received any participation fee in the recently concluded indian premier league
1479015 we do not know about other boards but slc has not got any fee for allowing its players to play in the ipl

1479106 i m sure that everyone has heard the same argument put forward by the democrats at least a hundred times or more a vote for a third party candidate does nothing but insure a mccain win or a reasonable facsimile thereof
1479107 when i get to a point where my best is not good enough any more as i prepare and i practice and i get ready and i know if i go out there and play the way i know i can play and its just not good enough any more my skills have diminished that far its time for me to move on rack the cue and go home

1479124 he cant look at it say well if i suspend my best player were going to lose a couple of games maybe he cant look at it like that
1479125 im nobodys judge we put that in coach foxs hands
1479126 every day hes going to have to get the pulse of the team making sure guys are feeling good and talking to him

1479144 from what ive heard the ryder cup just isnt fun
1479145 the fun is sucked right out of it thats the word i hear a lot

1479252 i dont think anyone after seeing this will have any questions about fridas artistic journey
1479253 frida has to be read on one hand as an artist and on the other as a figure who put strong emphasis on an archetypal feminine problem
1479254 i think the ongoing fridamania would be something she herself would critique as she critiqued the social mores of the early 20th century such as the expectation that she would want to have a child

1479258 gingen nederlanders rond de eeuwwisseling nog naar frankrijk en spanje op vakantie nu komen toeristen uit die landen massaal naar nederland dit heeft als belangrijkste oorzaak de klimaatveranderingen
1479259 het geld dat de toeristen meebrengen zal worden gebruikt voor 2 doelen namelijk het zoeken naar oplossingen voor ons overvolle land en belastingverlagingen
1479260 ik heb begrepen dat men een afscheidsshow wil organiseren in carr met vrienden en veel bekende nederlanders jochem had dat schitterend gevonden

1479293 what should we do if a classmate drops a tub of markers all over the floor
1479294 what should we do if someone gets hurt or sick at recess

1479298 but we need a plan for charlotte avenue before we just go ahead and develop an area adjacent to it we need to co ordinate our plans
1479299 if you build a strip mall in the middle of a forest using compact florescent light bulbs doesnt make it a green building

1479305 but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter

1479307 how a relatively ragtag insurgency has managed to keep the worlds most powerful armies at bay
1479308 we went to afghanistan for the purpose of capturing osama bin laden and disbanding the taliban that was providing him with a base
1479309 this discussion seems to be premised on an assumption that our effort in afghanistan has morphed into a war on afghanistan
1479310 we are discussing a country with people that are terrorized by groups of extremists it is our job as one of the strongest powers to help them and show them a way out of the living in fear and in poverty
1479311 how can you nation build destroy poppie sic growing and defeat the taliban without troops when we know they terrorize the citizens and have no qualms about killing people
1479312 we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there
1479313 a year when democratic politicians stopped aping republicans on national security and started talking about reframing the debate
1479314 the u s invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
1479315 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under the u n charter because the attacks on sept 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states
1479316 the conflict in afghanistan will be far more costly and much much longer than americans realize
1479317 this war already in its seventh year will eventually become the longest in american history surpassing even vietnam
1479318 osama bin laden is still out there planning to attack the u s
1479319 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism

1479341 because i have to keep an eye on bob so that nobody gets wrapped in plastic
1479342 now you do have your ruby red sequined taco making shoes on right
1479343 now remember there are two sides of the magic mushroom one is the chill pill side and the other is the obstreperous side only a snipe will help you so dont be fooled on this errand a wild goose will not do no matter how pleasantly he minds his ps and qs and dont gyre and gimble because you have to be out of there by brillig or youll turn into sugar
1479344 damn it janet go see the man who began it janet when we met in his science exam it janet get moving janet youre late
1479345 can either of you tell me where i might find the snipe

1479353 dont get fruminous with me young lady ill only give you the chill pill mushroom if you can answer me a riddle
1479354 if your friends all jumped off a bridge would you do it too
1479355 now think carefully because if you answer wrong ill give you the obstreperous part
1479356 nobody has ever gotten it right but heres your chill pill mushroom
1479357 now you said youd leave if i gave you that and theres still a fair bit of half truth on my plate today and the jubjub is coming to dinner
1479358 we dont have as many long haul flights anymore so most of our blankets were actually sitting up in the overhead bins unused
1479359 the fact that most of them arent being used really makes the costs that are associated with it basically wasted money because they sit up there unused by passengers

1479368 in may nestle reported that its bottled water profits had dropped acknowledging criticism of bottled water as a factor in decreased sales according to beverage marketing corporation last year the u s bottled water industry experienced its slowest annual revenue growth in more than 15 years
1479369 california will challenge the environmental plan for a bottled water plant in siskiyou county if the company does not revise its contract to pump water from the mccloud river
1479370 it takes massive quantities of oil to produce plastic water bottles and to ship them in diesel trucks across the united states
1479371 nestle will face swift legal challenge if it does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions of gallons of spring water from the mccloud river into billions of plastic water bottles
1479372 in the worst cases nestles water grab ruins streams ponds wells and aquifers and in all cases nestles practices raise serious questions about who should be allowed to control water our most essential resource and to what end will corporations like nestle or the communities that rely upon this most essential resource for their health livelihood and well being control water resources

1479421 we have in our relentless social progress gloriously unleashed our powerful inventive exploratory urges they are a basic part of our biological inheritance there is nothing artificial or unnatural about them they provide us with our great strength as well as our great weaknesses what i am trying to show is the increasing price we have to pay for indulging them and the ingenious ways in which we contrive to meet that price no matter how steep that price becomes the stakes are rising all the time the game becoming more risky the casualties more startling the pace more breathless but despite the hazards it is the most exciting game the world has ever seen it is foolish to suggest that anyone should blow a whistle and try to stop it nevertheless there are different ways of playing it and if we can understand better the true nature of the players it should be possible to make the game even more rewarding without at the same time becoming more dangerous and ultimately disastrous for the whole species
1479422 one of the most fateful errors of our age is the belief that the problem of production has been solved this illusion is mainly due to our inability to recognise that the modern industrial system with all its intellectual sophistication consumes the very base on which it has been erected to use the language of the economist it lives on irreplaceable capital which it cheerfully treats as income fossil fuels the tolerance margins of nature and the human substance
1479423 the idea of unlimited economic growth more and more until everybody is saturated with wealth needs to be seriously questioned on at least two counts the availability of basic resources and alternatively or additionally the capacity of the environment to cope with the degree of interference implied
1479424 if human vices such as greed and envy are systematically cultivated the inevitable result is nothing less than the collapse of intelligence

1479429 the fear is that a going concern opinion can hasten the demise of an already troubled company reduce a loan officers willingness to grant a line of credit to that troubled company or increase the point spread that would be charged if that company were granted a loan auditors are placed at the center of a moral and ethical dilemma whether to issue a going concern opinion and risk escalating the financial distress of their client or not issue a going concern opinion and risk not informing interested parties of the possible failure of the company

1479447 the fact that the self funded plan which covers you is exempt from state law means that it does not have to provide certain benefits such as minimum post partum hospital stay required under state law a savings for your employer but a good deal for you not so much
1479448 it gets worse lets say your self funded plan knowingly refuses life saving care for your covered spouse and he she ends up dying as a result as happened to julie pierces husband tracy featured in michael moores documentary sicko
1479449 just how much more did the school district pay out in medical claims than they collected in premiums this year
1479450 the real performance impact is going to be an overall slow down and an increase in memory footprint for the vast majority of applications that dont need and dont want unicode but which will
1479451 i dont see how it could be that much slower if at all because currently everything gets converted to unicode at the api level anyway if anything wouldnt it be a tad bit faster as that internal conversion wont be needed
1479452 parents should be able to work hard and provide a better life for their children
1479453 i have other sheep which are not of this fold
1479454 i say im strongest in carrying the team being the leader
1479455 you cant really call that a position but thats a main role on the team if you dont have that then the team can just break away so you have to keep the team together keep it rolling everybody sees me as a combo guard or whatever i can be the point i can be the shooting guard i can play small forward you can put me at center and ill play as hard as i can the position doesnt matter im just a basketball player
1479456 that shouldnt be a reason somebody goes to a school
1479457 youre not playing his life youre playing with your life i wouldnt mind playing with him but me coming here the history that uconn has maybe thats the same reason he came here i look at it from that perspective

1479462 the contractor will include a principle cyber investigator a locally specialized threat analyst a foreign speaking analyst with cyber investigative skills and a constant watch team

1479464 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1479465 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1479466 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1479467 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1479468 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1479469 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1479470 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1479471 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1479472 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1479473 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1479474 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1479475 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1479476 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1479477 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery

1479483 the projections in the ocs outer continental shelf access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1479484 production would reach 200 000 barrels a day 0 2 percent of projected world production at peak production in close to twenty years
1479485 the global population burned energy at a rate of 13 5 tw
1479486 conservative estimates of energy use place our global energy need at 28 35 tw in 2050
1479487 the message is clear the additional energy we need in 2050 over the current 13 5 tw base is simply not attainable from long discussed sources the global appetite for energy is simply too great
1479488 nocera argues that the only real alternative for carbon neutral energy production is some form of solar power more energy from sunlight strikes the earth in one hour than humanity uses in a year but converting sunlight into energy useful to people is a huge unsolved technological problem in 2000 author richard rhodes and nuclear engineer denis beller calculated that using current solar power technologies to construct a global solar energy system would consume at least 20 percent of the worlds known iron resources take a century to build and cover a half million square miles clearly a lot of technological innovation needs to take place before solar becomes an option for fueling the world
1479489 the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1479490 mit researchers have overcome a major barrier to large scale solar power storing energy for use when the sun doesnt shine
1479491 inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants nocera and matthew kanan a postdoctoral fellow in have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the suns energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases later the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel cell creating carbon free electricity to power your house or your electric car day or night
1479492 tony blair was told by mi6 before the invasion of iraq that a high placed and potentially credible iraqi source was saying that saddam hussein had no weapons of mass destruction intelligence that was passed to the us but buried by the white house according to an explosive new book the book claims that mr blair sent a top british spy to the middle east at the beginning of 2003 three months before the invasion to dig up enough intelligence to avoid war but that president bush and vice president cheney dismissed any claims or possible evidence that would derail the invasion

1479498 dont worry we will continue to kill scores of palestinians
1479499 the soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as 79 billion by years end an american federal oversight agency has concluded in an analysis released on tuesday
1479500 every time bush threatens iran by saying that all options are on the table including the military one oil spikes
1479501 prices would go a lot higher and stay there too if the market really believed that an attack on iran were imminent
1479502 the message is clear the additional energy we need in 2050 over the current 13 5 tw base is simply not attainable from long discussed sources the global appetite for energy is simply too great
1479503 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1479504 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion

1479580 we achieved higher than expected revenue and adjusted ebitda in the second quarter
1479581 much of our success can be attributed to growth in our owned and operated properties demonstrating the progress the team has made in executing the companys new initiatives as we look toward the remainder of the year we are optimistic about our ability to grow profitably
1479582 despite a tough economic and industry environment and despite simulcast signal disputes with horsemen we were able to grow revenue and ebitda over 2007 levels we have generated 85 million in cash from operations so far this year which has been used to pay down the debt used to fund the acquisition of certain assets of americatab bloodstock research information services and the thoroughbred sports network in june 2007
1479583 based on the maturity of our centrifuge and plant design usec has undergone a rigorous process over the past several months to develop a comprehensive budget the budget reflects a bottom up roll up of detailed work breakdown structure activities and reflects extensive input from our suppliers
1479584 as we look ahead we are cautious about increasing softness in the consumer markets and global economic uncertainty for the third quarter of 2008 we expect revenues to grow sequentially by 4 to 6 which is below the level of historical seasonality due to uncertainty around consumer demand
1479585 since 2006 we have been successfully executing on the picop commercialization strategy against our publicly communicated operational milestone as we get closer to product introduction the specific timing of product launch is expected to be determined by final commercialization of key components by our strategic supply chain partners and by established commercial product launch windows of our customers with respect to key components most of our strategic suppliers continue to meet original product development timelines some have experienced longer development and commercialization cycles than were originally anticipated this is not unusual for bringing new technologies to market the good news is that in the instances where progress has been delayed these companies have invested millions of dollars and continue to communicate their commitment to bring their components to market because of the large market opportunity in addition we have been pursuing dual supply chain capabilities in several key areas and consequently remain optimistic about getting the picop display engine to market in 2009
1479586 strong results in the first half of 2008 combined with the current commodity price environment and hedges in place have resulted in increased 2008 income and cash flow guidance in the natural gas gathering and processing segment and natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation segment the natural gas liquids pipelines segments 2008 income has been adjusted to reflect the previously announced delay of the overland pass pipeline which is expected to become operational in the third quarter 2008 additional information is available in exhibits a and b
1479587 during the second quarter the significant decline in our cost of financing combined with the relatively stable asset yield and amortization of premium produced the expected material increase in our net interest spread and earnings per share when compared to the first quarter also during the second quarter the value of agency mbs declined in value but the value of interest rate swap agreements increased by a greater amount which resulted in a significant increase in our book value per common share we view this portfolio of floating rate to fixed rate swap agreements as a major tool in our risk management program and believe that overall these instruments can help reduce the effects of interest rate changes on book value and income earning capability we are also comfortable with our quarter end level of financial leverage since our significant preferred stock and long term debt position currently provides our common stockholders with the benefit of higher leverage for income purposes and the benefit of lower leverage for overall risk management purposes
1479588 we continue to execute against our permitting timeline and have filed applications for the key nevada state permits although we recognize that we do not fully control the ultimate timing our technical data for the eis continues to be submitted in a timely manner and we continue to expect all the key nevada state issued permits will be received no later than q1 2009 and the final eis record of decision in mid 2009
1479589 our results so far this year have been significantly impacted by our reduced marketing levels from mid 2007 as expected a significant number of credit card accounts added in 2007 reached their peak vintage charge off levels in the first and second quarters of this year at the end of q2 the cos 60 plus day delinquency rate stood at its lowest level in two years
1479590 our business model has been highly successful and we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and as our company continues to evolve however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales this combined with our commitment to maintaining financial flexibility and investing prudently in our long term growth has led us to take a more conservative approach to our growth and business strategy over the short term
1479591 despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions and consumer environment in the second quarter we returned to profitability generating strong earnings as compared with a year ago
1479592 we positively impacted our top line by shipping a broad assortment of polk audio products to approximately 900 best buy stores and earning additional ip royalty revenue related to our security and convenience business further demonstrating our competitive advantage in this category in addition we secured hyundai motors canada as a remote start customer with initial shipments expected in the third quarter
1479593 oneoks performance was driven by continued strong results in our oneok partners segment which has had another exceptional quarter as a result of higher commodity prices and increased volumes
1479594 new rate mechanisms in oklahoma continue to benefit our distribution segment our energy services segment had lower than expected results due to reduced transportation margins
1479595 cisco delivered solid quarterly and annual results as network enabled business process changes and productivity increases gain traction on a global basis todays strong results demonstrate the companys ability to execute the market is clearly in transition and we will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to aggressively move into market adjacencies our focus is on our portfolio approach to technology innovation a broad global footprint and management dedicated to sustainable differentiation and execution we believe we are entering the next phase of the internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by networked web 2 0 technologies
1479596 we recently announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by transwitch corporation and the transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2008
1479597 we are excited about this partnership and we believe that the combined company will be a strong leader in the communications ic sector we also believe that this partnership will lead to exciting new opportunities for our optical and voip businesses and enable the combined company to better serve its customers and increase shareholder value
1479598 with the conclusion of the gsk collaboration we will soon know the ownership of the compounds in our pipeline this knowledge will allow us to manage our pipeline thoughtfully prioritize the pipeline develop some of the compounds and partner others
1479599 economic uncertainty and high fuel prices are affecting the broad travel market and significant airline capacity reductions in the fall will also have a negative impact through the first half of the year we believe that the positive trends impacting our domestic and international businesses have overshadowed these negative influences we believe these trends position us for attractive top line and earnings growth for the balance of the year and beyond
1479600 in the second quarter we delivered sequential revenue growth of 2 this was our 17th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and our fourth consecutive quarter of non gaap net income
1479601 since the close of the quarter we have seen a dramatic slowdown in our moca business specifically related to the verizon fios deployment due to the sequential drop in verizon fios subscriber growth in the second quarter and a resulting increase in inventory positions of moca based customer premises equipment for verizon we expect significant softness in sales of our moca product line for the third quarter we expect this situation to be partially mitigated by the ramp in our dbs outdoor unit business at directv our primary focus this quarter will be to drive new design wins across our product lines and to drive next generation product development efforts while focusing on operating expense control
1479602 we are pleased with the strong revenues and continued momentum for nexavar globally with net sales reaching 168 5 million in the second quarter indicating expanding global demand for the brand based on a series of rolling launches worldwide we expect to see additional growth opportunities for nexavar particularly for the treatment of liver cancer
1479603 with fda approval of the recothrom r 20 000 iu vial and the spray kit co packaged with this larger vial we now have a full line of product presentations available for sale this together with contracts now in place with several large group purchasing organizations should help to accelerate market conversion in the second half of the year
1479604 further we have increased our financial strength through the 100 million funding commitment from deerfield management
1479605 we are pleased with our expected results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended june 30 2008 we experienced the anticipated rebound from the seasonally slow march quarter and rates for our services continue to be strong despite some weakness in demand in certain local markets overall vessel utilization remains solid primarily due to our significant proportion of long term charter contracts these contracts have an average remaining duration of approximately 2 5 years our fleetwide vessel utilization was 85 for the fourth quarter and 84 for the full year
1479606 this projection is further evidence of our successful focus on improved year over year net earnings based on our guidance our net earnings will have increased by 104 over the latest three years
1479607 suns products are used in diversified equipment markets around the globe many of these markets such as mining and energy remain strong and demand is high in other more obvious markets such as equipment used in residential and commercial construction we have begun to see some softening the diversity of our end markets both geographically and the segments we participate in is pivotal to maintaining our growth
1479608 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007
1479609 while demand for our hotels remains strong we continued to experience higher levels of attrition in the quarter and we have projected similar attrition levels for the rest of this year as we have pointed out on multiple occasions when a group turns up with fewer delegates than they bargained for we lose the gross revenue that would have been generated had they filled their block but we collect attrition fees that essentially cover our lost profitability we believe that as a result it is prudent to trim our revpar and total revpar guidance for fy08
1479610 as for our indoor phone business and our cosun branded mobile phone business we maintain our forecast that their revenue will grow at a yearly rate of about 30 with the launch of a series of quality and differentiated products and marketing campaigns planned for the second half of 2008
1479611 first our focus on maintaining our pricing discipline combined with a further weakening in the economy is causing us to lower our enrollment expectations for the full year also it is now apparent that medicare health care costs are running higher than previous expectations we believe we addressed these issues in our 2009 bid submitted in early june as a result we expect improvements in our medicare performance across both the medicare advantage and part d businesses in 2009
1479612 although health care costs were relatively stable in the second quarter we currently expect commercial health care costs to run modestly higher in the second half of 2008
1479613 we believe we will maintain a positive spread in commercial premium yields versus health care costs through the balance of 2008
1479614 based on our encouraging financial trends available cash and newly secured credit facility we are well positioned to drive toward profitability importantly minimally invasive procedure times of 60 minutes and patients discharged from the hospital at two days or less combined with our reported clinical results are clear indicators of our progress and the large and growing opportunity for our products
1479615 we are working on a number of related fronts to accelerate adess revenue growth and profit potential most notably our first activated carbon manufacturing facility while we experienced delays in the second quarter due to our engineering contractor being acquired by another company we have continued to make progress on this project in a number of areas we have obtained the final construction permit secured purchase of the building site and now that the acquisition has been completed we are currently finalizing terms pricing and schedule on our engineering construction contract based on the current status of key negotiations we hope to be breaking ground in the next few weeks to enable us to remain on schedule to begin ac production in the first half of 2010
1479616 our financial performance in the second quarter benefited from another exceptional quarter by our u s business with gains in sales volume pricing and underlying income we are excited about this strong momentum as we launch millercoors across our company our top brands continue to outperform the industry in the second quarter and we achieved net pricing gains and substantial cost savings in each of our core markets at the same time however energy and commodity inflation has become a bigger challenge for our company and for the global beer industry this cost inflation combined with our higher tax rate drove lower after tax income for our total company in the quarter in the face of challenging economic conditions we continue to implement value adding strategies that will allow us to build our brands achieve positive pricing reduce costs and grow profits and cash for our shareholders the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are more excited than ever about the future for molson coors brewing company as we strive to become a top performing global brewer
1479617 given our limited visibility on the timing of the recovery of commercial vehicle demand including lower expectations in trailer production we feel it prudent to reduce the range of our fiscal 2008 guidance to 85 100 million of adjusted ebitda based on estimated north american class 8 production of 190 000 to 215 000 units and class 5 7 production of 170 000 to 190 000 units however we expect to breakeven in free cash flow for the year due to our continued focus on working capital management and the reduction of capital expenditures
1479618 we are in the early stages of a two year plan to recognize the synergies from recent acquisitions this quarter we grew operating margins through sales growth as well as cost reduction initiatives going forward investors should expect to see both top line growth through the introduction of new product technologies to current and new customers and bottom line growth as we diligently undertake further consolidation and integration efforts
1479619 were reporting record revenues and earnings a continuation of our aggressive growth strategy and the achievement of numerous capital market milestones i couldnt be more pleased with our financial report for the second quarter in particular with our 33 organic revenue growth rate in our visiting nurse vn segment total revenue growth in the vn segment where we focus most of our effort was 66 over the same quarter last year and 30 over the first quarter of 2008
1479620 we are raising our 08 production estimate range to 77 80 bcfe from its prior estimate of 74 78 bcfe we also anticipate an increase in capital expenditures to 625 650 million up 50 million which will include increased 2008 drilling at our piceance and west tavaputs projects and we are achieving lower lease operating expenses and have reduced the estimated cost per mcfe to 0 62 0 65 from 0 64 0 68
1479621 the interest expressed from both new and existing customers for our fiber lasers is a strong indicator that the momentum we established in the first half of the year will continue for the second half of 2008 we expect that materials processing applications will continue to be our primary growth driver
1479622 in june we announced positive results of our second phase 3 clinical trial of fampridine sr in multiple sclerosis which were consistent with the results of our successful first phase 3 trial we are now focused on completing our new drug application or nda which we expect to file in the first quarter of 2009 in addition our zanaflex franchise continued to deliver solid performance in the face of a genericized market
1479623 many of our u s and european markets face uncertain economic conditions brought on by high energy prices and other well publicized factors we expect these developments combined with normal seasonal reductions in activity to slow our rate of growth in the second half of the year in comparison to the first half however we expect our operating performance to continue to improve and our operating results to exceed those we reported in the second half of 2007
1479624 in europe we remain encouraged by the continued acceptance of our new bioabsorbable septal repair implant technology biostar
1479625 in this tough economic environment we continue to concentrate on the items in our business that we control such as maximizing revenue per day vehicle utilization cost reduction and service delivery
1479626 our focus in todays environment is on executing every day in every market with every customer
1479627 for q1 the co expects organic sales to increase 4 6 organic volume is expected to grow 2 3 and the combination of pricing and product mix is expected to add 2 3 in addition foreign exchange is forecast to add approximately 4 5 and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures is estimated to reduce sales growth by about 1 total sales are expected to increase 7 10
1479628 a number of factors adversely affected earnings and caused the second quarter to fall short of expectations including challenges in our manufacturing segment and the impact of a rate case decision in minnesota
1479629 although we expect improved earnings in the second half of 2008 we do not expect to make up the second quarter shortfall and reach the 2008 earnings guidance set forth last quarter therefore given the second quarter results and uncertainty with economic conditions for the balance of the year we are lowering earnings per share guidance to a range of 1 40 to 1 65 from our previous guidance of 1 75 to 2 00

1479632 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1479633 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1479634 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1479635 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1479636 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1479637 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1479638 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1479639 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1479640 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1479641 were talking about the congo basin rainforest here it is vast it is huge its second only to the amazon and its impenetrable

1479649 march 14 has certainly made the most concessions as witnessed in the government composition where the opposition has been able to secure as many key ministries for its allies as march 14 which has parliamentary majority
1479650 march 14 is based on the principles of sovereignty democracy and self determination for lebanon
1479651 in light of what we have had to contend with in the last three years whether the assassinations mainly targeting march 14 members the sit in sabotage of the presidential election which was postponed for more than six months the may 7 coup d tat by hezbollah that led to the fighting and the current continuous obstruction process the fact that march 14 is still able to operate is a miracle
1479652 the cohabitation between the state and hezbollahs armed organisation is rendering the march 14 mission of nation building impossible
1479653 hezbollahs weapons are tied to a regional strategy as witnessed in the recent speeches of iranian officials stressing that stability in lebanon palestine and iraq can only be achieved through an international agreement on irans nuclear dossier
1479654 we need to focus our slogans and approach on the problem of hezbollahs weapons

1479680 if people are in denial about this issue they need to wake up
1479681 there is very much a concern of ours that without passes there will be some students who will not attend school

1479687 mr mundell wrote a wonderful story that has been successful for many years i admire him for that but we have the opportunity now to bring out a new story we would like to present an entire trilogy about the shawnee people with the first part being done in 2009 although that may have to wait until 2010
1479688 before that we need to stabilize finances and finalize a plan about how to go forward we owe mr mundell money we owe a lot of people money including myself
1479689 some of the bills stem from 2004 and 2005 the debt is not out of the ordinary for an outdoor drama so we hope to turn this around

1479696 is the election all about obama i dont know but i do know that a faulty story line in the way the election is covered for the next three months wont help either of the candidates run a better campaign or voters understand whats really happening is it too late to change the script
1479697 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1479698 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1479699 he voted against fuel efficiency standards for cars he opposed legislation to provide tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against solar power against wind power against biofuels against an energy bill that despite its flaws represented the largest investment in renewable energy in the history of this country he was dr no
1479700 barack obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy and it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1479701 lloyd vincent started to initiate a traffic stop on the motorcycle who then fled and led him on a high speed pursuit
1479702 sheriff karl byrd was patrolling and was involved but when the speed got too high the sheriff called the search off
1479703 they didnt have any charges for him because he stopped immediately
1479704 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1479705 since speaker pelosi has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote to take place we urge you to use the power vested in you by the constitution to convene an immediate energy special session of congress

1479710 no the continuance and victory of the cause of god which the christian church is to serve with her witness is not unconditionally linked with the forms of existence which it has had until now
1479711 yes the hour may strike and perhaps has already struck when god to our discomfiture but to his glory and for the salvation of mankind will put an end to this mode of existence because it lacks integrity
1479712 yes it could be our duty to free ourselves inwardly from our dependency on that mode of existence even while it still lasts indeed on the assumption that it may one day entirely disappear we should look about us for new ventures in new directions
1479713 yes as the church of god we may depend on it that if only we are attentive god will show us such new ways as we can hardly anticipate now
1479714 seem more the type to create molds rather than filling them
1479715 dont ever tell me i cant do something because doing so will drive me to do it at all costs just to prove to you that i can
1479716 yes i love you because i said it in my word therefore i have to and yes youll get to come to heaven but id rather you just stay over in the corner and be quiet
1479717 last week former us speaker dennis hastert and i sat with leaders from the four caucuses to present a compromise that addresses many of the concerns that legislators had posed with the previous capital plan now that they have had time to review our proposal i will convene a special session so that they can pass a plan this summer that will repair and rebuild our states infrastructure and put illinoisans to work
1479718 when people are paying more at the pump paying more at the grocery store and paying more in property taxes it would be financially crippling to make them pay more in taxes
1479719 if the house democrats plan on raising the income tax on working families they need to make their intentions known now and not wait until after the election
1479720 unless they find the funding theres nothing much more to do with the budget
1479721 well when i was a kid and went down for share the fun we bunked down above the cattle barn
1479722 you have a priest who was in ministry and in education and im sad to say that at this school behind us in the late 80s he roamed free raping and pillaging children at will
1479723 did an investigation and they told the victims to be quiet and they would transfer him
1479724 theyre about four months into the pregnancy shes thrilled angie cant wait to flaunt her bump
1479725 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1479726 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1479727 for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there
1479728 theres this whole weird rumor going around one of them says that he proposed and i said no and the other says he proposed and i said yes and were getting married neither one is true
1479729 hough is going to get his new partner in a couple weeks we have no clue who the going to be im hoping it is someone whos like 70 80 years old
1479730 this community gay for me is my beloved community this true colors tour is not a money making venture i have been running with this community all my life and when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil
1479731 the guy who saved the white house one of the heroes who crashed that plane on 9 11 was gay the rugby player mark bingham who died on united 93 and does bush ever mention that does he f k
1479732 that gay guy saved his lousy ass and this guy who says he prays to god this guy who promotes hate and fear this guy we call our president this guy is the true anti american
1479733 photographers moved into apartments next door to us and we really found ourselves kind of living like a spy movie i feel like they think they have to be there like they punch in or something
1479734 i really think we have a long way to go as far as being able to keep our intensity and practicing for a purpose the entire practice because there was a point because of the heat and the fatigue that some guys were just practicing to get through the practice as opposed to get better
1479735 i would much rather come into a situation where we have experience on the offensive front experience on the defensive front and some inexperience at the skill position because we know that the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game
1479736 that allows you to be able to build our team with the young skill guys that we have
1479737 ive been able to do this a couple of times and i know how to go through that
1479738 you just have to put all that in the back of your head and just concentrate on what we are doing now
1479739 he knows we have high expectations for him hes starting to have those same expectations out of himself
1479740 we work hard on his technique i think his accuracy has really gone up i look forward to him having a good year for us
1479741 i do believe you do some hitting everyday and you get used to it and you get better at it i believe thats how you stay healthy
1479742 they definitely worked hard in the summer but im not sure it all showed up
1479743 there were some guys out there who were maybe trying a bit too hard and when you do that you kind of wear out a little quicker
1479744 offensively it was pretty easy defensively it was close and that was why we had three captains on defense instead of two
1479745 weve talked about what our expectations are in the classroom and off the field and how to conduct ourselves socially
1479746 were going to continue to work hard toward that and certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer were not proud of its not going to continue
1479747 were low risk i honestly dont believe a single patient died because of this
1479748 the investigator was worried that if the names ever got out it would be a shame for the participating people
1479749 i think were in the best position we can be
1479750 its kind of like nobody expects too much but they dont expect us to do really really bad
1479751 for us its nice we hope teams take us lightly go ahead and make that mistake and let us catch you when youre taking us lightly and well show you how you shouldnt have
1479752 obviously every coach in the country in college football right now is undefeated and optimistic and theres a lot of work to be done before we can project how this season is going to turn out
1479753 but i can tell you im as excited as ive ever been going into a season with a football team and the product were going to put on the field
1479754 the defense as a whole we have to fill some positions in the secondary but on the front seven were pretty solid
1479755 everybody is really optimistic and has a positive outlook for the defense we feel pretty strong going into camp
1479756 we are in the lowest precip period of the year
1479757 we really need all arkansans if at all possible to avoid burning to try to prevent additional fires
1479758 that was simply because we were starting to see an increase in fires
1479759 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1479760 p urchasing real estate at a young age paid off huge for me living a pretty frugal lifestyle while planning for a family and working hard on my business allowed me to take chances
1479761 whenever you are dealing with with anything of importance get it in writing this includes things such as a contract for employment salary negotiation contractors estimate negotiating a purchase or anything else that involves money or a service if you dont get it in writing you open the door to unscrupulous people trying to take advantage of you
1479762 just like how the fdic insures bank deposits in the event of a bank failure sipc insures investment accounts in the event of a failure the sipc only covers losses due to a brokerage failure or other unscrupulous activity sipc does not insure losses that occur as a part of regular market fluctuation
1479763 many of us have frittered away some of our money on occasion but what if were able to put a stop to the mindless spending that eats up our money without us even realizing it
1479764 im still going through the process of narrowing it down
1479765 i just want to make the right choice and just go through the whole process i plan to take my visits and decide after the season
1479766 it was real nice and the coaches are all cool i got to know them pretty well and just like how they are all laid back and friends with their players
1479767 im still going through the process of narrowing it down
1479768 i just want to make the right choice and just go through the whole process i plan to take my visits and decide after the season
1479769 plus they always seem to produce some pretty good cornerbacks and have a good defense they also have real nice facilities and campus too
1479770 i thought about the distance and i talked about it with my mom and we agreed that it wont be an issue
1479771 they send me the most mail and keep in contact
1479772 i like that they have a great track program too id really like to be able to continue my track career in college
1479773 ive talked to most of the coaches about it and they said that as long as i can keep up with me schoolwork theyre cool with me running track
1479774 im looking for a program that has a good sports management major
1479775 i also want a good social environment outside of football i want to play for good coaches that i get along with but im the kind of guy who will fit in with any coaching style i dont have a preference
1479776 i dont know much about them except that they always have a great defense
1479777 they are a top program in the big ten every year and always go to bowl games
1479778 when we have a site that tracks where you have visited updates the
1479779 of course i was surprised nikki is one of my really dear friends and shes not a person that i would ever expect to have that controversy surrounding her but at the same time you know things get misconstrued in this business

1479970 you cannot see the great wall from space yang liwei chinas first man in space said he was unable to see the wall while orbiting the globe in october 2003 but in todays china its getting even harder to see it from the ground photos taken of the great wall a century ago show one that is very different to what the world knows today one such picture of a section of the great wall known as the sister towers shows two mighty stone guard towers built into a hillside dotted with trees and shrubs strong and imposing they overlook a broad river they are a sign of strength confidence and glory a symbol that all china could be proud of a photo showing the condition of the towers today is deeply shocking all that remains is a few layers of base stones of one of the towers the other is wholly gone a phantom the two photographic images placed side by side play tricks with your mind first the shock then comes the wonder then comes sadness as you realize that in this case gone means forever even the river has gone sucked up by chinas overuse of water and neglect both based on the fallacy that economic development should take precedence over historical preservation the hillside shows a few straggly trees and an expanse of bare soil and rock william lindesay a british activist dedicated to protecting the wall spoke to a local dweller 82 year old lu wencai the towers arent here anymore theyre gone said lu lu told lindesay that the towers were first damaged by japanese bombers in the second world war but says lu the real damage came in the 1970s when the peoples liberation army built a railway into the area they dismantled the towers and used their stones to build temporary shelters once the soldiers had gone the locals used the bricks themselves lus story can be found repeated all along the great wall as decades of neglect and active abuse have destroyed one of the greatest feats of construction completed by mankind often china cries we are the victim of foreign intervention which in many cases has caused big difficulties for the country however the destruction of the great wall and the present lack of attention it receives is entirely caused by the neglect of the chinese people it is as if the words chinese and culture are at war with each other
1479971 but one part of chinas cultural history does get a lot of attention the yuanmingyuan or garden of perfection and delight this garden painstakingly built by six generations of qing dynasty emperors was burned and looted by british and french forces in 1860 as a lesson to china since that time it has remained a ruin but in 2004 a meeting was held to discuss whether it should be restored the consensus was that it should not be restored the ruins are the most concrete evidence of western atrocities and should be reserved as the scene of a crime the lonely desolated site is a silent accusation of the aggressive acts of foreign invaders serving as an ideal place for a patriotic education said ye yanfang a researcher at the chinese academy of sciences another commentator said without rehabilitation the yuanmingyuan displays explicitly the crimes committed by the western allied forces as time goes by the new yuanmingyuan may obliterate the painful history in the minds of chinese people the victim mentality again but as so often china is as much the victim of its own people as of external powers many cultural relics did in fact survive the looting by the british and french but they were lost over the succeeding decades as the chinese people themselves slowly took away objects from the garden and in the cultural revolution there was extreme destruction as 800 meters of garden wall were knocked down 1 000 ancient trees cut down and numerous other objects looted or destroyed who is calling for a memorial to the destruction china has visited upon itself no one for china as a victim the aggressor must always be someone beyond its borders
