6210029 the interceptors look like ordinary missiles stored in silos with highly automated warheads that are not loaded with any explosives if fired the missile is intended to home in on and destroy its target above the atmosphere due to the kinetic energy of the collision but the closing speed of interceptor and target will be 24 000km h 15 000mph making the task more difficult than hitting a bullet with another bullet the us has spent more than 100bn 54bn in the last two decades on its controversial project to develop defences against ballistic missiles critics say that despite all that money the pentagon still has not proved the system can work in realistic conditions

6210051 with apple shapes where people tend to have large waists with skinny legs and hips the risk of high cholesterol and heart disease is higher what weve found is that the fat tissue that lines the abdomen the adipose fat is high in the inflammatory markers that lead to heart and cholesterol problems
6210052 as women age their cholesterol profile changes because as estrogen levels go down the hdl or good cholesterol also goes down and the ldl or the bad cholesterol goes up
6210053 in men the low testosterone levels that sometimes occur in 50s and 60s can increase the risk for heart disease pre diabetes and insulin resistance
6210054 during this time we also see an increase in abdominal fat so its actually the opposite of women where we see a decrease in estrogen causing an increase in adipose fat

6210080 independents have a direct and immediate interest in the outcome of this litigation cuip believes that this litigation is of national significance and if plaintiffs prevail it will encourage partisans in other states with some form of open primary to seek to close them

6210088 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company

6210096 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6210097 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6210098 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6210099 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6210100 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6210101 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid

6210105 if this non surgical procedure provides results that are comparable to those of conventional weight loss surgeries it may provide a good option for patients who need to lose a significant amount of weight but do not wish to have surgery

6210108 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6210109 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease

6210218 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6210219 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6210220 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124

6210372 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6210373 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6210374 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6210375 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6210376 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6210377 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6210378 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6210379 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease
6210380 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6210381 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
6210382 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
6210383 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
6210384 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
6210385 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
6210386 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
6210387 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
6210388 clearly demonstrate that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behavior
6210389 so far our fluorescent sensor technology has been used in blood diagnostic cassettes worldwide if for example you have an accident and need blood an ambulance crew can analyse your blood at the scene and tell the a amp e unit to arrange for a certain type of blood with the necessary salt levels ready at the hospital for your arrival
6210390 now we have extended our sensor designs and discovered other possible uses one such use could be as an id tag for cells in an epidemic such as a bird flu outbreak from a population our sensor molecules could help track infection and highlight vulnerable people
6210391 also as logic gates are what drive current computers molecular versions of these gates open very interesting possibilities
6210392 it is exciting to think that these tiny molecules can perform small scale computational operations in spaces where semiconductors cannot go in spite of all their power
6210393 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6210394 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6210395 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6210396 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6210397 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives

6210400 employers must develop new recruitment and retention policies unprecedented conditions a multi generational workforce a shrinking labor pool and an increasing demand for skilled workers dictate that they do so
6210401 sloan award winners have put into practice their bold ideas about how to make work work in the 21st century and they have shown how they can support the needs of their employees while also making their organizations more effective and successful
6210402 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6210403 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6210404 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
6210405 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
6210406 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6210407 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6210408 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6210409 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
6210410 im not going to mention any names because they are famous and very rich people but i remember when we were in a room and they were very famous and rich at the time and i was just charlie eddies brother and they were talking about rap and it was like yo yeah this rap stuff this hippity hippity stuff is this fad that will go away
6210411 and i was like no its not rap is going to be one of the biggest forms of music on the planet and i remember they all laughed in my face
6210412 i also have a person that i know who was a rapper and he was good
6210413 as a result i think 50 cent is based on gusto
6210414 the story of cb4 is that a rapper took his name from a real gangster and then tried to personified that persons character in their music
6210415 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6210416 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6210417 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6210418 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these
6210419 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
6210420 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury

6210429 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6210430 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6210431 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6210432 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6210433 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6210434 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6210435 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6210436 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans
6210437 we were pleased with our earnings performance for the second quarter our same store sales continue to be impacted by the current economic environment however we believe our marketing and messaging helped us during the quarter as our comparable sales performance continued to outpace the chicken qsr segment as we move into the second half of this year we are excited to be rolling out three new menu platforms designed to generate incremental sales with a focus on portability value and lunch occasions
6210438 at the conclusion of our second quarter i am satisfied that we are managing our resources well in a difficult market environment we remain confident in our full year earnings guidance our highly franchised business model continues to generate strong ebitda margins and solid free cash flows giving us the ability to invest in the initiatives that will return maximum value to our shareholders

6210459 what is the use of this information why should go around looking up this stuff learning about something like this when will it ever be useful to me
6210460 never you will probably never have any use of this at all but you will need to be able to look stuff up to understand how to use science books encyclopedias and so on and know how to organize this information select from it and write it down in an orderly manner and you need practice in how to memorize important things so the knowledge you need is readily available whatever you learn now is just to practice skills like that

6210577 no me incomoda para nada ser de color lo que pasa es que ltimamente con tanto problemita que he tenido el ltimo haber disparado con un fusil en abril pasado pens que puede ser por racismo porque como siempre me han perseguido por el hecho de ser famoso entonces nunca le hab a prestado atenci n a lo del racismo y esta vez acept el reto de intentar cambiar de color a ver si los problemas que se presentan son por el color o soy yo
6210578 es que a medida que pasa el tiempo he tenido tantos problemas que quisiera ver c mo la gente me ver a de otro color para ver si le prestamos m s atenci n a tanto racismo que hay en colombia y en el mundo porque tambi n lo viv en italia muchas veces sobretodo en los estadios
6210579 cuando uno tiene un problema siempre me sacan a relucir cosas del pasado y siempre quieren mostrar que yo soy el malo y yo creo que una parte es uno y otra parte creo que es el color que uno carga encima porque sin lugar a dudas me hubieran juzgado diferente si hubiera tenido otro color

6210592 we predicted a tough environment this year and wecontinue to see it
6210593 we had a fairly volatile day given the peso opened muchhigher after global markets improved markedly but then thedollar started to firm abroad and the local market followed
6210594 there was also greater demand for dollars after somepension funds started to buy which put extra pressure on thepeso
6210595 estou surpreso mas feliz por representar uma grande na o realmente eu falei aquilo que gostaria de jogar no palmeiras mas foi porque eu j estava ambientado l j tinha havido uma primeira uma segunda e uma terceira conversa mas n o chegamos a um acordo nos valores pois ofereceram bem menos do que o corinthians ir pagar
6210596 gosto do corinthians da grandeza do corinthians e dessa na o trabalhando no dia a dia com certeza vou conquistar a confian a da torcida
6210597 costumo ter dor de cabe a quando n o tenho op es e n o quando tenho o morais atuou no jogo treino por 60 minutos conforme planejamos e vamos continuar observando j formamos uma base e vamos pensar nesta op o que ganhamos com a chegada de morais
6210598 iniciamos o ano com muitos volantes voc s jornalistas reclamaram muitos se preocuparam mas nos acertamos nesta posi o depois em um segundo momento trouxemos op es para a arma o jogadores mais ofensivos para completar o setor
6210599 foi um treinamento bom fiquei um pouco torto ali pois normalmente pego a bola por dentro mas o douglas e o dentinho vir o me ajudar pois sozinho encontrarei muitas dificuldades no geral o trabalho de hoje quarta foi bom no treinamento coletivo
6210600 jogador n o pode mais ficar preso s em uma posi o precisa ter essa flexibilidade alem disso s vou trocar o lado preciso correr bastante s que do lado esquerdo
6210601 um bom jogador mas ainda n o assinou contrato n o posso elogiar antes disso porque pode vir algum time e contratar
6210602 trata se de um jogador que fez um timo campeonato paulista tem boa defini o velocidade e for a f sica al m de um potencial de crescimento seria timo que ele assinasse o contrato para ser mais uma op o

6210605 quando vinha jogar com o vasco no pacaembu e a bola parava eu sempre olhava para os torcedores nas arquibancadas
6210606 what is the worst possible thing that could happen if i tell him im interested
6210607 ele foi muito bem assim como o restante dos jogadores
6210608 o herrera um grande jogador um grande profissional se o corinthians est fazendo essa proposta porque viu nele o que tem de bom j virou um dolo da torcida pela garra virou a cara do corinthians pois n o desiste nunca
6210609 falar em proje o a m dio ou longo prazo complicado pois dependemos de outros jogos n o quest o de ser politicamente correto e sim de ser certo temos que encarar jogo a jogo pois se pensarmos como um todo perdemos o foco no seguinte
6210610 em se tratando de corinthians uma fa sca um inc ndio procuramos manter a concentra o para passarmos ilesos independentemente do momento felizmente conseguimos terminar o primeiro turno da mesma forma que come amos

6210614 primeiro preciso bater o martelo e definir se o morumbi ser o est dio escolhido como ministra ouvi muito que o estado n o ir investir nas arenas para a copa mas a porta nunca est fechada a prefeitura ir procurar parcerias em v rias a es
6210615 um est dio para a copa do mundo precisa ter 65 mil lugares proximidade com hospitais de ponta e rede hoteleira n o h o que se questionar ou se faz uma arena para 65 mil lugares e n o h espa o para isso ou se faz os jogos no morumbi gostem ou n o gostem
6210616 o corinthians n o quer dinheiro p blico como o s o paulo quer apenas a desburocratiza o para acelerar o processo de constru o do seu est dio
6210617 tenho como ponto forte o cabeceio a jogada a rea e tamb m me considero bom na finaliza o
6210618 se o gr mio mantiver a mesma sorte em rela o a les es um advers rio forte ao lado do palmeiras e do cruzeiro quem tem mais chances de ganhar opinou
6210619 n o vou falar at para n o dar muni o aos nossos advers rios mas nosso ponto forte foi o equil brio entre gols marcados e sofridos
6210620 certamente a nica coisa que pesa contra ele isso pois est voltando ap s um longo tempo parado
6210621 ele j jogou como ala s que no esquema com tr s zagueiros n o com a linha de quatro como jogamos marcando de tr s ele ainda est voltando e pode sentir este ritmo
6210622 ik verlang al zo lang naar dit wereldrecord ik wist dat de baan snel is maar ik dacht dat dit onmogelijk zou zijn
6210623 een groot wiel doet er langer over om rond te gaan dan een klein wiel op de sprint werd dat altijd als nadeel beschouwd tot we deze jongen zien met de frequentie van iemand van 1 80 meter daarbij overbrugt hij per pas een centimeter of tien meer waardoor hij slechts 40 of 41 passen nodig heeft van start tot finish ik was zelf 1 75 meter en had 45 of 46 passen nodig over wiskunde valt niet te redetwisten
6210624 dit is vreselijk ik weet echt niet of ik buiten mijn baan terecht ben gekomen
6210625 dit is het ergste dat hem kan overkomen we kunnen niet eens in beroep tegen het besluit van de commissie

6210634 we zien dat steeds meer instellingen op het laatste moment nog proberen studenten te werven
6210635 maar de meesten hebben zich al ingeschreven wij adviseren scholieren om zich een jaar voor het begin van een studie te ori nteren dan is er meer tijd om je te verdiepen in de studie inhoud last minute keuzes zijn vaak niet zo goed doordacht genomen
6210636 ik kwam hier voor een antwoord en dat heb ik gekregen
6210637 het grote voordeel van de hogeschool leiden is de kleinschaligheid maar dat vind ik niet zo belangrijk het gaat mij om wat je kunt leren en niet om het contact met de docent stiekem denk ik dat het den haag wordt volgende week ga daar naar een voorlichtingsavond pas dan beslis ik definitief
6210638 ik wil iets met biologie doen maar weet nog niet precies welke kant ik op wil
6210639 dat was me toch net iets te theoretisch ik doe liever iets creatievers
6210640 een racebaan trekt ander publiek het zal onze toeristenindustrie benadelen dat weet ik zeker
6210641 wat als de racebaan wordt verdiept of overdekt dan vervallen veel bezwaren
6210642 wij zijn niet in de positie om dergelijke kansen zomaar voorbij te laten gaan
6210643 maar dan wil ik horen wat dat oplevert in zandvoort weten ze dat precies vier miljoen toeristen een besteding van 21 euro per persoon misschien dat een racecircuit eindelijk de duitse toerist van texel trekt
6210644 omdat bij jou nu pas de schellen van de ogen zijn gevallen
6210645 moet daarom nu iedereen die in die jaren actief was verantwoording gaan afleggen
6210646 wij zijn kennelijk niet meer in staat te begrijpen dat dergelijke acties bij een manier van politiek hoorden die eigen was aan links
6210647 productie hier productie daar ik had het gevoel dat ik werd geleefd losbreken uit dat productionele keurslijf was geen optie want tegelijkertijd was choreograferen het enige wat me echt deugd deed ik zat in een depressieve spagaat
6210648 als jongetje was ik gek op kungfu icoon bruce lee en het was vanuit die kinderlijke nieuwsgierigheid dat ik een kijkje in die tempel wilde nemen hoe leven die kungfu monniken cht het leek me een enorme contradictie je dagen doorbrengen met vechten en dan toch monnik zijn maar eenmaal in de tempel zag ik dat hun fysieke inspanning resulteerde in een bewonderenswaardige mentale rust de shaolinmonniken hebben de verbluffende gave om met kungfu de identiteit van dieren als kraanvogels en tijgers aan te nemen ze transformeren van warm naar koud gaan van yin naar yang en komen daarmee tot een complete identificatie met de wereld om zich heen
6210649 de monniken leven in de beslotenheid van een traditionele tempel maar het zijn ook gewoon jongens van negentien twintig jaar die naar popmuziek luisteren en op hun mobieltjes naar hun moeder bellen ik vond die binnen buitenwerking fascinerend alles maakt deel uit van het geheel waarmee ook alles volkomen wordt geaccepteerd het gaat de monniken erom te begrijpen hoe alles met elkaar verbonden is
6210650 prachtig hoe de monniken als een soort replica van elkaar unisono bewegen het deed me denken aan het werk van beeldend kunstenaar antony gormley die met themas als klonen en verdubbeling werkt toen ik hem vertelde over mijn plan om met de monniken een voorstelling te maken opperde hij het idee om met houten kisten te werken gormley zelf boeddhist zag de kisten als metafoor voor het zoeken naar de spirituele balans tussen vrijheid en beslotenheid van leven maar gezien de vorm van een doodskist ook van dood de volkomen vanzelfsprekende binnen buitenwerking waarmee ik in de tempel in aanraking was gekomen komt hierin fantastisch tot zijn recht sutra is een persoonlijk verslag van mijn verblijf in de tempel geworden
6210651 we waren direct erg enthousiast kungfu is heel levendig terwijl meditatie verstild en rustig is het is voor ons zaak om dat met elkaar in balans te brengen en balans bleek ook in de voorstelling een centraal gegeven
6210652 alleen al omdat we elke repetitiedag weer opnieuw moesten uitzoeken hoe de specifieke beweging van kungfu aan het gebruik van de kisten kon worden aangepast we moesten onze vertrouwde kungfu letterlijk in een ander kader zetten om een nieuwe balans te vinden
6210653 tijdens de repetities legde ik uit hoe ik de sc nes had bedacht aan de hand van op schaal gemaakte kistjes ik was een architect die steeds schoof met nieuwe vormen die rol heb ik ook in de voorstelling als een poortwachter die schuift en schakelt tussen de sc nes en ze samenbrengt als de blaadjes van een lotusbloem daar tegenover ben ik ook de westerse man degene die alleen staat in het collectief de outsider
6210654 de houten kisten vormen een collectief maar als je goed kijkt is elke kist weer anders door de volstrekt eigen tekening van nerf en knoest het collectief lijkt op het eerste gezicht onvrij omdat het is gedwongen samen te werken maar misschien schuilt in de collectieve beslotenheid wel de grootste vrijheid
6210655 dat zou nooit mogen kungfu staat voor intentie en kracht daar moeten wij alt jd voor honderd procent voor gaan zodra je wordt afgeleid boet de kungfu vorm aan kracht in en wordt de innerlijke balans verstoord
6210656 een kungfu monnik oefent een leven lang om in nog geen anderhalve minuut zijn kunsten te vertonen in die flits voltrekt zich zijn hele leven ik ben er trots op dat de intense kungfu dynamiek in sutra overeind is gebleven
6210657 ainda n o foi trabalhada nenhuma possibilidade acredito que o mano v quebrar um pouco a cabe a mas ele pago para isso ir trabalhar durante a semana e escolher a melhor forma o

6210677 senior mccain advisers and aides have told gop officials that mccain got the message last week that choosing a running mate who supports abortion rights would not be helpful
6210678 theyre just hoping for it because they know its not just a few loudmouths in the base they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case
6210679 its about finding a way to persuade mccain to make a decision that will guarantee his defeat
6210680 liberal republican on this particularly pro choice they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and pushed the conservative movement into the bleachers
6210681 mccain leads obama among likely u s voters by 46 percent to 41 percent wiping out obamas solid 7 point advantage in july and taking his first lead in the monthly reuters zogby poll

6210683 nbn is going to be a good thing for all equipment vendors we watch with intent as the debate plays out
6210684 the nbn architecture will likely be built very differently from the way dsl networks have been architected in the past
6210685 telstra has a much larger equipment and installed base so you could argue they dont need to invest as much whereas others will have to build out more

6210708 a few thousand of the absolutely most together and peaceful and loving and beautiful heads in the world are gathered in a grand tribal new beginning
6210709 it seems that the court is using africa as a test case to determine in what way international law can obtain more legitimacy on the ground in africa
6210710 the icc focuses on economically weak and politically vulnerable countries and on nations that are not able or willing to try perpetrators of crimes against humanity many african countries fulfill these criteria
6210711 we need to ask ourselves whether retribution is a sufficient deterrent to those who violate human rights is intervention by the icc enough to stop crimes against humanity and war crimes in africa and elsewhere in the world
6210712 the court should hold all tyrants accountable but this is not happening so far most of the indictees are african the powerful the united states instance will never be put on trial
6210713 russia will probably not be tried for what is happening in georgia and the same counts for china
6210714 should we prosecute mugabe despite the possibility this could increase the chance of further deterioration of the situation in zimbabwe or should we give him the chance to walk off if this would contribute a more stabile peace situation
6210715 i am not too much against the former if this will bring peace and stability to zimbabwe
6210716 the icc is not an experiment the court is permanent and is here to stay and does not treat any part of the world as a test case
6210717 the fact is that africa played an incredible role in the establishment of the court
6210718 the situations the icc is investigating at the moment were put forward by the party states themselves except for darfur which was referred to the icc by the uns security council it is therefore untrue that the court is only targeting africa as the office of the prosecutor has publicly announced that his office is monitoring situations in other parts of the world in colombia for instance and afghanistan
6210719 we have been assuming that the ways in which emotions are organized in the brain are essentially similar in men and women

6210722 the orbitofrontal cortex ofc is the main modulator of amygdala action
6210723 so if you are at a party and someone insults you the amygdala which is a very primitive and old structure in human brains will be yelling kill the guy
6210724 women excel in something called verbal fluency or being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6210725 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6210726 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6210727 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6210728 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 percent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction
6210729 buy them some time and allow them to emerge from the crisis and rebuild
6210730 it would seem to me that this was an important fact if senator obama is truly going to bring transparency to washington this is surely no way to do it
6210731 this is yet another indication of the inexperience that senator obama has in conducting foreign policy and may be an indication of his ability to do so in a way that would be responsible which is of course the point that senator clinton made when senator obama said he would negotiate with some of these people without preconditions
6210732 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government
6210733 the greatest tests of national security judgment in the last decade have been what do you do about iraq and what do you do about afghanistan
6210734 and john mccain failed both of those two tests he was part of the group who wanted to go into iraq from the beginning

6210745 we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia
6210746 president medvedev told president sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded by aug 21 22 except for 500 troops in charge of implementing additional security measures stipulated in article 5 of the aug 12 accord
6210747 president medvedev also confirmed his agreement to the presence of observers from the osce who will cooperate with the patrols in the temporary security zone
6210748 please look at me so you can understand the pain you caused
6210749 what you have done has affected every aspect of my life i tend to stay indoors im afraid of people like you out on the streets
6210750 i hope someday you can forgive yourself because i cant
6210751 i dont believe you have sympathy for those you killed
6210752 if there was a sentence known as forever in state prison i would give it to you
6210753 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6210754 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6210755 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6210756 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6210757 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us

6210862 real weight loss a practical guide to changing your lifestyle and achieving long term weight loss
6210863 when i finally came to my senses and realised i needed to do something about being overweight i found myself surrounded by a weight loss industry peddling nonsense solutions focussed on short term weight loss rather than long term lifestyle change
6210864 i felt there was a need for a common sense book focussed on health with understandable science in it
6210865 this is not a programme and it does not contain the d word diet its all about five key principles as to how you can live well eat nutritious food and slowly lose weight
6210866 look lifestyle change is difficult but its nearly impossible with the unrealistic timeframes people generally set themselves most people who are successful with long term weight loss devise their own programme but for those who want a step by step guide there is an appendix to the book which takes you through the next 2000 days

6210940 while our business is strong in many markets issues at a major customer have caused orders from this customer to be lower than expected in the fourth quarter and into the second quarter of our 2009 fiscal year accordingly we are reducing our financial targets for the quarter and the year we are also taking the necessary steps to control costs including workforce reductions as we continue to closely monitor the financial and operational status of the major customer
6210941 even excluding orders for this customer our business looks strong for fiscal 2009 we are working hard to deliver profitability in 2009 based on business in hand and we believe that our cost cutting efforts will make this possible while not jeopardizing our ability to grow the business or invest in new product development

6210988 this is a landmark achievement for the inland feeder a vital link in securing a more reliable higher quality water supply for southern californians
6210989 southern california is facing increasingly limited periods of time when water is accessible in northern california and can be delivered to our region
6210990 so when water is available we must be prepared to move large volumes of water during a relatively short time and then store it for use during dry periods and emergencies
6210991 history shows that changes in climate and weather are inevitable bringing significant uncertainties in our climate and our water demands
6210992 projects like the inland feeder will help accommodate the inevitable changes in climate and weather that our region will experience by understanding our climate past and carefully considering our climate future we have made a thoughtful prudent investment in our future
6210993 construction of the arrowhead west and east tunnels was challenging not only due to the physical constraints of mining in such extremely difficult geologic conditions and so close to several earthquake faults but also because of other hazards unique to southern california that were encountered fires and flash floods

6211009 the judge agreed with our evidence that patients would suffer if the payment cuts were allowed to stand
6211010 we presented compelling evidence that many family physicians would be unable to continue seeing medi cal patients
6211011 because the department of health care services medi cal payments already were far below the costs of providing care the cut would have forced many family physicians to close their practices to new medi cal patients
6211012 as advocates for our patients and for the publics health we just could not stand by and watch patients access to care deteriorate even further than it already has
6211013 when family physicians are forced for economic reasons to stop seeing medi cal patients there is an impact on quality of life and cost of care
6211014 patients often delay seeking care and when they absolutely must see a doctor they end up in already overburdened emergency rooms where care is more expensive and follow up care cant be tracked the public health of california depends on people staying as well as possible and when ill being treated promptly primary care doctors including family physicians are the first line of defense against declining public health and escalating epidemics like obesity diabetes and heart disease the courts decision keeps this critical public health element in place

6211150 although it saddens me to leave the chapter a change of course in my professional career has made this difficult decision necessary however without question i leave the chapter in extremely capable hands with ann storberg as its new president supported by a highly talented board of directors ann has demonstrated exceptional leadership since joining the virtual chapters board three years ago serving as the programs committee chair and chapter treasurer i have greatly enjoyed my half decade of service to the virtual chapter and remain available to contribute to its future success when and where appropriate
6211151 we appreciate all the years of service lenny has provided the niri virtual chapter playing an important role in making it the success it is today
6211152 while were disappointed to see him leave i am personally very excited to take on the challenge of chapter president and look forward to showcasing all the programs and professional development initiatives we have planned for the 2008 2009 year including the expansion of the virtual ally program as well as the virtual chapters online community in doing so we expect to further the growth of the chapter and provide our members with more resources to better their development than ever before

6211167 with 80 to 90 percent of new products disappearing from store shelves within a year the success rates of launches have gone virtually unchanged for the past 30 years
6211168 its time to change those statistics the current economic environment will be even less forgiving of missteps in new product launches but we are confident that with the ability to quickly course correct taking such measures as adjusting distribution based on sku popularity iri can help manufacturers achieve success with their new products
6211169 iri understands how critical it is for manufacturers to operate more efficiently during this difficult economic climate
6211170 by quickly alerting them to key problems and opportunities and giving them the ability to make major adjustments before it is too late we will help clients avoid the costly failures of products which have inherent potential no longer will reads that come too late for action prevent high quality brands from succeeding

6211215 you dont want to get a label as an injury prone guy the tough thing for him is a lot of them have been legitimate injuries sometimes there is just nothing you can do about that thats part of the game maybe this is the last one and hell go on a 15 year streak and never get hurt again you really dont know

6211222 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6211223 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6211224 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6211225 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws

6211228 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6211229 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6211230 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6211231 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6211232 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6211233 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid

6211266 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6211267 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6211268 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6211269 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6211270 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6211271 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6211272 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6211273 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6211274 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6211275 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6211276 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6211277 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6211278 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes
6211279 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6211280 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6211281 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6211282 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6211283 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility

6211288 we used to be able to have students in there for just a period of about two weeks while we found them further more permanent accommodation
6211289 but were having a lot of trouble moving those students into accommodation because the rental costs are so high and the vacancy rate so low
6211290 we have five people in a four bedroom house the rent for the house is about 550
6211291 my room is about 2 5 three metres for two people which gets filled up very quickly with desk beds et cetera
6211292 one of our flatmates also pays 130 and she lives in a room thats about 1 8 by 2 1metres
6211293 and all she can fit in is really a desk a single bed and just her clothes and shes on centrelink australias welfare agency but and she has to work cash in hand to be able to afford to pay the rent and pay the bills
6211294 the disadvantage of centrelink is the cap is too low for students the work how much you can earn per week
6211295 so it forces students into cash in hand jobs where they dont get the rights and protection they really need
6211296 yes it was really lucky that we got it and the previous tenants hadnt moved out and the real estate agent was desperate and it was in really bad shape
6211297 there were cockroaches all through the kitchen and there was an infestation problem and stains and holes and everything
6211298 the problem is theres just not really enough rental properties and rental prices are skyrocketing
6211299 a lot of students are low income earners and many receive welfare and its very hard to get affordable rental properties when youre on centrelink
6211300 it is very important that we ensure the public has a reasonable amount of time to provide input on our proposed changes to school board governance

6211326 global retail is experiencing an explosive modernization as investment rushes into developing markets as the wealthiest markets mature more retailers are pursuing new growth opportunities retailers that can identify the most promising markets will become fierce global competitors able to saturate the obvious markets and gain first mover advantage in new ones
6211327 russian retail sales reached approximately us 318 billion last year 2006 this has made russia the second most lucrative and twelfth largest retail market throughout the globe
6211328 exceeded 1 billion in sales in russia alone with the latest annual growth rates of 20 30 percent
6211329 local retailers are experimenting with new formats and are growing rapidly consumers are getting richer all this makes russia very very attractive to us
6211330 russia will create more new shopping center space during the second half of 2007 and all of 2008 than any other country in europe
6211331 development has really taken off across the russian regions this year with quality developers such as bv development and the regions rolling out shopping centers to up the stakes in the major regional cities
6211332 where until 2004 and largely 2005 the growth model was based on an accelerated extraction of natural resources primarily hydrocarbons in recent years the structure and sources of growth have absolutely changed exports including the exports of hydrocarbons have ceased to be the main motive force of economic development being supplanted by investment demand and the end household demand

6211340 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6211341 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6211342 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc
6211343 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6211344 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns

6211346 we set our stall out to get something from the game as our performances and results in qualifying games away from home have not been good
6211347 we set out a blueprint to get points away from home and the players worked hard passed well and were resilient
6211348 we had to change our shape when we were reduced to 10 men and i thought ryan mcgiverns red card was harsh
6211349 considering that we had four or five key players missing the players that came in did very well and that is refreshing
6211350 we are under no illusions about the task we face in our first qualifier against slovakia in bratislava but if we go there with the right attitude and discipline and keep our shape then we can get a result
6211351 wanted us to come away from home and dig in
6211352 we could have won but craig gordon saved my penalty which he is good at
6211353 we came here to do a job as nigel wanted us to change our formation so that we are a bit more defensive away from home and can pick up points
6211354 i applaud dr yokel and his research team for earning such a prestigious award
6211355 it is an honor that the epa star program selected uk for the largest single grant it has ever awarded for nanotechnology research this award is a perfect example of why it is so important that kentucky has a world class research university as it shows that the leading faculty and researchers that we have been able to recruit and retain here at uk are among the best in the world

6211490 i have had the opportunity to get to know regy on a personal level over the past two summers when he came up to coach the ontario lacrosse asociations six nations arrows express
6211491 his personal commitment and dedication to our team went a long way to showing me what type of a person regy really is he led the arrows express to the national championship last year and to provincial finals again this year
6211492 as you all know regy has been symbolic with the rochester knighthawks
6211493 i look forward to helping the coaches get the personnel needed to win here in rochester and working with the players to take things off their plates so their main focus is lacrosse i am also committed to assisting the management and staff to meet their budget requirements in order to run a healthy organization not only for this season but for years to come

6211497 it is the most natural sounding reverb i have ever heard
6211498 all fop field of play speakers needed to be self powered arrays due to highly restrictive physical space limitations
6211499 in the case of the jbl products i needed small size and a lot of spl not to mention predictable coverage the jbl vertec dp systems performed flawlessly exceeding my requirements and expectations overall the venue sound for the event was excellent with an in your face direct sound characteristic throughout the audience area we achieved excellent acoustic isolation from zone to zone with zero intelligibility problems the result was very very good for all concerned

6211502 well yes being transported is a great thing that is unless you are at the gate at the st louis airport and there is suddenly an announcement over the loud speaker
6211503 will miss please board the aircraft immediately the plane is scheduled to depart in two minutes
6211504 mama i looked up and the entire gate was empty i hadnt even heard the boarding call i hadnt seen anyone get up i was very very very transported and i almost missed my flight
6211505 tonight i cant miss this is perfectly beautiful surely the picture will show it

6211508 the philips device indicated that the channels were already occupied prior to the mics being turned on turning on the mics essentially made no change in the display on the other hand the i2r devices initial sweep indicated that the channels were open then when the mics were turned on it would not detect them in almost all test locations both devices showed no change between the mics being on or off
6211509 the bottom line on this thing is that there was nothing unexpected from our perspective the philips device reached a decision in every case that wouldnt interfere with wireless mics and in no case did it say a channel was vacant when a device was on it
6211510 i live here on less than a dollar a month

6211520 my late goal salvaged some pride you know most of the boys played on sunday were disappointed we didnt win it though but they were a good side
6211521 we would have liked to play better but at least we havent been beaten
6211522 well yea im a winger but the manager wanted me to play off the front man it was a difficult game weve got a new manager weve got to try things new tactics and all that
6211523 we played the first half well lot of chances and we scored im happy we played a long time for an hour hour and fifteen minutes how i liked to play
6211524 i learnt that when the other team counter attacks we have problems we have just started the season though not every player are at the top physically
6211525 this is not an easy team to play against the character i liked though i saw enough to encourage me some moments of good football but the czech were hard a very strong team
6211526 i am a friend of brian and also the chairman but it is not my job to talk
6211527 overall we expected a little bit more there is a long way to go some plusses but also some negatives we will have to study with the premier league coming up the manager will see more players
6211528 we fielded a strong side and probably should have won we have moved forward its been a slow process it was a nothing game today we dont get any points its all about the qualification then we need to score points we will have to put on a better show for the fans because they have travelled a long way and paid good money
6211529 its been a problem for the past four or five years we need to address our form on the international stage we struggle to click or play together it will take time though
6211530 the battle droids all sound like erkle from family matters

6211537 its sad things didnt work out john thinks the world of jen
6211538 i dont think that life is short so i think you should stop saying that life is short man no its not life is excrusiatingly long let me rephrase that the life you got left is excrusiatingly long the life behind you its done so yeah life is short but only when you turn around and look at it but if you keep looking forward you got a lot of yearsto think about if you dont think life is long if you life every day like life is short you know what you become a fuckin asshole you gotta live your life like someday soon youre gonna hit some miserable tuesday night thats just gonna seem to go on for days and days and days waiting for either some phone call to come that doesnt come or some phone call to stop that wont stop because as its laid out infront of you seems to go on forever but look back to when you were 4 and it seems like last sunday so just keep looking forward and keep your good heart on you and keep doing the best you can do and love who you love the best you can love

6211559 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6211560 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6211561 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6211562 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6211563 the fact that they re even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because they ve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6211603 it seemed like overnight the impact was terrible we were hastening the demise of this arch exponentially
6211604 its like a lot of things a few bad apples ruin it for everyone
6211605 we were doing the damage in a restricted area to keep the damage from being done in a much wider area its not a perfect solution but its the best we could do the main goal was to protect the arch
6211606 one four wheeler can do more damage than a hundred horses or mountain bikes

6211627 we have never cut this amount off of a budget without taxing in anyones memory we have never gone into the budget and made these types of cuts in an election year and weve never gone into the budget in august
6211628 he has accomplished what my records have showed has been unprecedented in this state never has a governor brought leaders back to the table during an election year and make cuts where they needed to be made the people of the state should be very proud of our governor as i am and im sure the rest of the leaders are this is a step in the right direction

6211637 the digital divide is not a failure of the market individual broadband needs vary enough that universal service cannot be guaranteed by pervasive infrastructure the market already has demonstrated that private capital exists for infrastructure development enlightened policy seeks to create a climate that welcomes that investment so far weve seen that this is best accomplished by avoid ing attempts at government funded centralized infrastructure planning engaging all segments of the broadband industry and energizing leadership at the state and local level

6211641 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6211642 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6211643 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 percent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction

6211648 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6211649 but it is even more important to have friends who share your hopes and aspirations and dreams and poland and the united states are those kinds of friends
6211650 nobody has the right to tell poland what to do those times have passed
6211651 they feel that poland is one of their territories and poland is entering their field
6211652 its in polands interest to stay on the american radar to be seen from washington and if we are ever in trouble to hope at least for american support

6211661 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6211662 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes

6211664 our proposed research will address some of the deepest questions in computer science
6211665 most people dont realize that e commerce rests upon cryptosystems which in turn rest upon problems that we assume are intractable and cannot be decrypted
6211666 but is this true every time you do an e commerce transaction how do you know that that hasnt been exposed to everybody else in the world understanding intractability will help better guide computer security efforts
6211667 in quantum computing and in other areas our model of nature seems to suggest that nature is solving intractable problems
6211668 we dont know whether this is a problem with our model or whether nature is doing something which we do not understand
6211669 there is a big open question as to whether the problems that we believe are intractable actually are if we discover that all of these problems that we think are hard are not hard that would be an earth shattering discovery its hard to think of any other scientific breakthrough that would have more impact today

6211721 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function suitably or properly on the 3g network but thus far apple and the phone have failed to deliver on this promise
6211722 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones
6211723 my calls get dropped a lot and im not even moving one inch anywhere

6211725 first he wanted us to tie her up and take her to his house so she could be beaten over there first then he was figuring a way with acid whether he could get rid of the body but he mentioned his garage drain was too small

6211727 in this instance at a minimum we can say these two botnets are actually using the same carrier for their updates
6211728 they are not one in the same although they have some overlap if you take down one the other will continue to persist
6211729 that service may spam the emails to put the software on peoples computers
6211730 we found in data mining sample last fall a trojan dropper that had downloaded seven different binaries among them was storm and srizbi
6211731 what is confusing people is that youre seeing rustock bots sending out emails that essentially infect people with srizbi so they think it must be srizbi thats sending it but its not
6211732 srizbi is not just one big model its rented out to lots of different spammers
6211733 it could be because they want to separate their malware seeding operation from their spamming operation
6211734 maybe their bots are getting blacklisted faster when theyre sending out urls with fake video files because theyre easy to spot so their spam doesnt get through so they send malware from this botnet and spam from this one to keep out of the blacklists longer
6211735 microsoft is under tremendous market pressure from customers to enable interoperability with open source solutions their partnership with novell enables them to accomplish that within the framework of what microsoft views as appropriate intellectual property practices
6211736 if you look at the two fastest server operating systems youll see windows and linux microsoft figures there is going to be so much linux in use it had better get involved
6211737 theres a lot of linux out there much more than microsoft generally signals publicly and their customers are using it so its important that microsoft have a good interoperability story on that front linking up with a linux vendor is a good way to do that
6211738 novell is a relatively weak player in the linux market and therefore more malleable they also have a good partner channel and partners tend to be more opportunistic than vendors themselves so microsoft could realize some incidental sales through that channel
6211739 time has indicated that this partnership is good for both companies
6211740 novell has received a healthy boost in its linux revenue thanks in large part to the microsoft suse linux subscriptions both companies have leveraged the linux windows harmony story to gain significant new customers microsoft has managed to attach its name and potentially software to enterprise linux adoption
6211741 microsoft gains more indirectly as it enables them to pursue interoperability within their ip framework approach overall however microsoft gains more since this helps them shore up their formidable revenue base which dwarfs novells
6211742 customers win two ways for those that work with novell this is good since technical interoperability and direct partnership help them use novell better other open source companies customers also benefit since much of the work done in collaboration between novell and microsoft also applies to other open source products
6211743 customers are pretty much the reason for this so they do end up winning and not just novell microsoft customers but linux windows and multi os users too
6211744 whats key to this relationship is that to take advantage of it customers must be using or considering microsoft software
6211745 so microsoft learns about some of the challenges that customers face what workloads theyre using linux for and which theyre using microsoft for
6211746 while you can get numbers for the number of servers that go out with linux on them or red hats license revenues a great many customers simply download the product and in many cases install it multiple times

6211759 oops the compound x was contaminated it turns out superconducting temperature for high quality crystal is z not y
6211760 here we present ab initio calculations that demonstrate that compound x must have superconducting temperature z rather than y
6211761 at pressures of x terrapascals hydrogen will become both superconducting and superfluid and since nobody will ever reach those pressures in the lab or at least not in our lifetimes you just have to take our word for it

6211776 the majority of commentators here seem to have very little knowledge of zimbabwe and its politics if you only rely on information provided to you by the opposition you are getting only a quarter of the picture
6211777 we dont want it to be zimbabwe versus britain its zimbabwe versus the world
6211778 founded the study of eugenics and the theory of anticyclones
6211779 is to make the encouragement of chinese settlements of africa a part of our national policy in the belief that the chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior negro race i should expect that the african seaboard now sparsely occupied by lazy palavering savages might in a few years be tenanted by industrious order loving chinese living either as a semi detached dependency of china or else in perfect freedom under their own law
6211780 how china is taking over africa and why we in the west should be very worried
6211781 we dont want it to be zimbabwe versus britain its zimbabwe versus the world
6211782 the loss of life in such blighted places as sudans darfur province and somalia is still many times higher than in zimbabwe

6211791 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6211792 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6211793 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6211794 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6211795 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6211796 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6211797 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6211798 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6211799 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6211800 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests

6211808 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
6211809 if you can find things that explode you can also find things that move but you need different tools to look for them
6211810 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
6211811 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
6211812 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
6211813 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
6211814 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
6211815 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed

6211825 chris has years of experience working for ctio he has led a major southern sky survey of the magellanic clouds and he recently headed the noao wide data products program during a period of extensive developments in virtual observatories
6211826 i am confident he will excel in this new role as an observatory director
6211827 i thank alistair for his excellent service as ctio director during an exciting era when the dark energy camera project for the blanco 4 meter telescope was born and the large synoptic survey telescope project chose a peak within the aura compound in chile for its future site
6211828 alistair has left the observatory extremely well positioned for the coming years
6211829 ctio is a cornerstone of both the future of noao and more generally the future of u s astronomy the facilities available today at ctio soar and gemini and the promise of the exciting next generation of facilities located in chile including alma lsst and gsmt are a magnificent combination
6211830 i look forward to building upon the strong foundation and excellent staff we have in chile to take full advantage of the exciting scientific opportunities the future holds

6211832 a quality audience evaluation is evidence that our customized interactive video programs are relevant to the needs of todays classrooms
6211833 in order to really get at the issue is there life out there we have to know the best place to look
6211834 and in the case of europa the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today
6211835 this research feeds that need that i have as a geologist and as a person to be the explorer to be the adventurer to see things that no one else has seen before and figure out things that no one else has figured out before
6211836 and out in the solar system is a great place to do that because there are some things like the plumes on enceladus that we really are seeing for the very first time
6211837 europa has the potential for something very similar to hydrothermal systems we have here in our oceans
6211838 very ancient organisms that thrive on oxidized metals potentially could be centered on one of these oases formed by heat and metals seeping from cracks in the ocean floor
6211839 we dont walk around on earth with our eyes closed we want to know whats going on why things happen
6211840 its like galileo looking through his telescope all those centuries ago and going gosh whats out there its that same spirit of exploration and i just get a real kick out of that
6211841 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6211842 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6211843 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6211844 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small
6211845 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity

6211851 i got away from the whole professional look of putting the camera on a tripod and having perfectly level horizons and perfect composition and perfect lighting where it looks like it was shot on a sound stage into more of the mtv or gonzo style
6211852 im really a stickler for sharpness i have an eye for composition and lighting you just dont have to make it look like youre trying to win a directors guild award you can still be amateur or pro am and have professional standards
6211853 we made the decision a long time ago to have safe sex as a producer i feel some kind of social responsibility for the content i put out
6211854 a lot of young men see our videos and i dont want to give them the impression that barebacking is ok that overall trend has had a negative effect on the business its especially bad in the twink niche studios are exploiting the na vet of the young men who arent old enough or maybe educated enough to understand the risks theres some exploitation going on there which i think is sad
6211855 some of the studios are using guys that are purposely made to look very young almost like theyre not adults that troubles me a lot and thats a trend im glad we dont do
6211856 there are even studios out there that have gone beyond the whole barely legal look and have gone into the barely male look boys who look like theyre one step away from the surgery
6211857 what i cater to are the people who appreciate the diversity and the sensuality of young men in all their flavors
6211858 i dont do a whole lot of set ups and scripting but i try to do just enough set up or dialogue so the viewer can buy into the scenario once theyve done that their imagination takes over its more enjoyable to them if it looks believable
6211859 i was beginning to feel i was the susan lucci of gay porn
6211860 i just suddenly find myself up to my ass in big dicks
6211861 ive been around 10 years in the twink business and so many people have come in and out of it
6211862 ive managed to stay independent and build a respected company without having to compromise my personal ethics i havent had to kiss anybodys ass or sell out to anybody or gone into barebacking after 10 years i think thats an accomplishment
6211863 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
6211864 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
6211865 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
6211866 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
6211867 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
6211868 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
6211869 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you

6211928 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6211929 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6211930 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6211931 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6211932 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6211933 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6211934 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6211935 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6211936 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6211937 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6211938 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6211939 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6211940 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6211941 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6211942 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6211943 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6211944 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6211945 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

6211948 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6211949 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6211950 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6211951 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6211952 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6211953 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6211954 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6211955 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6211956 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6211957 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6211958 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6211959 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6211960 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6211961 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6211962 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6211963 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6211964 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6211965 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6211966 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6211967 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6211968 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6211969 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6211970 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6211971 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6211972 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6211973 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6211974 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6211975 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6211976 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6211977 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6211978 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6211979 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6211980 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6211981 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6211982 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6211983 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6211984 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6211985 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6211986 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6211987 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6211988 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6211989 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6211990 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6211991 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6211992 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6211993 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6211994 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6211995 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6211996 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6211997 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6211998 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6211999 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6212000 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6212001 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6212002 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6212003 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6212004 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6212005 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6212006 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6212007 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6212008 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6212009 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6212010 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6212011 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6212012 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6212013 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6212014 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6212015 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6212016 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6212017 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
6212018 andy got angry and started yelling what are you doing
6212019 the crowd was trying to hold back the groom from mouthing off more but finally he broke free and they had to take him down
6212020 he was heading for the officers then the bride moved in and tried to interfere
6212021 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6212022 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6212023 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6212024 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6212025 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6212026 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6212027 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6212028 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6212029 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6212030 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6212031 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6212032 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6212033 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6212034 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6212035 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6212036 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6212037 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6212038 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6212039 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6212040 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6212041 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6212042 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6212043 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6212044 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6212045 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6212046 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6212047 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6212048 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6212049 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6212050 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6212051 from a financial standpoint venezuela contributes less than 4 of the companys annual ebitda
6212052 assets wise supposing the purchase is for us 500mn local operations only represent 1 of cemexs total
6212053 the us 1 3bn figure was given by the venezuelan vice president ram n carrizales who said that was the amount cemex was asking for its facilities
6212054 we do not know whether that is true or not cemex issued a very succinct release which did not provide any figures or details all it said was that the takeover had been made effective

6212057 i thought he was going to follow it up with a little laugh or something but he didnt
6212058 he was quite serious and i said okay he said you know your comments were really damaging and i said yeah but they were really true and he said no they werent and i said of course they were and i started to walk away knowing that the conversation wasnt going to go anywhere
6212059 i got maybe 10 feet away and he said no come on i want to talk to you about it i hesitated but thought maybe well resolve this once and for all i went back he said something im not sure what he said and i said something like twelve years later were still trying to clean up the mess you idiots made and that was when he punched me it was over before i even knew what happened i didnt know someone could hit someone so fast
6212060 but once he got out on the board he absolutely loved it
6212061 but when he was in the water his bad behavior got a little bit better i know that it balances the kids out i know its more than just fun and extreme sport
6212062 the waves the waves are big enough and the waves are like woosh
6212063 this is awesome this is what every mother dreams of who has an autistic child for their child to be able to do things like this this is awesome
6212064 and as you can see those lifeguard surfer guys are so cool
6212065 helping one person makes you feel so good well 150 children and its really its a rush
6212066 i aint smart ill never find a cure but i know today tomorrow i can take a bunch of autistic kids out surfing and have a wonderful time
6212067 during the course of the audit the examination staff noted that we regularly communicate with portfolio managers at other hedge funds about investment and trading ideas
6212068 the sec later informed us that it had commenced a formal investigation of third point primarily relating to these types of communications
6212069 a chorus of blame the shorts is generally an excellent indicator of significant underlying problems

6212076 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6212077 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6212078 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6212079 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6212080 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6212081 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6212082 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6212083 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6212084 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6212085 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6212086 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6212087 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6212088 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6212089 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6212090 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6212091 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6212092 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6212093 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6212094 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6212095 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6212096 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6212097 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6212098 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6212099 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6212100 in the long term saxo bank plans to expand its activities in important financial centers in this strategy s o paulo would probably be a target for that expansion
6212101 s o paulo is for us viewed as the major one and its the biggest in south america
6212102 right now in latin america we have no white label partnerships because were still going through the due diligence in some of the latin american countries
6212103 right now our main focus is not that kind of business we are contacting institutions and focusing on business to business relationships not something that would go towards retail clients or final clients that is not our intention in brazil
6212104 its basically providing companies here in brazil such as investment funds or banks with instruments to trade the products we offer
6212105 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6212106 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6212107 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6212108 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6212109 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6212110 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6212111 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6212112 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6212113 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6212123 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6212124 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6212125 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6212126 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6212127 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6212128 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6212129 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6212130 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6212131 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6212132 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6212133 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6212134 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6212135 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6212136 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6212137 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6212138 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6212139 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6212140 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6212141 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6212142 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6212143 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6212144 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6212145 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6212146 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6212147 if you ask me are we going to move out of algeria well no because we are an algerian company

6212155 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6212156 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6212157 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6212158 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6212159 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6212186 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6212187 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6212188 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6212189 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6212190 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6212191 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6212192 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6212193 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6212194 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6212195 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
6212196 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6212197 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6212198 the death is in fact related to the outbreak weve just had that confirmed
6212199 i dont have any personal specs about the death at all
6212200 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6212201 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility this involves people we want people to understand theres a recall we want people to have that information
6212202 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6212203 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6212204 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6212205 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6212224 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6212225 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6212226 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6212227 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6212228 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6212229 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6212230 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6212231 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6212232 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6212233 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6212234 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6212235 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6212236 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6212237 my decision to step down should not come as a surprise to anyone given that im now 85 years old
6212238 i have been so proud to be associated with gray since 1993
6212239 i am also extremely pleased that hilton howell has agreed to his increased responsibility with gray television
6212240 his appointment as chief executive officer shows that our family will continue to have a strong interest in and commitment to gray television well into the future
6212241 alpha center had the same right to advertise as any other organization
6212242 we started the game well but got too complacent and it backfired when aho made the mistake
6212243 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but i feel im ready for a new challenge
6212244 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6212245 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6212246 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6212247 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6212248 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6212249 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6212250 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6212251 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6212252 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6212253 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6212254 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6212255 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6212256 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6212257 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6212258 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6212259 we appreciate all that fernando has done for this team over the last four years and wish him and his family the best
6212260 he has worked tirelessly on behalf of our organization and brought us some of our greatest successes we are poised to achieve great things and when we do we will look back fondly and appreciatively of fernandos tenure with our club

6212265 the diamond market has seen little to no change in the u s dollar price for small to medium sized diamonds whilst the brazilian currency measured against the u s dollar has appreciated considerably
6212266 despite our share price performance amazon retains a strong treasury and a demonstrable ability to identify noteworthy opportunities in brazil
6212267 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6212268 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6212269 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

6212275 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6212276 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6212277 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6212278 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6212279 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6212280 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6212281 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6212282 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6212283 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6212284 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6212285 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6212286 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6212287 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6212288 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6212289 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6212290 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6212291 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6212292 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6212293 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6212294 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6212295 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

6212297 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6212306 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6212307 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6212308 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning

6212310 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6212312 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6212313 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6212314 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6212315 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6212316 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6212317 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6212318 this is a planning took where all things are going
6212319 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

6212324 i had a bookshop in africa at the foot of the ngong hills
6212325 authors as a class are not men who like to work just as according to shakespeare snails creep unwillingly to school so do writers of wholesome fiction slow up as they approach their desks i myself have probably sharpened as many pencils and cleaned out as many pipes before getting down to it as any man in the business
6212326 they laughed at louis armstrong when he said he was going to the moon and now hes up there laughing at them
6212327 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6212328 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6212329 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6212330 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6212331 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6212332 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6212333 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6212334 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6212335 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6212336 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them

6212341 cbs reynolds made mccains disdain seem reasonable characterizing it as being directed towards obamas assessment of iran as a tiny threat the paraphrase of obama by nbcs cowan was less tendentious saying that iran poses only a tiny threat compared with that of the former soviet union abcs wright used a formulation the threat posed by iran is not as serious as once posed by the former soviet union that was so reasonable that it made mccain appear to be the one whose judgment was unhinged
6212342 media coverage tends to be more positive when candidates are winning and obama did of course manage to defeat hillary clinton the report does not include stories since he opened the general election battle against john mccain but other studies have found that obama consistently gets more coverage than his republican rival
6212343 we set our stall out to get something from the game as our performances and results in qualifying games away from home have not been good
6212344 we set out a blueprint to get points away from home and the players worked hard passed well and were resilient
6212345 we had to change our shape when we were reduced to 10 men and i thought ryan mcgiverns red card was harsh
6212346 considering that we had four or five key players missing the players that came in did very well and that is refreshing
6212347 we are under no illusions about the task we face in our first qualifier against slovakia in bratislava but if we go there with the right attitude and discipline and keep our shape then we can get a result
6212348 wanted us to come away from home and dig in
6212349 we could have won but craig gordon saved my penalty which he is good at

6212359 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6212360 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year

6212375 aurora has experienced significant growth in recent years growing too in the number of families in need of health care for their children
6212376 while health insurance coverage is one of the strongest predictors of whether children have access to health care even insured children arent guaranteed access to affordable appropriate high quality care the new clinic will provide students enrolled at crawford elementary and nine nearby schools the opportunity to more easily access and afford medical dental and mental health services
6212377 we know that children who lack access to quality health care are far more likely to miss school are less ready to learn and are more likely to go to the emergency room for treatable conditions such as asthma attacks or ear infections
6212378 its heartening to know that the rocky mountain youth clinics are providing a familiar accessible way for families to make sure that their children receive immunizations have access to primary and preventive health care and improved referrals to specialized care for complicated illnesses in turn these children are likely to have better school attendance and academic performance levels

6212389 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
6212390 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
6212391 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
6212392 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
6212393 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
6212394 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
6212395 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
6212396 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
6212397 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados

6212410 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6212411 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6212412 one of reasons we created babyfirsttv is that we thought there was no good programming for babies on tv and according to the research that is out there most of the babies are watching tv anyway
6212413 we felt anything we could do to improve safety for students and faculty we should do
6212414 are we safer because of all this technology thats hard to say but safety is and always has been the number one question on the minds of parents dropping off their children in the fall
6212415 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong
6212416 considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected

6212426 to succeed you need four things smart people smart ideas an investment in innovation and the right environment to bring this together
6212427 it starts with teachers its not about throwing money at the problem its about throwing good qualified people at it and giving them the resources to solve the problem
6212428 it was a difficult night playing against a good team early on in the season and most of us played on sunday
6212429 it was a tough game but we got a good draw against a good side but we are disappointed not to have won
6212430 but we havent been beaten we are building our confidence and getting stronger
6212431 im a winger but the manager wanted me to play off the frontman
6212432 new manager and new ideas weve got to try things
6212433 we played very well in the first half we had a lot of chances to score
6212434 im happy because we played for a long time for an hour good i liked it
6212435 but the czech counter attack was very dangerous and we need to work on that
6212436 i learned things that when the other team counter attack we have problems
6212437 we are just starting the season and some players are not at the top physically and im sure in the next game we will be better but im happy that we played better
6212438 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6212439 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future
6212440 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6212441 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible
6212442 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6212443 is it a problem for players returning we have become used to confronting the challenges sometimes everything has gone well other times not so well
6212444 it depends on the motivation the players have when they come here however milan never has had a problem managing their players
6212445 at any rate in general it is not certain that shevchenko will come and it is not certain that the market will be closed if shevchenko arrives
6212446 nuestro inter s no es que se cierren las escuelas sino que cumplan

6212449 since latifa was born we have always been allowed to put a dash in the religious field of her birth certificate and other official documents
6212450 this changed when she went to sit her secondary school exams and we were told that we had to list her religion as either muslim or christian
6212451 i petitioned the minister of education and latifa sat the exams and passed
6212452 however i have now discovered that they have listed her as muslim in her coordination office papers
6212453 i have contacted the national council for human rights and the ministries concerned and i am waiting for them to take action

6212455 it was disheartening like being hit with a heavy blow i couldnt believe it because i took a lot of pride in my job
6212456 weve had many investigations about discrimination in the dallas police department right so if the crime scene unit is a part of the dallas police department ergo its not a big leap of the imagination im not angry with anybody but i know whats going on
6212457 its not like somebody overtly runs out and says im gonna take roosevelt out because hes black
6212458 i got the sense that somebody didnt like roosevelt and they obviously wanted to get rid of roosevelt
6212459 i was more hurt than anything but i didnt think it was racial
6212460 i dont know if im na ve or what but i was hurt at the fact that they took me off because i wasnt qualified and they put two individuals on with less experience
6212461 look mr building guy these boxes are filled to the brim with dirt am i right the ground as we call it is basically dirt right so dirt is also ground right try to concentrate
6212462 ok the roof of my building is only three stories up from the ground in these boxes so im within the law right
6212463 oh good point i never thought of just piling up dirt in boxes and then claiming the tops of the boxes are the ground yes indeed you have outfoxed the law you wily devil you may proceed unencumbered by my attentions
6212464 i was like how in the hell can that pass im like everybody else

6212466 it amazes me that nearly 175 years after the alamo the gabacho intruders of texas still get weirded out whenever its conquered minority dares assert some type of cultural pride
6212467 listen o pasty sons and daughters of the lone star republic mexicans merely want a bit of acknowledgment for the vital role they play in your state and if you dont believe me talk to the ghost of juan segu n
6212468 with the recent events youve been involved in do you still consider yourself a good role model for kids
6212469 that dont make sense for you to thats the last thing you should ask me thats not what its about out here its about giving back to the community thats the only thing its about nobody dont have time for that man like for real
6212470 hes out here today isnt he all of this is for his charity not everybody can go through what hes gone through and still show his face
6212471 im just trying to stay positive and put all that stuff behind me
6212472 im gonna keep on doing my charity stuff i didnt have this sort of thing when i was growing up thats why i like to put on these events for the kids ya know
6212473 the anger is still in me i just have more of a control on it
6212474 i always think its fun with that kind of stuff because thats what the minor leagues are about
6212475 its like that old bull durham promotion hit the bull win a steak
6212476 there were no hard feelings it could have been a matter of time place or difference of opinion

6212499 woke up with a semi hard dick in a fat chick three this week call that a hat trick but everybody know hockey aint for black kids
6212500 throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just dont care
6212501 i was still young in my career and im going out there and im having a big ego and i want it all to be about me
6212502 i want the world of rock to check out what im doing but im also on a tour with pearl jam and the red hot chili peppers and ministry and ice cube
6212503 and its like guess what its not going to be all about me in fact im way down on the list and im going to have to like suck it up and learn about what i do and learn about the craft and learn about just enjoying playing music
6212504 when you look at just the different bands and compare it to other festival tours its kind of the least genre oriented
6212505 lollapalooza originally came out that way it wasnt genre oriented at all the whole idea of the tour was to mix it up as much as possible
6212506 i did i think six or seven shows with linkin park in australia when they did their australian tour this last year and it just was great
6212507 it wasnt my audience and i had to go out basically and do what i do and earn the respect of these people every night and it was really a great refreshing feeling it wasnt preaching to the choir
6212508 i noticed in the last year playing festivals worked really well for me because i can mix it up and do some of the heavier rock that ive ever written as well as turn around and do songs where im just singing and playing acoustic guitar
6212509 for a guy to be able to mix it up as much as i do this type of tour is ideal
6212510 he wanted me to ask you guys if there is anything happening tonight
6212511 i think its a better record but the next one is going to be intentionally much more of a departure
6212512 that was it then we promptly moved to california were not even considered an l a band its very humorous
6212513 i still havent changed my mind about that i really love it here
6212514 they always told us if we would hang out with the radio people here more wed get more attention
6212515 thats just jive you mean i have to hang out at some coke party with a bunch of dumbasses in order to get them interested in our band wrong guy drop us now please
6212516 big holes of silence between orchestrated movements they make your nose bleed but in a really good way
6212517 im over they heads like a bulimic on a see saw
6212518 put my heart in a vise and proceeded to twist that vise until the last frame
6212519 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6212520 and you see how the great plan yes is working you see you see our people those uh not trapped by the mortgage crisis yes are very fine looking people indeed now we go see the pandas very nice pandas
6212521 boom dee a da boom dee a da boom dee a da is it try this if you know what cable channel the show is on go to that website they might have the song title there
6212522 the acute phase of the crisis provoked by the georgian forces assault on tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia is now behind us
6212523 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6212524 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6212525 i love the smell of unit testing in the morning you know one time we had a function recursed for 12 hours when it was all over i walked up we didnt find one of em not one stinkin assertion failure the smell you know that stale pizza smell the whole workstation smelled like victory someday this code cycles gonna end
6212526 the harry potter thing is useful because there will be a lot of people whove never been to the theater before and if we can bring them to the theater thats amazing
6212527 they were show horses and they were such beautiful creatures
6212528 so powerful i personally think blinding so many horses is impossible because if you blind one itll kick you in the head and youre out
6212529 there are more people in therapy in this country than england so you get it
6212530 he has the most brilliant encyclopedic knowledge that anyone could ever possess and he never imposes it on you
6212531 so instead of his dad being a communist and such we leave it at they had a great marriage
6212532 the play asks a question why and its a question for which no one has the answer
6212533 his default setting is that hes got this malcolm mcdowell rage so when you show his human side hes more interesting
6212534 if you saw us in rehearsal you might think it was a comedy
6212535 offended mothers were calling up and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to go see it
6212536 ok dont see it theyre treating it like its pornography and its not its only seven minutes at the end of the play when im naked and im 19 now
6212537 youre in there and there are these hooves flying around and im naked by that point its terrifying that scene is one of the most shocking pieces of theater and i deserve very little credit for that those horses are amazing
6212538 i asked him how do you memorize all those lines
6212539 and he told me to just learn them in rehearsal so i did about a month before by the time opening night came i knew everyone elses lines too
6212540 and it would be really hard to do this without him were both onstage the entire length of the play were there for each others scenes as spectators so we developed a kind of kinship
6212541 were never in situations in films where we have to save each other
6212542 or to stop each other from making public embarrassments of ourselves you know when an actor pauses whether its for dramatic effect or its a forgotten line you can see the panic behind the eyes
6212543 it only happened once but my horseman will kemp had me on his shoulders and he was supposed to run and jump off a block
6212544 but he missed his footing and instead of hitting here he hit there and the blocks slid across the stage the whole audience went whoa and i was just laughing out of pure terror but he managed to keep me on his shoulders
6212545 its the same reason to go see live music for those little moments
6212546 and if im going to screw up i couldnt screw up in front of better people
6212547 holy f ck and dmst bring it every time and of course acts like the drift need to be on more playlists
6212548 im also really looking forward to megasoid and the local band our music director has done a great job
6212549 ich verneige mich mit respekt und ergriffenheit vor dem mut dieser m nner die ihre aufgabe bis zum h chsten opfer erf llt haben
6212550 weil wir gegen ber den taliban nicht nachgeben d rfen
6212551 i guess the government will need to take another step
6212552 the problem is that the bigger the commitment you make the more people sometimes want to test that commitment its going to be an interesting time to see what the government does do

6212559 i wonder when we started using research as an intransitive verb
6212560 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6212561 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6212562 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6212563 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6212564 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6212565 our neighbors should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6212566 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6212567 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6212568 theres a part of all of us that wants to be boardwalk
6212569 but if you want to win monopoly you buy the affordable places and you build hotels thats what going to happen with toronto
6212570 congratulations to montreal but when we play were still going to win

6212572 i love the new board i love the fact canadas on there three times
6212573 right now were going to go through the details of the decision before making further comment
6212574 programming dedicated primarily to the coverage and celebration of canadian athletes with a particular emphasis on amateur athletes
6212575 its a bit of a compromise and i think its not unreasonable
6212576 i think its a win win cbcs going be able to do what they said they want to do which is celebrate amateur sports and canadian athletes and athletics and not basically just be a second network for cbc to run live sporting events all day long
6212577 expects the cbc to abide by its commitment to broadcast 80 per cent canadian content in each broadcast year

6212585 weve had reports of people having 3 to 5 feet of water in their home
6212586 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6212587 i didnt think it was going to be that deep
6212588 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for other two guys that were still stuck in there
6212589 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial there are other areas of the state getting 10 12 inches that have crops in the ground and are getting too much
6212590 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6212591 about the set lists its a process of trial and error mostly error we actually had some time to rehearse a couple of songs weve never played live before and were gonna do these now on this tour most of the songs will however be a nice mixture of old and new favorites some to which you can dance and some to which you cant we tried hard to bring this tour to hawaii but not hard enough i think i sent a request to have all off days in either hawaii or las vegas but neither seems to be possible this time so wed probably end up staying on the bus in front of a wal mart somewhere speaking of wal mart our shopping lists include socks chivas regal 12 years old frank zappa cds cowboy boots marlboro lights ice more chivas and new zippo lighters i sincerely believe our finnish super livers will survive many more tours than this one so no liver transplants will be necessary conan obrien should still fear having us show up in his studio audience because we will prevail eventually were bound to succeed according to the great prophecies of reverend lance what would be greater than appearing on his first show when he replaces jay leno well keep the rest of the plan a secret
6212592 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6212593 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6212594 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6212605 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6212606 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6212607 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of coordination to patch
6212608 help from in the form of usable bug reports and responsible time lines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible our vulnerability bulletins will credit responsible reporters of any flaws
6212609 a beta test by any other name is still a beta test
6212610 its a wise practice for google emphasizing that android is going to be solid and stable is important to google particularly because we are seeing a version one release and we know that version one releases come with their own set of challenges
6212611 obviously how apple tests its products and the forum in which it tests its products is somewhat different than what google is doing here

6212722 no matter who the victim is it does not change the process
6212723 leo abse will be remembered by the gay community with a mixture of appreciation and disappointment
6212724 although gay people felt huge relief following the passage of his 1967 gay law reform we were also angry because his bill perpetuated the criminalisation of many aspects of gay life it was not the liberation that many of us had wanted and expected
6212725 his homosexual law reform bill decriminalised sex between men but only in narrow circumstances it retained many discriminatory
6212726 the homosexual law reform society was often exasperated by leos expectation that it should lobby mps to win support for his bill while he ignored their concerns that his limited reform proposals maintained homophobic discrimination
6212727 mr abse could be quite arrogant and patronising towards gay people he had a sometimes dismissive disapproving attitude towards the gay human rights movement believing that law reform should be left to politicians like him and that gay organisations should play at best a marginal backroom role

6213173 the finest british production of chekhov in recent memory with a pitch perfect cast elegant staging and the clarity and cunning of christopher hamptons adaptation
6213174 a bold supremely truthful production chekhovs plays live on a knife edge routinely described as tragic comic most productions however topple over into either doomy tragedy or overly fierce comedy the exhilaration of ricksons balancing act is evident from the very opening
6213175 an mps primary duty is to his constituents raila odinga owes his share of power to the youth of kibera who not only voted for him but also rose up in arms to protest electoral rigging
6213176 we understand his limitations as he is only sharing political power with president kibaki but all we are asking for is the basic human dignity and survival
6213177 humanitarian assistance by international and local ngos is needed but it is not a substitute for the governments role a durable solution warrants political will and governmental action
6213178 there are no gangs or gang warfare as such in kibera it should be obvious to all that most people here work or are looking for work 65 per cent of nairobis industrial labour and workers force comes from kibera
6213179 and though the government does not recognise it as a formal settlement the officials of nairobi city council and other departments are always busy collecting taxes and other levies from the shopkeepers and traders of kibera
6213180 you can see its a vibrant place people live here you can see the potential of its people in the way they deal with their daily survival needs
6213181 for long weve had only two kinds of community leaders in kibera pastors and community politicians both have misled us now new leadership is emerging from within the youth that does not want to see the world through tribal and sectarian lenses
6213182 a solid platform is available to introduce new policies there is a strong force of young and organised men and women our mp can rely on
6213183 you cannot tar the entire sector with the same brush we have sought no funding and rely entirely on contributions from our members and individual supporters membership is not restricted to one ethnic or religious group it is our common suffering there is a need to face and address the trauma our communities especially women have suffered this year
6213184 as the government provides virtually no public service where would we be without the medical care hiv control programmes education and other essential projects run by the ngos the very fact that there is space for women like us to organise ourselves and to be able to work for promotion of peace is possible because of the years of effort put in by development workers from abroad and locally
6213185 everyone acknowledges that kibera needs social housing water sanitation and basic health services hundreds of ngos and charities have been working on these issues for decades why no sustainable results could be achieved is because the issue is essentially political if anyone can take on these powerful politically connected vested interests it has to be the political leadership of the country

6213200 when we use drugs you have to use it at the right dose too low a dose doesnt give you the effect you want too high a dose has the chance of producing too much of an effect or just basic toxicity
6213201 its a window you try and stay within in the first case we were worried about getting too much in now were worried about not getting enough in
6213202 if youre talking about substances that you have to have because of critical medical conditions like cancer or if you have had a kidney or some kind of transplant or if youve had a previous heart attack you have to get enough into the bloodstream to produce an effect
6213203 so if you want to get the most chance of having the most consistent uniform effect what you should really do is take your medication with a whole glass of water on an empty stomach
6213204 we had expected that the drug levels were going to go up in actual fact they went down that was a bit of a surprise to us
6213205 common orange juice which is probably drunk a lot more than grapefruit juice
6213206 but im sure well find many other drugs for which this happens
6213207 because a lot of my patients and i imagine other peoples patients describe how they take their morning pills with a glass of orange juice thats how they remember to take it every day
6213208 so theyd be having their juice in the morning with it
6213209 people shouldnt panic and change their consumption of fruit juices based on this information
6213210 its not even fully clear yet which drugs it does it to and to what an extent it does it
6213211 was a real big deal because you can kill somebody with too much felodipine
6213212 there arent too many drugs where that is a real real danger

6213248 you came to america for a month and only decided to bring 400
6213249 yeah its not like im going to spend it on useless stuff just food and essentials really
6213250 im not going to hug you cos that would be weird
6213251 there are so many people who want a baby why drop it in the street
6213252 all she was trying to do was make things better for her and her kids
6213253 jashya was returned with the consent and advice of both acs and the childs law guardian
6213254 its like he was trying to put a window down or open a door but was unable to
6213255 how could somebody do that how could you forget your son inside a truck
6213256 we have to get him ready to go to jesus
6213257 there are no excuses for this to happen to any baby
6213258 this is murder he had no reason to die he died because he cried
6213259 i mean not only did crystal and craig lose a son but crystal lost a husband and craigs parents lost a son and a grandson one day this was a happy perfect family and the next day its been devastated
6213260 maybe they both could have used a meeting that night
6213261 like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut
6213262 they pulled together they prayed together they took baby camryn off life support together
6213263 and that was a wonderful thing that they were able to pull together like that despite craig being alleged to have done these things
6213264 i dont care what craigs family members think he did this to my son may he get what he deserves maybe people should talk more about camryn than craig craigs name has no worth to even be mentioned
6213265 the question becomes if that autopsy is accurate if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions multiple occasions how come no one knew that
6213266 he only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured what other folks in the household could have injured him then craig quickly took responsibility
6213267 no matter what happens craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison
6213268 if thats the breadwinner or the main breadwinner then youve got some serious financial problems right off the bat
6213269 i lost my job because of this because i couldnt work enough hours now i have to move into a smaller place
6213270 it will be the basis for divorces itll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides and we end up with a lot of conflict
6213271 i cant have hate eat me up and beat me down i cant live like that
6213272 i will have to one day forgive him so that i might find peace
6213273 intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
6213274 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
6213275 she couldnt tell me that i wanted to give her a balloon but she didnt want that she only wants her mommy she said and she said that these people took her from her mommy
6213276 we have a very sick young lady both mentally and physically
6213277 we dont even know if she understood who we are she didnt even know what she did
6213278 you would least expect this from her we just want to know why
6213279 quite honestly living that far out of state i would have issues with
6213280 i told her the baby was safe in gods hands
6213281 lets just say it was apparent the wounds came from the dog and we dont know what caused the death of the child but at this point it appears to be dog bites
6213282 the parents were home there were several people home three people at the time of the incident obviously thats part of the investigation to determine how this tragic event unfolded
6213283 all the investigators and firefighters the paramedics many of us have children of our own so when you see something like this occur that was a defenseless child it really strikes deep
6213284 you never think of it happening in your yard or neighborhood
6213285 we have dogs of our own always have we raised three boys of our own and we have our grandchildren and i cant imagine this happening to one of our children
6213286 represent one of the most deplorable acts committed by a public servant
6213287 one of our most important obligations as a society is to protect those who are most vulnerable particularly our youth
6213288 to prey on those who are essentially defenseless is contemptible
6213289 and if he has violated that oath not only must he resign from office but he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
6213290 its a very specialized kind of thing and it has to be dealt with carefully so that you dont block a site that youve got to do legitimate research on
6213291 were really surprised that it happened its a shame if its true
6213292 sometimes those who develop programs or create legislation have greater knowledge concerning the issue at hand
6213293 as a result the person gets a bit sloppy assuming that he or she will not get caught after all who better to know their way around the system than the person who is a part of the system
6213294 i want to move on with my life im trying to graduate high school and forget about this
6213295 i try not to think about it but its hard because all i can think about is what if hes out there around other kids
6213296 the idea of that monster being that close to my family again is outrageous
6213297 the simple truth is that i had to rule based on what was presented to me during that hearing and i took everything into consideration and felt a bond was appropriate
6213298 for a judge to delay jail is highly unusual but its especially unusual when you have someone convicted of a serious crime like sexual molestation of a child
6213299 one of the concerns is that you have someone who commits a sex offense who by their employment seeks to be around children they have abused that trust between a student and teacher
6213300 this was one of the most disturbing cases ive ever worked on and theres no doubt in my mind that aaron mohanlal is a dangerous person
6213301 i called the state attorneys office to see if it was some kind of mistake i dont see what would stop him from doing this to other kids
6213302 we are confident that he is doing what hes supposed to be doing
6213303 this guy has all the reason in the world to take off
6213304 hes looking at prison for the rest of his life
6213305 and child molesters are almost always victimized in prison he has to know that
6213306 this is not effective monitoring in fact its a little bit beyond imagination whats going on here

6213322 it was not our initiative to put the group together or be part of the tour
6213323 we gave them a general overview of what was going on in the oil and gas industry very general kind of what we give to many other people when they are visiting
6213324 were thrilled to be able to give back to families that have given so much to our country
6213325 we hope this project will demonstrate how easy it is to save energy at home we can lower our energy bills reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create jobs in the green building sector at the same time
6213326 we are excited about this opportunity to increase the green building we incorporate into the homes we build for the severely injured veterans we assist
6213327 this grant will allow us to incorporate state of the art building techniques and materials such as geothermal heating system and photovoltaic solar panels to give our veterans the long term economic and environmental benefits of green building it will also allow us to educate the public about our experiences with green building so we can be part of expanding this nationwide effort
6213328 most people wont notice those and other modifications but it means a lot to travis
6213329 this news has come as a great shock to everyone including it seems his own wife and family
6213330 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family
6213331 liz has had a great influence on me and having a family has really helped my cricket
6213332 i envision those on the short list will be made public
6213333 we need to protect people so they can stay in the process comfortably
6213334 its important to the city its important to this community
6213335 and were going to make sure the freedom festival continues here in the city of evansville in some shape or form

6213338 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care

6213341 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was
6213342 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly
6213343 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6213344 it makes no sense to regularly target command and control nodes with precision guided munitions while denying highly capable sniper teams the ability to attack individual targets
6213345 the messy business of back alley tradecraft has taken a back seat to the much simpler business of liaison with foreign intelligence services
6213346 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
6213347 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a shadow government for baghdad
6213348 but it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details it will eventually press for a competitive petroleum production sharing regime which could make opec irrelevant to iraqs oil output or supply decisions
6213349 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
6213350 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
6213351 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major u s action outside north america
6213352 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus only natos military decisions require consensus
6213353 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup detat in brussels
6213354 he looks forward every year to buying a new car
6213355 here but you cannot say a word to any one
6213356 well he does now i told him he was rude to you earlier and explained we are friends and he was shocked and said you and her are
6213357 but see him coming back here and apologizing that was so sweet and i hope you really really like each other because hes my date to the baseball game next friday
6213358 if a good rain doesnt come soon corn yield will go down and some of bean pods will fail to produce any beans so the situation bears watching
6213359 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6213360 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest

6213364 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6213365 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6213366 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6213367 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6213368 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6213369 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions

6213376 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6213377 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6213378 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6213397 were getting to the point where i feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to
6213398 we had a great car at michigan but obviously did not get the result we were looking for
6213399 we dropped positions in the standings and now we have to enter the next few races with a different mindset before we were in a position where taking risks wasnt an option we had a pretty comfortable margin on the transfer spot and we didnt want to jeopardize that were not in that position anymore so now we must go all out and see where we end up
6213400 it seems like bristol is a track where we really really run good
6213401 weve led on the last lap the past couple of times there and not won the race its good to go back there because we know we can run really well its just a nerve wracking racetrack because you never know what can happen
6213402 weve given up some points over the last few weeks so we need get back to business and work on padding our points lead
6213403 bristol is a place that all the teams have marked on their calendars
6213404 we have been lucky enough to win one there which is pretty cool crew chief trip bruce made a call to pit early last year which helped us win the race we had a great truck and i knew i would have to be patient in order to get back to the front it was a great night
6213405 i got my start racing off road trucks so its going to be cool to be back in a truck
6213406 ive never driven one before ive always wondered how they drive and what theyre about ive spent so much time with hornaday and hes been such a big part of my career to be able to go out and race against him is going to be blast
6213407 obviously with a 78 point lead now i think its pretty healthy
6213408 so definitely with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that helio is very good at as well and so we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points but it would be nice to gain a couple on helio in sonoma and maybe we only need 82 points or something to have it sewn up by the end that would be nice
6213409 it was an incredible honor to be invited to present an award at this years ceremony i think the alma awards are a very important evening for the latin community in the united states and i am certainly proud to have been affiliated with it
6213410 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff its too early to say yet whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
6213411 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time
6213412 its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers as a new circuit i think it gives the drivers a chance to show what they can do but i am not under any illusions as i expect all the drivers to be quick

6213524 jmps legal defense against the homeowners claims insofar as those claims concerned the windows supplied by weather shield regardless of whether weather shield was ultimately found negligent
6213525 the appellate majority however agreed with the trial court that weather shields duty to defend arose immediately upon the filing of claims based on its work and
6213526 specifies that a basic contractual indemnity against particular claims demands or liabilities embraces the costs of defense against such claims demands or liabilities duty to indemnify and separately specifies the indemnitors duty actually to defend duty to defend
6213527 here the subcontract at issue not only failed to limit or exclude weather shields duty to defend jmp as otherwise provided by subdivision 4 of section 2778 it confirmed this duty in language similar to that of the statute the subcontract explicitly obligated weather shield both to indemnify jmp against certain claims which would have only been triggered if weather shield was ultimately found at fault and at its own expense to defend jmp against any suit or action founded upon such claims which arose before and regardless of any finding of fault in the litigation

6213591 the world trade center attacks mark a deep cut in our recent history that is still being processed the french american artist douglas edric stanley has found an unusual though obvious metaphor with his work

6213595 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
6213596 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today
6213597 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
6213598 this is pro basketball good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
6213599 she has done a wonderful job and she knows what our new mission is
6213600 just like everybody else shes going to be held to a higher standard
6213601 every three or four years were told we have the right players then the bottom falls out
6213602 i think its good that sheila is stepping up and letting us know she cares
6213603 some of us have wondered is this just a novelty item to her does she really care about womens basketball and this team at least she cares

6213607 weve chosen to partner with microsoft to compete effectively with rim
6213608 even with the growth in this market 90 percent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 percent

6213613 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour

6213617 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
6213618 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
6213619 our estimate assumes each of the 2 200 at amp t stores will sell an average of 5 phones per day from the july 11th launch through the end of the september quarter
6213620 we believe that our revision may be conservative and that apple will meet our estimates
6213621 the august 22nd launch in additional countries should provide another catalyst to sales

6213669 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company

6213724 the last 24 years youve had an opportunity to do some great things for this state and this country and in my opinion youve failed
6213725 i think you have worked with a president for the last eight years closer than anyone i think hes failed in my judgment hes the worst president in my lifetime
6213726 my opponent is a good guy ive known him for years but the reality is hes only a few years younger than i am
6213727 and his chances of being in a position im in not only for kentucky agriculture but kentucky in general is slim to say the least
6213728 i think we are going to have some debates i enjoy them
6213729 hes not going to be for any of these trade agreements that will allow you to sell your products abroad becaues the afl cio wont let him
6213730 i always got the feeling with sen mcconnells background that he had a briefcase in the back of his car

6213741 youre for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with some exceptions for life and rape and incest
6213742 article in which staff writers shailagh murray and perry bacon jr
6213743 in his interview with warren mccain received loud applause from the crowd of more than 2 000 when he declared his view that unborn children deserve rights at the moment of conception and offered one of the most emphatic declarations of his opposition to abortion in his presidential campaign
6213744 presidential contenders barack obama and john mccain differed sharply on abortion saturday with mccain saying a babys human rights begin at conception while obama restated his support for legalized abortion
6213745 the contrast between the two men may have been sharpest on abortion
6213746 over the weekend mccain emerged from a forum at the saddleback evangelical church with high praise from conservatives for his answer to the question about when life begins
6213747 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6213748 if the status quo of aboriginal economic and educational initiatives continues street gangs and violent activity will increase and already marginalized aboriginal populations will experience a diminishing quality of life
6213749 the fallout from aboriginal poverty is all too obvious and will only get worse
6213750 their spread from urban centres to reserves is not a sign of organizational growth but rather the continuing unhealthy social state of these communities
6213751 the rcmp has engaged in past initiatives directed at aboriginal people and we should play yet still a greater role if we want to make a difference in their communities as well as strengthen our understaffed ranks
6213752 such an initiative would be akin to the marshall plan that rebuilt europe in the 1950s
6213753 at the same time if these aboriginal candidates decided not to join the rcmp but go on to other careers this would still benefit their communities
6213754 its a partnership that has to develop with the communities
6213755 this is the first time we have ever in 40 years working around the world been the victims of a terrorist attack so this is new territory for us

6213759 its just a feeling of canadians the way we are and the way we have operated for years we dont feel that weve been targeted
6213760 its an extremely unfortunate incident but it was unforeseen and unpreventable unless you say we just wont do the job if you do the job youre exposed and at certain times like this time there was no way of getting the proper intel they just hit and hit big and that was it

6213770 the obvious risk that we always think about is pregnancy but thats only one small risk of unprotected intercourse they bear the burden of the risk if they have a sexually transmitted disease
6213771 in a man its treatable in a woman although we say its treatable it can leave consequences such as infertility
6213772 we do know from other studies that individuals who are in shorter term relationships are more likely to use a condom than individuals in longer term relationships
6213773 its possible that youth between the ages of 18 and 19 are in longer term relationships and therefore they perceive their risk for sexually transmitted disease infection to be lower and so unfortunately theyre not using a condom
6213774 theres not much spent on publicity if you compare lets say the amount that is spent for the prevention of smoking versus prevention of stds its totally disproportionate
6213775 millions and millions are invested to prevent smoking which it should be but these millions are not there to prevent stds

6214013 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6214014 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

6214024 we had invoices for anything and everything we took out of there we took only what belonged to us
6214025 we have evidence and eye witnesses that they sold our equipment as a down payment on a few pieces of equipment that they purchased
6214026 they traded in several large items which were owned by us
6214027 i believe thats theft the night they left they also took our 52 inch tv that was hanging on the wall
6214028 we had closed at 8 and 9 oclock on other occasions there was no duplicity in that
6214029 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6214030 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6214031 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6214032 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6214033 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6214034 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads

6214051 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
6214052 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
6214053 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
6214054 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
6214055 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
6214056 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
6214057 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
6214058 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
6214059 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
6214060 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
6214061 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
6214062 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
6214063 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
6214064 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
6214065 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
6214066 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
6214067 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
6214068 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
6214069 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
6214070 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
6214071 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir

6214083 what can they give me can they give me my son back i want other people not to have their children die or be damaged
6214084 theres no reason for this drug to be on the market for nursing mothers any more

6214090 an oil crisis is coming in the next 10 years its not a matter of demand its not a matter of supplies its both
6214091 the problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant
6214092 weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens
6214093 the sentimental belief that the things we fear will never really happen
6214094 i suggest that this is a good time to think soberly about our responsibilities to our descendants those who will ring out the fossil fuel age

6214098 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6214099 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6214100 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6214101 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6214102 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6214103 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6214104 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6214105 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6214106 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6214107 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6214108 it is too early to discuss specific features capabilities or timing
6214109 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6214110 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6214111 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
6214112 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
6214113 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
6214114 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
6214115 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
6214116 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6214117 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest
6214118 theres a surprising dearth of law on high seas salvage
6214119 the wave of foreclosures is unprecedented making it difficult to analyze difficult to gauge how large it will get or how bad it will make things
6214120 since foreclosed properties are reduced in price until they sell an increase in foreclosure transactions simply means there are more foreclosures rather than more buyers
6214121 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which could help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming to the market
6214122 women spend 136 days of their lives getting ready for a night out enough time for an astronaut to fly to the moon and back 22 times
6214123 lo dif cil no es estar con los amigos cuando tienen raz n sino cuando se equivocan
6214124 they might when they get the money and hes gotten more but hes the one who has given up the most
6214125 my husbands siblings said i should take money for driving him around and everything else i did but i didnt want to do that
6214126 i wasnt comfortable taking that extra money but i dont disapprove of it
6214127 whether its a friendly or hostile situation families do squabble over it
6214128 a lot of times the siblings that arent taking care of the parent contribute money and thats their contribution to the care
6214129 its one of the most stressful things you can do
6214130 theres a recent study that showed even three years after the person being cared for has passed away the caregiver still has higher levels of stress than normal
6214131 were all so thankful she was willing to take care of him
6214132 i see this once in a while in wills but even in the best families there are times where one person gets jealous or doesnt like that someone else got more
6214133 survivors can do it after the death but its like signing a contract among themselves and it would be a rather complex document
6214134 but theres nowhere for it to come from in our case
6214135 we havent discussed the financial arrangement in any level of detail
6214136 but if i start feeling hard pressed i remind myself i dont pay any expenses for this house
6214137 i think theres such sufficient understanding at the most senior levels of this campaign of the importance of the pro family constituency that im very comfortable with how the selection process is proceeding
6214138 nobody has called me regarding the vice presidency from the mccain campaign
6214139 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
6214140 effectively destroyed the republican party and pushed the conservative movement into the bleachers
6214141 i would think they would want to talk to us but i havent heard from any of them yet
6214142 theres no coordinated effort its everybody doing their own thing
6214143 to the extent that we know about these families and they are eligible we will help them
6214144 theres a universe of public programs out there youre doing a good job when you make sure people are accessing these programs it ultimately comes down to a human dealing with another human
6214145 personally im fearing the worst i think he is dead
6214146 the police are saying that hes just a man who doesnt want to be found
6214147 but hes not that type of man he has no money he has plenty of reasons to come home but he hasnt even checked on his mother or called any members of his family
6214148 even if he had just up and left at least he would have made the payment on his jeep but he didnt
6214149 if he really doesnt want to be found i can deal with that but i dont see it hes my husband i love him and i want to make sure hes ok
6214150 we dont know what the needs are going to be
6214151 a lot of these individuals will probably feel a greater impact at christmastime than they do today the mental health issues are continuing to grow
6214152 the emotional toll is in many ways the area we have the most difficulty with
6214153 a set of diagnostic behavioral health responders who can go from one area to another across iowa the preparedness is unclear especially in rural areas we find the resources are lacking
6214154 folks who are trying to figure out what theyre supposed to do when in the one book they have five different directions they are supposed to go
6214155 dss is required by state policy to continue with the eligibility determination of all other household members
6214156 how are employees of dss able to ensure the integrity of the registration when they are prohibited from addressing questions of immigration status
6214157 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6214158 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6214159 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6214160 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6214161 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6214162 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6214163 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6214164 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
6214165 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
6214166 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
6214167 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
6214168 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
6214169 its a great way to continue a benefit for people whove worked hard for our community
6214170 the last thing we want is to be forced like gm to cut off our retirees
6214171 i would enroll my own parents in this its that good
6214172 its comparable or enhanced coverage depending on what plan retirees had before
6214173 what stopped it until now i think is mostly the fear that people would get less coverage than they currently have and thats really not the case
6214174 were trying to find out whats best for us and best for them
6214175 we dont have any intention of leaving them out of the loop
6214176 aggressive proposal on pensions general wage increases in every year and to improve career progression systems
6214177 to be positive about it there is dialogue going on
6214178 that we havent had in the previous negotiators for the company the company just needs to come to the table with serious proposals
6214179 we should have had a lot more progress than what we did considering we started main table negotiations a month early
6214180 there are some problems some design features with the site that make it difficult for people to use and they cant get the maximum value out of it
6214181 weve worked hard to organize and format our quality compare tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
6214182 more research is probably needed to assess the usability of the site and should be performed by people who have a basic understanding of the size and complexity of the program
6214183 while i appreciate the fpdr staff is as diligent as they are what were focused on is that retirees have a predictable and stable amount of money every month
6214184 i know this is concerning and disturbing to the people who are affected were committed to protecting them and if we need to stand up for them we will its just upsetting for everybody
6214185 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6214186 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6214187 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6214188 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6214189 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6214190 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6214191 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6214192 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6214193 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6214194 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6214195 se consuma cu bere tsingtao cate o lada la fiecare portie
6214196 as you all know families are the foundation of the long term care system in the united states policy wise we dont do a lot to support that group
6214197 i talk to so many family caregivers and they dont know what they need theyre overwhelmed theyre exhausted
6214198 with jakie chan jet li that is like impossible to find if youre not willing to pay for it
6214199 in looking at the broad culinary food beverage health nutrition world we saw that it did fit the model

6214201 originally published in 1942 the offbeat tale centers on a man who becomes increasingly disturbed when he realizes he cannot account for his activities during the day or even what he does for a living he divulges his problem to the husband and wife partners of a private detective agency and their investigation leads to a series of revelations they could never have fathomed

6214203 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6214204 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6214205 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6214212 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
6214213 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
6214214 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
6214215 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive

6214227 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
6214228 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
6214229 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
6214230 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
6214231 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act

6214236 i am not as good as half those guys out there

6214240 earlier this week we showed you how to auto change desktop backgrounds in ubuntu using a small script and a scheduling tool
6214241 its worth noting that ubuntu linux is actually friendlier with windows based business networks than xp home which is limited to peer to peer networking
6214242 it comes in four colors onyx snow solar and blossom sylvania g netbooks and accessories are available at leading retailers inside dells blacktop laptop linux os
6214243 dell may be one of microsofts largest customers but the hardware heavyweight has decided that windows simply isnt good dells comeback machine
6214244 i mention that the pink looks a lot better in person than online a dell executive is quick to tell me why what ive seen on the what to expect in debian 5 lenny
6214245 unlike the last debian release etch which was delayed for several months by internal developer dissension lenny however
6214246 if you routinely back up a large amount of data onto dvds you can simply number your discs and keep them in numerically sorted order
6214247 not all that long ago you could not give the linux desktop away no matter how hard you tried

6214257 we are what we think your imagination can do more harm than your worst enemy
6214258 but once you control your thoughts no one can help you so much not even your father or your mother
6214259 there was a sheik in damascus called abu musa al qumasi
6214260 she said leave me first save my husband who was sitting more or less over there the neighbors removed the debris from the place she had pointed to and found the sheik who said leave me first save my wife who was lying down more or less over there
6214261 when someone acts like this couple they are purifying the whole world through their faith in life and love
6214262 one year ago i gave a speech in an aircraft carrier saying that we had succeeded in reaching an important objective accomplishing a mission which was to remove saddam hussein from power as a result there are no more torture chambers no more mass graves
6214263 we feel that our mouth is sealed or that the words just dont come out however the mere fact of making an effort to overcome this situation is in itself a beneficial attitude
6214264 youre right at such times what you should do is look up at the sky and say lord almighty i am so far from you that i cant even believe my own voice because the truth is that the lord always hears and answers it is we who do not manage to talk for fear that he will pay no attention to us

6214267 of course if you do it once and youre successful its not expensive but if you need more cycles its very costly
6214268 for example fertilisation of the egg is now done by microinjection using fine glass needles so you can catch a single sperm and inject it directly into the egg
6214269 patients who want private care will still go private so it remains to be seen if the subsidies will see patients clogging up the public hospitals

6214273 collaborates with other organisations to hold combined activities and further opportunities to network with others outside the firm
6214274 more receptive to the idea of giving dating services a shot
6214275 many singles like to take part in charity activities because they feel that they are not only widening their social circles but also helping others
6214276 some of these programmes are not commonly explored at the moment and would appeal to the singles without them feeling that they are being pressurised to attend singles only events
6214277 it should be a more relaxed and casual environment so that participants feel comfortable enough to get to know each other better
6214278 its a big turn off when the atmosphere is very forced not everyone is hard up to find a partner there and then
6214279 some participants both guys and girls are too desperate when they go for singles events they dont even know the other party that well but theyre already trying to set up dates
6214280 ive stayed out of this the whole time now its time i told the truth
6214281 no one cares what the hell you stick up your twat

6214284 my father said that when the breadwinner dies the children are thrown on gods mercy so we try to be an instrument there and help out as best we can these youngsters who are left behind because they are our most precious asset
6214285 if it was a small amount it didnt matter the idea of someone wanting to do that thats what was so important so right now im still speechless its a relief just to know that its there that it will be there for them
6214286 reneau the only person inside the store and who carried a weapon alone made the decision to take keerans life mr wood was outside the store in his brothers truck
6214287 the state argued that he was responsible for keerans murder and portrayed wood as little more than a sap steamrolled by the villainous reneau
6214288 asked on death row last week to identify the shooter reneau had a one word reply me
6214289 prosecutors reversed their strategy arguing that wood deserved to die because hed gotten reneau to do his dirty work
6214290 bowing to mr woods emotional and irrational insistence mr woods appointed lawyers declined to cross examine any witnesses or present any evidence on mr woods behalf
6214291 not only did woods defense withhold from the jury evidence of his troubled youth but they also failed to cross examine any state witnesses including the wildly speculative testimony of dr james grigson derisively known by many including colleagues in the psychiatric community as dr death for predictably offering testimony in capital cases that a defendant would pose a danger to society one of the questions a jury must decide in order to impose a death sentence
6214292 this can mean sentencing someone to death even if he or she had no proven role in a murder
6214293 if in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony another felony is committed by one of the conspirators all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed though having no intent to commit it

6214315 there will be demand for qualified good people in this childcare industry and quite frankly i think wages salaries for people in this sector would have to rise in order to attract quality people in sufficient quantities
6214316 thats why we thought this is a timely occasion to raise the subsidy levels so that we can increase the number we can increase quality and also affordability but we also need to understand that at the end of the day there are trade offs that need to be made

6214321 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
6214322 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regular oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
6214323 but a thousand banks is going to be a lot
6214324 each dollar of bank equity that gets lost takes out about 12 or 13 dollars of loans so theres a tremendous magnifier effect of small changes in bank equity

6214345 i just needed another medium another way to be creative i needed a new boyfriend to bring the old butterflies back
6214346 i felt relaxed i didnt feel any pressure at all i took my time and in taking my time things happened so quickly i know thats strange but thats how it happened i didnt have to go through the hustle and bustle and fuss of finding another engineer i have a home studio but i didnt use it that much because i was able to maneuver things by myself on the mac in four months i had three albums seventy something songs and 20 to 50 more ideas
6214347 i got on ichat and all my friends started sending me mp3 tracks and asking me to come up with vocals and lyrics
6214348 they told me that i could basically layer my vocals in garageband like i used to do with my old four track
6214349 im an analog girl so it was easy to relate
6214350 i learned how to use garageband by trial and error
6214351 i hate reading instructions so i just figured it out it took the amount of time that i dragged the mp3 into a track its like somebody stuck a plug in the back of my neck and uploaded a program to learn how to use garageband it was automatic everything on that mac was automatic
6214352 i started writing so much so quickly and so independently of people disturbing me
6214353 it was just me my headphones and my laptop i could be anywhere as long as i had some juice and write music
6214354 the music inspires me i listen to the music im in it i hear it and i begin to hum a melody as im humming a melody i begin to find a rhythm for the melody there has to be space between the kick and the snare for what im saying its all about finding a space where i belong soon that humming and rhythm breaks into syllables and i just find words that match the syllables of the melody it somehow all makes sense
6214355 9th wonder would send me a track and i would put some vocals on it put a tambourine on it or something then 9th wonder would im it to james poyser who would put some keys on it poyser would im it back to me and id write a hook id send it all to mike chavarria and he would dump everything to two inch tape to get a nice warm analog sound
6214356 i got a little creative and went to the guitar plug ins and the drum plug ins
6214357 those effects give my voice a flange y sound that gives me a feeling of 1969 to 1973 sonically i was trying to create something that didnt sound too new but everyone knew was new by putting the vocals through effects that are not for vocals of course youre going to get something kinda freaky
6214358 i used photo booth camera and did stop animation i did about 500 still photos of me just moving slightly left and right put them all together and added effects in imovie it took about three hours and i never left my bedroom i took it to the label to give them an idea of what i wanted to do with some of the videos for this album
6214359 i wanted to do something where im using old record covers because i know so many people collect records
6214360 so i just came up with this little storyline ive never used as many post production effects in my life once again im in this digital mode placing myself on these albums and making it look real it was such a learning experience for me
6214361 ive always cross processed my slide film to bring effects to my unique shots i was never a digital camera girl but everybody has to change sometime im still in love with analog things but this is just another part of me
6214362 i enjoy experiencing the natural music that comes out of me on stage its like getting your feet rubbed or smelling rain its why i do what i do
6214363 ill continue to put my touches on new amerykah part two by singing and stacking vocals and creating effects in garageband and logic
6214364 and if anybody sends me more tracks ill put vocals on those too
6214365 garageband really gave me the freedom and the time to live while i worked
6214366 to me living is the little things you do in between working like stopping and smelling the flowers or risking being late because youre finishing up listening to an album with the mac i have time and the freedom to do all those things and write my music without going into a studio
6214367 t mobile is working with the industry to foster an open wireless services platform which will provide developers with the tools and information they need to make new innovative experiences available to more than 31 5 million customers
6214368 what interesting or out of the ordinary things have you ever done to get connected to the internet and or company network when working remotely
6214369 had to climb on my mothers roof once it was so fun i actually saw a naked neighbor girl
6214370 drove 15 miles away from old faithful geyser to achieve a complete internet connection due to static from geyser emissions energy
6214371 driven to the local coffee shop and purchased a muffin to use their wireless
6214372 had to hack into a phone line at a hotel to get dial up to work many years ago
6214373 i have plugged my laptop into a hospital ethernet line because the wireless was down
6214374 i have researched hotels that do not provide internet but are nearby wireless hubs to get connection freely
6214375 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
6214376 logged into hotel conference rooms to get the connection for free
6214377 paid for a cab ride while i worked on the internet
6214378 plugged into electricity from the city of seattle that was on a pole on the sidewalk but only for a few minutes
6214379 held my laptop out a window to get the wi fi next door so i could send an important email
6214380 sat outside an airport for 4 hours so i could use the free wireless across the street
6214381 ive done a lot of crazy things but ill never be able to admit it or id lose my dignity
6214382 moved throughout my home because of connection problems i found myself sitting in a ducky chair in my toddlers room because that is where i got the best connection
6214383 microsoft is one of the only vendor s with top enterprise search and business intelligence reporting capabilities it offers strong support for aggregation summarization search engine and dashboards transactions across distributed data sources and long running transactions are also strengths for microsoft
6214384 market share business intelligence platform software asia pacific and japan 2007 report said that microsoft leads the market with 20
6214385 based on idcs recent report worldwide relational database management systems revenue by vendor 2007 although the top three vendors had somewhat similar growth rates microsoft was leading the pack in terms of year on year growth idc sees similar trends in malaysia and most asia pacific countries where the rdbms relational database management system market growth ranges between one to 30 percent
6214386 we saw a 35 percent improvement in throughput on the system that we upgraded to sql server 2008 with no code changes on our end this translates straight to the bottom line for us as the more documents we can upload the more we can process

6214389 this compromise budget proposal puts our state on the road to fiscal sanity and will give california a budget that works
6214390 substituting one tax increase for another is not a bipartisan compromise nor will it solve our long term budget problems
6214391 increasing taxes on hard working californians whether temporary or permanent is not only unnecessary it is irresponsible
6214392 i have made it very clear that we cannot tax our way out of this problem i do not believe in tax increases
6214393 i dont want to go back and ask them for any tax increases they deserve better than that
6214394 i think it is key for us that we finish this year with victories and not another year where nothing gets done just because everyone is stuck in their ideology
6214395 with almost no resources and only the burning ambition to become a lawyer
6214396 good family people we traditionally like to learn and to attend school we are hard working of course because we were under spain so long the filipino people traditionally love music and dance
6214397 i was with my cousin when i came from the philippines his brother worked at the davenport hotel in the philippines at that time
6214398 there were a lot of young men who had to come to this country to get work there were not enough jobs in the philippines also we had many young men of adventurous spirit the young women were too shy to come you must remember we were all brought up under spanish customs and women were very modest i was in my teens when i came so i went to lewis and clark high school to complete my senior year then came the depression and i never got to college as id planned
6214399 during the depression i worked washing dishes at edgecliff sanitorium for 3 50 a week
6214400 then i was laid off and i went to work as a bus boy and dishwasher for the carolina restaurant then near the orpheum theater on howard street i stayed there till i went to the spokane country club in 1932
6214401 i was working in the pantry at the blue spruce restaurant
6214402 tommy saw me be he wasnt very courageous he invited me out but i was only 17 and as was our custom in spanish families i told him we would have to ask my father it took him a whole month before he asked my dad when he did my dad said all right you can take her to church and when it is over you bring her right back that was our first date we were married about a year and a half later after the war the spokane country club wanted tommy back so we moved back to spokane we lived in a house on the country club grounds
6214403 with two cousins in may 1925 we had 180 filipino passengers on the ship as soon as we landed in seattle we all scattered very few of us had anyone to meet us we stayed one night in seattle then my second cousin came from tacoma and took us to live with that family a month then we got a hotel room and kept looking for jobs finally i found a job in alaska for three months in a salmon cannery i made 65 a month for three months plus board and room after three months my contract ended and i came back to seattle in a few days i found work at providence hospital as a pantry boy and dishwasher i earned 1 a day plus board and room i stayed there 10 years all through the depression can you imagine how many people there were in breadlines then in seattle after 10 years i decided to come to spokane right away tommy rosario got me a job at the spokane country club we were waiters and janitors at the same time we cleaned the place in the morning and then became waiters the only reason i quit after five months was that i found a job at the spokane elks club as water and barman i stayed there 19 years
6214404 i next tended bar at the university club until entering the u s navy in 1942 i went back to the philippines but we couldnt get leave to go off the ship because we were all set to take part in the invasion of japan our ship was full of marines the war ended so we then took them to japan for occupation duty
6214405 manage the bar at the clarkston country club in 1962 i returned to spokane
6214406 the young people are very americanized the americanism is fine we are all very loyal americans but we wish they knew more of the old ways and things
6214407 when tommy went back to the philippines to visit after 50 years there was a whole bus full of relations and neighbors of his family who came to meet him the family unit is very important there
6214408 the philippines even the smallest occasion is a reason for a party to see your friends most parties are in the homes we love to welcome people to our homes margaret is right about the importance of family we were all brought up of course by spanish customs its very different in the united states here when young people become 17 or 18 theyre gone
6214409 in our minds both collisions were caused by both drivers going much too fast for the conditions
6214410 these are people who lost their lives people with families
6214411 after attempts to work something out with countrywide i was unable to do so a short sale from my home is pending acceptance by countrywide and there is an offer to purchase the property communications with countrywide are continuing
6214412 of course the pressure and the questions will increase but i have enough confidence in what i am doing to carry on with the job
6214413 in the final of the copa america last year we beat argentina 3 0 and now it is our turn to lose
6214414 the companys philosophy is to be green conscious and wed like our customers to think that way too
6214415 in the face of a 26 year high annual inflation rate and rising costs of basic necessities food petrol transportation it would be unrealistic to expect singaporeans confidence to be sustained at previous levels
6214416 around 10 years ago we presented to richard at his house it was one of those no pressure situations as we had spent the previous year researching products at richards expense travelling the world and staying in nice hotels mr bucknall said
6214417 we presented and it was met with a deathly silence before richard finally said i think it is bloody fantastic
6214418 there are many examples in the current industry where people get locked into the wrong type of membership we are very big on flexible contracts mr blackman said
6214419 aside from that i think we will have gym facilities that are a cut above what exists in the local market
6214420 for famous females like gisele bundchen and angelina jolie outperform the dow according to one russian womans
6214421 which is why we kept listening unpacking his phrases sure that whatever came out no matter how gnomic contained multitudes
6214422 should the merger not eventuate or not be completed in the timeframe envisaged moodys has stated that there would be potential for downward pressure on our deposit and debt ratings
6214423 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
6214424 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the external environment represents an excellent achievement
6214425 it demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
6214426 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
6214427 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance
6214428 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
6214429 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want
6214430 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make a decision that unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
6214431 i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while thats why i made the smart choice with a smart beer stampede light its beer plus
6214432 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6214433 im happy because we played a long time for an hour that i liked but the counter attack the czechs used was very dangerous
6214434 i learned that when the other team uses the counter attack we have some problems
6214435 we are at the start of the season and some of the players are not at the top physically
6214436 im not too happy with it but ill be back for 2012
6214437 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard ive been through a lot of ups and downs but ive seen a lot of good things along the way
6214438 i was able to use the negativism in a good light and say after my accident i can still do it if i work hard you have to set dreams set goals and never give up
6214439 i was swimming next to her and she beat me and she has one leg
6214440 i have got two weeks to prepare for that and i will celebrate tonight with some junk food maybe an ice cream
6214441 i had a few people who told me after the accident that this wouldnt be possible but i was fortunate enough to get back to swimming
6214442 i think it is reasonably certain that he is gone and i dont think there is much doubt about that and there is talk about jim babcock going as well
6214443 but i dont think this is going to rescue shareholders in any shape or form
6214444 baybeats was launched primarily to create a platform to showcase independent musicians especially local musicians
6214445 it gives our audience a chance to listen for free to a wide range of alternative music acts they might not otherwise have a chance to see
6214446 were probably one of the bigger alternative music festivals in singapore something that people can look forward to every year
6214447 weve worked with wake me up music for a long time and its director john chiong wanted to take a break from some of his commitments and we respect his decision
6214448 it was not because of any bad blood or anything i think the esplanade felt it was just time to take the reins on their own maybe they felt its been kind of the same for a while i guess so maybe this is a different phase its a pretty bold move
6214449 we were also keen to build and develop the festival further on our own the festivals brand is well established and it was time to push it further in terms of grooming local artists
6214450 the new local indie band showcase has been a component that has done well and we are continually looking at ways to improve the festival such that it develops our local artists and audiences further
6214451 year after year the festival aims to function as a showcase platform and a launch pad for independent talents in the local scene
6214452 we were actually supposed to choose 10 but the standard was really so high we couldnt kick out the last one
6214453 theyre all really good theyre very ambitious and they seem to be playing at a level thats higher than most
6214454 preparations are not that ideal but its not too long a set and were playing all the old stuff that everybody knows so it shouldnt be that difficult
6214455 you can catch our first film screening in baybeats history
6214456 they were carefully chosen for their involvement in local music and film some which also feature a cast of artistes from the local music scene
6214457 our main aim is to cater to the needs and tastes of different audience segments enhancing their experience through the arts we showcase quality indie music and grow the audience for this genre while giving our local bands and regional talents a place to be profiled
6214458 for baybeats to be sustainable and successful we have to look at a variety of other objectives as well like the quality of performances the ability of the audience to appreciate the performances through the years as well as the benefit that artistes get out of collaborations and networking
6214459 of course we hope to draw as many people as possible to the festival but there is a physical limit to the number we can accommodate due to site constraints
6214460 baybeats is for everybody its one of those festivals where it doesnt matter what music you like if youre interested in music you should just go youll feel the energy slapping you
6214461 i would say were all cut from the same cloth you know the indie spirit the punk rock ethos its the same even though the genres might be different the spirit is there which is what baybeats is all about
6214462 we did consider paternity leave and when we studied other countries with paternity leave like the scandinavian countries we find that the great majority of men dont take it
6214463 i think we have signalled that through increasing the childcare leave and also providing the unpaid infant care leave
6214464 fortunately all of us are married so we do understand women and we have children so we do understand what it means to bring up a family
6214465 a lot of the measures that have been implemented are in direct response to the feedback that we have received
6214466 there has always been a wish that legislation will address the problems but discrimination can take on a very subtle form
6214467 so i think we would be able to manage it as we introduce these measures
6214468 its a big cost for us and the experience makes me wary of hiring married women
6214469 im a father and i know its important for mothers to be with their child but it needs to be fair for employers too
6214470 prefer not to hire a woman because they will have to think about who will cover for her
6214471 given that the companys liquidity is subject to its ability to negotiate extensions of credit facilities
6214472 we will give figures when centro and centro retail trust report their full year results next friday

6214475 they hadnt no more than closed the door than the cat hit the cricket and took off
6214476 he turned the water over and i saw his tail was about as wide as my two hands
6214477 by the time she got back out there she said papa youre going to break my rod because it was bent double
6214478 squealed and her eyes got as big as silver dollars
6214479 he always tells me to be strong and it will be ok
6214480 im thinking of my sons and im also thinking back when i knew dan when he was nine or 10 years old
6214481 i can only imagine what these families are going through
6214482 its the one thing i dont want to go through
6214483 id like to meet different party leaders id like to meet other people from other states
6214484 i am looking forward to attending as many caucuses as possible especially those dealing with problems of rural and agricultural areas and other issues
6214485 they are an opportunity to network with groups you work with and meet with groups that you may not have the best relations with
6214486 i use it as a way to meet a lot of different people across the country
6214487 its really the one time when all of the republicans in california get together in one place
6214488 as a hill staffer its an opportunity to pick up new skills network and grow professionally
6214489 but in the last couple of weeks there have been reports that the take up rate of residences by foreign developers have seen an improvement
6214490 current consensus is that economicconditions and business sentiments would improve and return to normality by the second half of next year
6214491 while i have been more a bear i have been surprised by the demand for housing and office space in recent weeks
6214492 most vietnamese still come with bags of cash to make their mortgage payments
6214493 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography hes a p o w
6214494 my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6214495 have gotten so cynical that theyre not sure the democrats are going to fix problems any more than the republicans
6214496 let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6214497 sen obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
6214498 but when i bring our troops home they will come home with honor and victory leaving iraq secured as a democratic ally in the arab heartland
6214499 today we reached the height of hypocrisy when john mccain questioned sen obamas record
6214500 sen mccain cheered president bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war that had nothing to do with 9 11
6214501 is one of the least experienced candidates in the last hundred years if not the least experienced
6214502 diplomatically and politically and with negotiations and with economic pressure
6214503 i think john mccain has the experience thats needed for our safety
6214504 dont spend a lot of time defending their record because they cant theyre not going to argue the issues
6214505 the introduction of auralexs eco tech is the next step in our ongoing initiative to become a more earth conscious company by refining our products and practices
6214506 alongside our eco friendly approach in manufacturing auralex is proud to do its part in conserving our resources by printing collateral materials on recycled paper and by using recycled materials for the shipment of our products

6214511 look lets take our time lets build fewer bikes lets build them properly so they dont leak oil and theyll run forever
6214512 im trying to keep the work interesting i might try and take some courses maybe try for another degree
6214513 the last time i got bored i applied for another job
6214514 if whats outside of the job is more interesting the job becomes too much of a hindrance
6214515 our supernova optical screen technology allows consumers to watch movies and experience gaming in any environment without having to make accommodations for darkness or ambient light
6214516 the perfect projection screen solution for todays home theater our proprietary screen material enhances contrast without creating an optical illusion like traditional standard screens the result is a true white and a darker gray
6214517 rather than attacking former prime minister jean chr tien for simply voicing his opinion on our relationship with china prime minister harper should make more of an effort to build bridges with one of the worlds fastest growing economies
6214518 attending the closing ceremonies would send a message of constructive engagement
6214519 after all this time what difference does it make what direction theyre facing as long as theyre not blocking the street
6214520 my husband did get a ticket for parking the wrong way and understandably it is breaking the law but i think in a village like this where were use to getting away with a warning would have been the more appropriate way
6214521 if its the law it needs to be abided by but just let someone know
6214522 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6214523 it is getting critical to where time now becomes more of an issue for just the physical part of getting ready for the opener
6214524 every day we miss now does start to factor in as to what the workload will be from the start
6214525 will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
6214526 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
6214527 the stock is just going back to where it should have been
6214528 as hard as novatel tried to push introduction ahead these new products are now expected to launch
6214529 intensifying competition in several of its key markets continued transition of its product portfolio and lack of near term catalysts

6214531 why dont you just call your mom and she will not be charged

6214537 i need a pay raise i need a pay raise
6214538 were not trying to convince those who dont want babies to have babies we are helping those who already want to have babies to have more babies if they choose to do so
6214539 were not buying babies what we are doing is empowering people to make choices whether its the right partner having kids how to bring up their children whether they want to work even the choice of reproductive technologies
6214540 childcare subsidies are useful so its good to see it doubled it can add up to 400 plus every month so the bigger subsidy of 300 can save us a lot
6214541 but there are a lot of women out there like me who leave their jobs because we dont want to farm out our children to childcares maids and grandparents we want to be fully involved in raising our children
6214542 there are lot of us who are educated and have skills so why cant there be support to help mothers start home businesses
6214543 the difference between the two is the attitude of the people towards marriage and having babies and in our instance we know that many singaporeans want to put ther career first
6214544 after having worked for 20 30 years and spent your life contributing to one company or bringing profit for the company when you retire what do you have left other than savings your house your car and well what else do you look forward to

6214550 the rubble is still in my face on the ground
6214551 the occupation still continues the civil administration talks about the law what kind of law they are breaking the law
6214552 we sell our tomatoes for 15 nis on the road but only 5 to 7 nis in the market

6214554 right wing media were fomenting a wave of nationalism and chauvinism and were provoking an anti communist and anti soviet psychosis

6214557 they went out to the hallway and came back a few minutes later and he had again placed the pillow over the gentlemans face
6214558 at no time was it determined that he attempted to apply pressure
6214559 abuse on the elderly they should do something about that
6214560 there was nothing that you could get upset about because they handled it in a very very mannerly way
6214561 los incidentes m s graves se produjeron en la tarde en la ciudad de santa cruz cuando decenas de activistas del grupo autonomista uni n juvenil cruce ista ujc trataron de hacer cumplir la huelga en un populoso barrio conocido por su apoyo al presidente morales
6214562 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of re education through labour can she serve
6214563 but they can also be taken away at any time
6214564 i feel most at home when i sing a lot of frank sinatra stuff the heavy ballads or the musicals theyre just so comfortable to do
6214565 i want to stay put for a couple of years
6214566 back in australia we thought asian food was sweet and sour pork or lemon chicken and when i came here everything was bursting with flavours
6214567 i grew up with a karaoke system those really big ones that play cassette tapes wed have karaoke parties almost every week

6214570 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6214571 there are reports of some movement out of gori and were going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal of if this is some sort of token effort designed for you and others to report on
6214572 well see i think its too early for us to determine whether or not this is really the russians committing to withdrawing their forces
6214573 according to akp foreign policy doctrine turkey with it strategic depth turkey with its geographic depth turkeys with its economic power military power should certainly play a leading role in the region including the middle east turkey should play a part in africa and should play a part in central asia the balkans etc turkey should become a global power in the long run
6214574 given a choice turkey would be more close with russia india and china even the islamic world
6214575 that doesnt mean turkey would break all relationships with the west they are looking for some new power to balance its european union relationship
6214576 they dont want us because of culture religion living style it is all about us
6214577 this shows prejudice to our country but i believe turkey does not need the european union to be a powerful or strong country
6214578 if you want to save your self in the country then the eu is your only guarantee for you
6214579 the akp knows very well that if they dont get back track with the eu process if they dont continue their commitment with the eu process they are going to lose their support from the intellectuals circles and from the business circles
6214580 they may not want us but that does not matter as long as we fulfill the necessary requirements
6214581 as long as we become a fully democratic country with all the human rights observed then i dont think it matters lot whether eu accepts or not
6214582 porque quer a saber m s sobre este fant stico divulgador que hab a escrito much simos libros de ciencia e incluso algunos de historia y por otra parte hab a escrito una gran saga de libros de ciencia ficci n desde mi punto de vista muy interesantes y que son una visi n de futuro
6214583 caught shortly after receiving a bribe of over rm123 400 to speed up the processing of a housing project
6214584 indicates the possibility that the individuals involved may have been victims of entrapment
6214585 the timing of the arrests could be meant to target anwar
6214586 we also fear that this could be a concerted effort to undermine the stability of the perak state government
6214587 now the aca is very active and i am happy with that especially with the increase in the number of enforcement officers
6214588 these have been exciting times and i have so many memories from the last few months
6214589 i said michael would not be able to do it only because of the competition
6214590 i think luck plays a role and you look at the 4x100m freestyle relay against the french it was very lucky and in the 100 butterfly
6214591 but what michael has done is wonderful never in my life did i think i would see such an achievement
6214592 i was always 100 per cent sure michael would do it
6214593 everything was down to michael it was all about what michael wanted to do
6214594 it was up to him and from day one when he won the 400 individual medley i knew he had everything under control
6214595 i always thought anything is possible and it was a matter of getting down to it working hard
6214596 when someone says it is not possible i like that it fires me up it motivates me
6214597 its been a crazy few weeks and i can say ive been happy to be here
6214598 what are two words that instantly come to mind when you think president
6214599 what are two words that instantly come to mind when you think hillary clinton
6214600 what are two words that instantly come to mind when you think john mccain
6214601 what are two words that instantly come to mind when you think barak obama
6214602 do you think barak obama seems like the obvious winner of novembers election
6214603 what do you think would be the hardest thing about being president
6214604 where do you think you get the most of your information about presidential politics
6214605 if a candidate could have one plan that would fix one problem perfectly that would serve the greatest betterment of the country what would that issue be
6214606 if you think you are going to vote or maybe youre not sure what would be the one thing that would definitely get you to the polls in november
6214607 i dont think hell break it here i will be shocked if he does to run 19 30s hes going to have to run the curve a lot better and hold his speed to the line but then i didnt think he was going to run 9 69s
6214608 last saturdays win was definitely a plus point for us
6214609 the boys are ready and i am confident we can go out there and do something
6214610 but this is a cup game so league form counts for nothing here
6214611 woodlands have got players like park tae won laakkad abdelhadi and akihiro nakamura so my boys will need mental and physical strengths to handle them they have to go out there and earn their place and show they deserve to be in the finals
6214612 they the chinese have a lot of hardware but no software this gives me the confidence to work in china most of the magazines are very badly done in china they dont concentrate a lot on photographic work and the design area
6214613 so i looked for publications and did design layouts enhancements for them a lot of publishers looked for me and asked me to take over their pre press work
6214614 previously we were considered a medium seized printing outfit but with some reports running to millions of copies we are now in the big league
6214615 we are proud to leverage on our 30 years of unique print management business track record with still the one same well established xpress brand
6214616 the international xpress brand will continue to underpin the companys growth from niche to niche with more value add service products larger geographic footprint stronger financial performance and higher shareholder value
6214617 capitalise on your strengths identify your market understand your clients needs and their clients needs and surpass their expectations
6214618 im not worried about veronica running a fast time i wanted as slow a time as possible to save it all for tomorrow
6214619 my preparation is going well we have to wait and see what happens in the final
6214620 i wasnt going out there to win but i thought when i was leading why not just go out and win it
6214621 i slutet av veckan vet vi var vi st r
6214622 as business and leisure travel are increasingly common in singapore we thought the best way of celebrating our anniversary is to share our travel knowledge as a one stop travel store

6214625 aussies were flamin mad last night as team gb continued to lead them in the olympic medals race
6214626 and despite jibes about poms only being able to win at sitting down sports australian pride really was smarting
6214627 once not so long ago australians were a proud people who walked tall with jutted jaws
6214628 the poms were a source of amusement a fallen imperial master weeping over a dog eared scrapbook its tattered images of steve redgrave seb coe mary rand and those blokes from chariots of fire fading by the day
6214629 at the start of the second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6214630 we know they are a good team they execute very well but our biggest strength is our depth we are going to wear you down
6214631 we want to play the best we want to play the defending champs that is what we came here for to play the best competition
6214632 you can call it do or die but it is go time that is what we came here for the money is on the line
6214633 we further believe the consolidation was not an impulsive decision but rather had been under review for the past year
6214634 however tween brands remains the only player in the tween space that serves this customer exclusively
6214635 im leaving early to go to the hospital for an operation
6214636 yuegu couldnt take her serve and lost a few points there
6214637 wu xue is left handed and the spin from the serve is different wu also played above her standard today but the main reason for yuegus loss is that she just couldnt take the serve
6214638 the matches went quite well today but tomorrow will be tougher for the players as they have two matches each in the morning and afternoon
6214639 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
6214640 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6214641 the harry potter thing is useful because there will be a lot of people whove never been to the theater before and if we can bring them to the theater thats amazing
6214642 they were show horses and they were such beautiful creatures
6214643 so powerful i personally think blinding so many horses is impossible because if you blind one itll kick you in the head and youre out
6214644 there are more people in therapy in this country than england so you get it
6214645 instead if he had questions hed consult with either playwright peter shaffer or his co star richard griffiths who also plays harrys uncle vernon in the potter films
6214646 he has the most brilliant encyclopedic knowledge that anyone could ever possess and he never imposes it on you
6214647 so instead of his dad being a communist and such we leave it at they had a great marriage
6214648 the play asks a question why and its a question for which no one has the answer
6214649 his default setting is that hes got this malcolm mcdowell rage so when you show his human side hes more interesting
6214650 if you saw us in rehearsal you might think it was a comedy
6214651 offended mothers were calling up and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to go see it
6214652 ok dont see it theyre treating it like its pornography and its not its only seven minutes at the end of the play when im naked and im 19 now
6214653 youre in there and there are these hooves flying around and im naked by that point its terrifying that scene is one of the most shocking pieces of theater and i deserve very little credit for that those horses are amazing
6214654 i asked him how do you memorize all those lines
6214655 and he told me to just learn them in rehearsal so i did about a month before by the time opening night came i knew everyone elses lines too
6214656 and it would be really hard to do this without him were both onstage the entire length of the play were there for each others scenes as spectators so we developed a kind of kinship
6214657 were never in situations in films where we have to save each other
6214658 or to stop each other from making public embarrassments of ourselves you know when an actor pauses whether its for dramatic effect or its a forgotten line you can see the panic behind the eyes
6214659 it only happened once but my horseman will kemp had me on his shoulders and he was supposed to run and jump off a block
6214660 but he missed his footing and instead of hitting here he hit there and the blocks slid across the stage the whole audience went whoa and i was just laughing out of pure terror but he managed to keep me on his shoulders
6214661 its the same reason to go see live music for those little moments
6214662 id encouraged joe not to do it but hes his own man
6214663 he sides with democrats on so many issues but it troubles me that he would do this but once this is over i hope we can come together again and find common ground
6214664 few members of congress have shown the insight to understand the importance of this sweeping legislation to restrain the federal government and even fewer have shown the courage to cosponsor this bill
6214665 whiskey and gunpowder is brought to you by a team of rebellious brigands exploring commodities politics technology nature history and much more it offers investment ideas and analysis you wont find in the mainstream media
6214666 things like equipment stress industrial action and wage disputes labor and equipment shortages inflationary pressures and then infrastructural problems
6214667 we expect a recovery in copper prices primarily based on lower than expected supplies
6214668 the daily resource plus was designed from the start to be the worlds most comprehensive yet quick reading daily e letter providing concise updates on precious metals energy resource stocks currencies unfolding economic trends and more including private placement financings
6214669 people toil to make ends meet we dont have a healthy attitude were so caught up in the rat race
6214670 people take for granted simple tasks like marketing cooking getting from your flat to the clinic if you have a stroke youll need someone to cook for you someone to take you to the clinic for therapy the built in environment is very unfriendly for people with physical immobility and theres the cost of these services
6214671 going somewhere more affordable allows us to stretch our dollar in bigger countries people move to the hinterland so singaporeans are doing the same thing by retiring in bintan or elsewhere
6214672 ive many friends who want to come back they complain their children are not filial and not looking after them and the support system is different
6214673 a river cruise in provence is for people of leisure

6214696 housing down more and inflation up are negative for crude oil
6214697 the european economy is having similar problems to ours which is negative for oil consumption

6214709 more consolidation in the gold market looks necessary and a weekly close above 850 will be needed prior to the primary trend reasserting itself and the important short term influences on gold will be whether the dollar can keep strengthening and whether oil prices continue to fall

6214733 do you know why we call the promised land eretz yisrael
6214734 we call it eretz yisrael because every jew who goes to this land sees the truth about himself the land acts as a mirror reflecting his true spiritual status back at him the reason you feel cold about eretz yisrael is not because that is the lands true identity since nothing could be further than the truth you feel cold because you are spiritually apathetic if a jew who goes to eretz yisrael cant find any good attribute which he can report this bears a very telling witness about the true state of his spirituality

6214744 but while we are still good friends i am a professional with a job to do and come match day i will be on a mission for my team
6214745 tactics play a big part in winning games but in a cup match like this it will also be the emotions and nerves of the players that will be key
6214746 the speaker of the house i most admire is tip oneill despite their differences he was able to work in a bipartisan way with president reagan to save social security this was possible because they were both willing to listen and to compromise

6214749 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
6214750 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
6214751 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
6214752 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
6214753 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
6214754 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling

6214765 ni siquiera s c mo se aprueban este tipo de iniciativas me enter por un periodista y por tel fono de lo que estaba sucediendo
6214766 s lo s que hubo una reuni n de la comisi n de r gimen interno donde los presidentes de las bancadas a puertas cerradas acordaron este bono que ya es un hecho

6214773 eso extenderse a todos los sueldos altos de la administraci n p blica de ministros subsecretarios intendentes o parlamentarios ya que hemos llegado a un nivel de diferencia en la escala de salarios muy grande y abismante

6214789 all you had to do wednesday night was substitute the word jew with black though southerners would have chosen a different term but that was the tone
6214790 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6214791 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6214792 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6214793 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6214794 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6214795 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6214796 has our increasingly paranoid society declared war on the humble weekend snapper
6214797 an amateur photographer is chased by the police after taking pictures on the seafront another man is frogmarched away when using his camera in a town centre since when did carrying a camera in public provoke so much suspicion and hostility
6214798 the police were responding to a 999 call from someone who claimed to have seen rigg taking photographs in a public park earlier that afternoon they had tracked him from a control centre on a series of cctv cameras before sending the squad car out to apprehend him
6214799 the association of chief police officers acpo is unequivocal on the matter police officers may not prevent someone from taking a photograph in public unless they suspect criminal or terrorist intent they say in a statement

6214812 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6214813 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6214814 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6214815 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6214816 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6214817 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification

6214828 watching television can slow the development of children under three even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6214829 television viewing hurts the development of children under three years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6214830 one of reasons we created babyfirsttv is that we thought there was no good programming for babies on tv and according to the research that is out there most of the babies are watching tv anyway
6214831 sorry love but you shouldnt really be doing that you know

6214850 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6214851 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6214852 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6214853 i would never trade one of my silvers johnson said
6214854 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6214855 ich wei was deine br ste letzten sommer getan haben

6214859 i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt and im just so disappointed ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
6214860 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i just couldnt maintain control so i just crashed and burned
6214861 last season i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
6214862 my hamstring really let me down and i feel like ive worked so hard in vain
6214863 i know for sure im in 48 second shape so hopefully ill get a chance to go for gold on the relay
6214864 i think one of the most important issues is that people overlook the significance of water this isnt about shortages of water nor is it about quality specifically its about recognition of the fact that water permeates every aspect of our life from manufacturing to growing food to health care to sustaining life itself
6214865 i wanted so much to do well for the people of china their support helped me so much and i hope i made them proud
6214866 four years ago i had perfect preparation i was injury free and i felt great
6214867 this time i had to fight myself out of a ginormous hole this silver medal is gold for me
6214868 am i tired of sixth i dont look at it that way
6214869 no its not the placement i wanted but i went all out
6214870 the only time i missed it was during the meet all of them were over rotated i just couldnt correct that
6214871 i looked around at all my teammates eyes thats what we do we play great defense
6214872 lets just say none of us are doing this for the money said center forward kami craig
6214873 sam raimi geht soll franco jetzt das neue gesicht von cia agent jack ryan werden
6214874 playing australia gave us a chance to personally touch some of those players
6214875 how quick patrick mills was how really good david andersen is why hes one of the best players in europe how well chris anstey can still shoot
6214876 theyre a good team over the last three games averaging over 100 points a game 40 of those coming on threes so theyre shooting the heck out of the ball
6214877 i need to finish a lot better than i did today i need to have a perfect race and probably a little luck
6214878 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter
6214879 once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
6214880 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
6214881 my goal is different we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
6214882 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
6214883 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me
6214884 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think the cowboys did that

6214890 but its heating up people are starting to get really worried
6214891 simple conventions for embedding semantic markup in human readable documents
6214892 well im doing it right its the browsers problem not mine
6214893 an attempt to get everyone to change their behavior and rewrite their tools
6214894 they allow the embedding of parsable semantic data like contact information and event details into regular web pages with the right plug in that information can be saved directly to your calendar program or address book
6214895 offers advisory information about the element for which it is set
6214896 opening the floodgates to custom dtds and namespaces would quickly raise the complexity level of microformats to that of rdf greatly reducing its adoption and therefore its relevance
6214897 it strikes me that it would be trivially easily for screen readers to parse this data and read it back in a human friendly manner
6214898 an attempt to get everyone to change their behavior and rewrite their tools
6214899 a whole new approach that throws away what already works today
6214900 one of the tenants of microformats is that the content shouldnt be hidden or at least not completely
6214901 jaws can be configured to read expansions provided in title attributes of abbreviations independently of other elements so a title attribute on a span is not necessarily read out
6214902 as a fan of both microformats and rdf i find this gratuitous and misinformed opening the floodgates to custom dtds and namespaces would quickly raise the complexity level of microformats to that of rdf greatly reducing its adoption and therefore its relevance
6214903 introducing a new design pattern page id call it the title design pattern
6214904 2007 03 27t12 00 00 06 00 can make sense read aloud its not like the information disappears
6214905 i still dont get why this is so long and drawn out there are some simple solutions to every problem raised
6214906 this is something that the microformats community is aware of and has been looking into

6214908 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6214909 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6214911 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
6214912 the united states is the land of opportunity its the best country in the world and im just glad to represent it
6214913 who would have thought this could be possible for someone with my background but i set my goal i trained hard i just put the pieces together and i really believed in myself
6214914 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to go all the way
6214915 we always moved forward my mom always taught us to suck it up and whatever you want to do you can do
6214916 some people dont understand the sacrifice how much blood sweat and tears go into getting that gold
6214917 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment he came from
6214918 could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that
6214919 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6214920 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6214922 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6214923 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
6214924 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me
6214925 it happened so quick its just kind of a shock to me and its something ill deal with
6214926 i never expected this i knew this was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6214927 i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6214928 oh lord they say wallace spearmon stepped out the second place guy stepped out well hopefully usain stepped out too so that means ill go home with the gold
6214929 not the way i wanted to go home with it but if two people stepped out hey thats a gold medal for me
6214930 starting to do 400 hurdles i hated it i totally despised it
6214931 i know that i deserved that gold medal and the ncaa they took it
6214932 i was devastated and i didnt let it go until today
6214933 but i came out with the gold and the record i dont believe theres a happier woman on earth than i am right now
6214934 i think the credit goes to the fact we start out competing so young
6214935 i was on a track team when i was 7 years old in jamaica it starts young in jamaica
6214936 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6214937 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6214938 i guess its bittersweet in a way because id love to stay but im excited about whats to come
6214939 yeah i think im going to take him up on that
6214940 during the top 24 some of the judges had mentioned you know being from toronto youve got to get them behind you and i think my family really single handedly won over the city especially getting the mayor endorsing me that was kind of cool i think that helped me a lot
6214941 im pissed off about the show last night i was a big fan of mookies finally theres signs all over the beaches and leaside and rosedale and lawrence park and moore park its really really been exciting to see toronto get engaged and voting so aggressively
6214942 i will stake my reputation on the fact that mookie will get a record contract guaranteed with a major record label
6214943 if you dont see what you want here ask your local library for access
6214944 vi har kommit en bra bit l ngre p v g n vad vi hade t nkt oss det verkar som om vi har lyckats g ra n got som fungerar
6214945 there are six billion people in the world each of whom sees facts differently
6214946 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6214947 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6214948 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6214949 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6214950 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6214951 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6214952 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6214953 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6214954 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6214955 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6214956 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6214957 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6214958 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6214959 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6214960 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6214961 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6214962 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6214963 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6214964 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6214965 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6214966 i know he wishes he could be bigger for football but he has a great build
6214967 nyk can shift his feet in traffic very well avoiding the tacklers
6214968 he also has the ability to shift his feet in a different gear when needed he has great vision and awareness at all times the great ones seem to have this ability
6214969 hes tried to talk me into letting him be the punter and he says he can play qb if i need him
6214970 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success
6214971 lets focus on illinois and getting better every day thats pretty much all we talk about
6214972 i know what it is going to take to be a head coach the sacrifice and commitment that my family is going to have to make for me to be the head coach so i am not going to delve into something unless i feel like we have a legitimate chance to win championships not just win games but win championships
6214973 will experience reductions while investments will be made in high growth segments of the business
6214974 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6214975 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6214976 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6214977 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6214978 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6214979 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6214980 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6214981 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6214982 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6214983 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6214984 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6214985 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6214986 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6214987 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6214988 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6214989 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6214990 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6214991 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6214992 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6214993 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6214994 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6214995 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6214996 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6214997 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6214998 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6214999 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6215000 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6215001 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6215002 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6215003 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too janjua said but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6215004 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6215005 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6215006 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6215007 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6215008 i used to not like him really i used to think this kid is arrogant something is wrong with him when i watched him wrestle in college i would tell my athletes hes terrible hes absolutely terrible even when he was winning id say that you know why id never grabbed him before and realized he does have certain skills
6215009 i like to put a lot of points on the board and i like to put on a show
6215010 you ask me if im going to beat this guy ill say yeah im going to whip his butt to me that was just me telling the truth but i didnt realize that other people didnt say that
6215011 never its off the chart off the chart its ridiculous
6215012 the other day he tells me i was thinking about fighting in the ultimate fighting championship but im just too good to stop wrestling
6215013 i didnt have the strength and power of other kids in high school
6215014 they kind of had that man strength and i had that boy strength but i always just kept working and working and im smart i realized how someone beats me and if you beat me now you might not beat me next year because im not going to let you beat me twice on the same thing
6215015 i knew i just had to fix a few parts of my game and once i did that no one in america could beat me
6215016 like i said im a thinker they were doubting me because theyre not thinkers all i had to do was take a look at the big picture and see what i needed to do and then i went and did it
6215017 after our first practice no i think it was in the middle of our first practice
6215018 when you have someone that different it can confound the international wrestlers theyre more used to a basic style he reminds me of john smith but he takes more risks than john so well see
6215019 persiguiendo a los familiares de las v ctimas del accidente de esta tarde llegando a retener a alguno de ellos asi ndolo del brazo
6215020 we tightened up our frontline defense after that first game and it allowed us to set the tempo
6215021 so we still are young and we make mistakes but were starting to play better as a team
6215022 the kids confidence level is very high much higher than its ever been i tell the kids all the time if you have confidence you can take challenges on in life
6215023 we were on cell phones and as soon as we reached 2 861 we targeted a fan at gate h
6215024 the 50 000 is great and getting the two season tickets is amazing
6215025 my buddy bought my ticket i was going to switch tickets with him in line
6215026 kobe might want to think about moving here to live
6215027 ive lost earrings chains and all kinds of stuff this time i tuck em in when i go into crowds
6215028 last year when i came here i lost an earring a kid found it on the floor and held on to it for three hours and came back and gave it back to me thats crazy
6215029 deals with coke nutella mcdonalds and spalding expired but a coke brand vitaminwater took him back
6215030 in the next year kobe will sign a deal with a blue chip company that will prove hes back near the top of the athlete endorsement world
6215031 we knew he could defend real well but he cant do all that for 110 straight games in the nba and still be asked to scored 30 points he knew we didnt need the scoring as much
6215032 thats been a huge plus for us for kobe and lebron to buy in defensively when your two best players buy into the concept that helps you a lot
6215033 i felt like thats what we were kind of missing as far as european guards big guards tearing us up a little bit
6215034 and i was sick and tired of hearing about their guard play
6215035 i wanted to come in and say you know what i dont have to score 30 some points and do dunks all that stuff i want to come in and lock some people some up
6215036 a place to really have a chance for a great accomplishment
6215037 our whole objective our whole mindset has to be now
6215038 we need to take advantage of now were not worrying about 09 10 or 11 weve got 08
6215039 there are definitely some teams that will be surprised this year
6215040 weve got things we want to do as a team
6215041 you cant go into a situation thinking or expecting bad things to happen
6215042 these guys are really doing a good job studying well competing well leading well
6215043 its a situation we feel were very fortunate so were not spending a lot of time discussing that position
6215044 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6215045 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6215046 well at least it wasnt five runs so we at least had a chance to come back
6215047 were going to see these guys the rest of the week so weve seen almost everyone theyve got hopefully weve learned something
6215048 its always difficult because you want to be out there helping your teammates he said
6215049 having to sit out you just feel kind of like youre not part of the team the guys did a good job of encouraging me but theres nothing like being out there
6215050 i cant say that we have another offensive lineman who is as skilled or who knows the offense as well as adam does said center chris hall
6215051 you want to prove everybody wrong and you want them to start believing if we can go out there and do that then i think everybodys view of us would change theyll stop ranking us in the same spot every year in the big 12 south between baylor and tech or somebody
6215052 slowly we can start creeping our way up there but we have to earn everybodys respect before that can happen
6215053 we couldnt get to the passer and we couldnt stop the run
6215054 the teams that have won it in the past have played good defense were aware of that
6215055 but you also better be able to score in this league because the majority of the teams in this league can score a lot of points
6215056 i tell our guys life asks you to be your best every day but our schedule demands it
6215057 these players have been through a lot the seniors had three different staffs in their first three years
6215058 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross
6215059 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
6215060 im not saying no popcorn is better than popcorn but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
6215061 everybody else has these different feelings or aspirations about what he should do or not do all were asking him to do is come in and embrace our culture which is be a great person graduate and help us win a national championship
6215062 that day is going to come there is no question
6215063 im not rushing that i just want him to know where to line up and how to take a handoff hes been great hes been jumping in on all kinds of special teams he wants to play that
6215064 well see im not rushing him im not putting any pressure on him to lead us to the next level i just want him to do all the right things and have fun and do things right
6215065 because were going to have some great running backs with a great ability to run the ball but were also going to have some playmaking wide receivers who can move down the field as well
6215066 darrell is a power speed back ray is more of a slasher type of guy and rodney is just a blur
6215067 that dude is so quick when he runs i dont think his heels ever touch the ground hes constantly moving forward
6215068 i dont think its burden i like it it puts colorado back out in the national scene and thats all you can ask for
6215069 darrells a humble kid he knows there is no such thing as entitlement he has to work hard in order to achieve the success that hes had before hes come in and he fits right in with the guys the guys like him they call him five star its a good match
6215070 im just adjusting to the altitude the altitude is tough but im good i just water down my body and get as many reps as i can

6215073 it is extraordinary to me that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is for ever in the way
6215074 it is out of the consolation and restoration you have brought me that these remembrances arise and pass between us and the moon on this last night
6215075 it is extraordinary to me that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is for ever in the way
6215076 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6215077 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6215078 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6215079 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6215080 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6215081 this is the most beautiful moment in my life a real dream
6215082 ive got everything ive wanted in my life what else can i ask for
6215083 i never thought there would ever be a time in my lifetime that the football coach at kansas would have to defend his schedule after beating nebraska texas a amp m colorado and virginia tech
6215084 there was a time when it was hard for kansas to show up for those games let alone win them
6215085 we want to be able to play against all the best teams in our league
6215086 and be able to beat them thats the test for our program we will never truly get over the hump in my eyes until were able to defeat those teams as well
6215087 but we are up to the challenge we cant wait to get out there and show the fans that last year wasnt a fluke were the jayhawks and were for real now
6215088 i think now we have a lot of confidence in ourselves
6215089 not that we lacked confidence before but we really expect to be on the big stage now
6215090 it takes a while to where we are winning some games its going to take hard work to keep winning games our success didnt happen overnight we dont feel like there is any chance of a falloff because our guys didnt just luck into something
6215091 such as whether one needs to perform in order for learning to have occurred or whether all human behavior is learned
6215092 four invariant stages of cognitive development that are age related
6215093 she arlin contends that formal thought actually consists of two distinct stages not one as piaget proposed
6215094 closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her social role
6215095 the ability to think critically which is mandatory to effecting a transformation is itself developmental
6215096 that it is not clear whether knowles had presented a theory of learning or a theory of teaching whether adult learning was different from child learning and whether there was a theory at all perhaps these were just principles of good practice
6215097 within companies instructional methods are designed for improving adult learners knowledge and skills it is important to distinguish the unique attributes of adult learners so as to be better able to incorporate the principles of adult learning in the design of instruction
6215098 expertise in the recognition and classification of the numerous species the flora and fauna of his or her environment
6215099 in sternbergs general theory there are three subtheories the componential subtheory the experiential subtheory and the contextual subtheory each divided into subdomains of concern the contextual subtheory deals with the context of intelligence intelligence in the real world requiring adaptation selection and or shaping the environment measurement of contextual intelligence would relate to the issue of social perception culture fairness and cultural relativeness the experiential subtheory deals with the issue of novelty and automatizing of processing it is related to the notion of learning and the dynamic interplay between controlled and automated processing in the competition for cognitive resources finally there is the componential subtheory which is subdivided into a metacomponents b performance components and c knowledge acquisition components which are directly related to learning
6215100 the learning capabilities of organizational members are at least in part socially constructed by national occupational or other institutions
6215101 pleasant outcomes successes reinforce stimulus response links whereas unpleasant outcomes failures break stimulus response links as a result pleasant outcomes are much more effective at teaching new behaviors
6215102 a key question is how long organizational learning processes take and whether the duration can be externally influenced
6215103 time pressure can both accelerate and slow down learning processes is experienced as motivating or threatening if the sense of threat becomes too excessive however learning can be slowed or made impossible altogether
6215104 education that occurs as a direct participation in the events of life

6215107 the norwegian embassy in moscow was today informed by the russian ministry of defense that russian authorities are considering a freeze on military relations between russia and nato member countries

6215112 lo que hay dentro de la sala toda la gente hecha polvo por los suelos
6215113 que en la mayor a de los casos no han tenido datos durante la tarde y conforme han pasado las horas han aflorado situaciones de estr s y ansiedad
6215114 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6215115 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6215116 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6215117 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6215118 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6215119 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6215120 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6215121 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6215122 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6215123 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6215124 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6215125 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6215126 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6215127 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6215128 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6215129 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6215130 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6215131 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6215132 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6215133 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6215134 even when youve won a big 12 championship the year before or back to back it means nothing now everybodys after the same thing once again and its your job to go try and earn it
6215135 if youre in last place you try to win all your games if youre in first place you try to win all your games you just do the best you can and see what happens
6215136 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6215137 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6215138 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6215139 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6215140 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6215141 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6215142 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6215143 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6215144 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6215145 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6215146 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6215147 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6215148 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6215149 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6215150 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6215151 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6215152 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6215153 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6215154 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6215155 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6215156 who are open to doing something on the production side
6215157 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6215158 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6215159 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6215160 is anathema to chinas communist party which began persecuting the nations faithful even before taking power in 1949

6215238 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6215239 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6215240 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5
6215241 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6215242 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system

6215244 what are you doing in gaza have you been to israel before do you speak russian do you have a driving license how many passports do you have whats your boss called
6215245 israel has refused transit to more sick palestinians seeking treatment since hamas took control of the strip and several of them die unnecessarily every month
6215246 despite the agreement between hamas and israel there has been no improvement towards patients in gaza in israeli policy which seems even to have become worse to the obstacles imposed by the general security service on people who want to leave gaza for medical treatment patients face more bureaucratic difficulties imposed by the army which prevent them enjoying their right to health

6215249 the issue is one of justice not of distributing food parcels and medicines to people in need without a system by which israel is held to account for its actions justice does not exist
6215250 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
6215251 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy

6215261 we tried to play some good football and it went pretty well
6215262 we had our chances against a good german side but technically we made some mistakes which was disappointing
6215263 we made a poor start playing slowly and lacking aggression
6215264 we were superior in the second half when you win 3 0 away its an expression of the confidence we bring with us from the european championship
6215265 we used most of our stamina in the first 45 minutes and ran out of steam we have to admit that
6215266 we got over run in the second half because they simply play so fast
6215267 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
6215268 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the external environment represents an excellent achievement
6215269 it demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
6215270 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
6215271 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance
6215272 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline

6215305 and his company that he worked for a lot of them and all the friends and this little boulder community all of the ranchers got on their horses one day and spent time out there too
6215306 theres lots of people lots and lots of people and probably ones im not even aware of were out there just because people felt driven to go out there

6215337 you are absolutely on point about giving passengers a reason to smile as a number are around me this afternoon
6215338 the purser on this flight just came up to tell me about the happy reactions she has been getting from passengers i get the feeling she doesnt get that too often
6215339 we support most corporate vpns virtual private networks so that passengers can utilize the service in full compliance with their business security requirements in addition we are also working with isps that serve corporations ipass is one that weve announced so that passengers who are required to gain access through that enhanced security service can also use gogo
6215340 we considered a number of different options when we looked at this technology
6215341 the reason we went with aircell is that they offer the most robust option out there the equipment is lightweight equipment so from a fuel perspective were not concerned there
6215342 we think that the satellite based connectivity for us is a more robust experience for our customers
6215343 we believe its more consistent than air to ground we want to test it to see what the customer experience is before we install it on all our aircraft
6215344 the huge issue has been the cost of putting the systems into the planes
6215345 its made it very difficult to have a reasonable expectation to earn money off the system
6215346 i think an awful lot of people will find it attractive twelve dollars for a five hour flight is nothing if it provides sufficiently fast service for people who like to surf the web and arent driven crazy by slow speeds the business traveler doesnt surf the web they want to send and receive e mails its pretty straightforward and you dont need tremendous connectivity to do that
6215347 as we do with other content we provide onboard we trust that our customers will use good judgment and that will prevail
6215348 our flight attendants are pretty well trained to deal with and handle situations where someone is displaying inappropriate content
6215349 no one gives a shit about the child get it done
6215350 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6215351 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6215352 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6215353 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6215354 if you dont meet those basic criteria you are not going to achieve success
6215355 theyve got to go in and see thats why i cant tell you id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what time is on it
6215356 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just it is an honour for france and its army to defend it
6215357 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6215358 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6215359 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6215360 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 percent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction
6215361 buy them some time and allow them to emerge from the crisis and rebuild
6215362 there is simply too much lending capacity in the global economy
6215363 la vida es s lo un vistazo moment neo de las maravillas de este asombroso universo y es triste que tantos la est n malgastando so ando con fantas as espirituales

6215367 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6215368 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6215369 one of reasons we created babyfirsttv is that we thought there was no good programming for babies on tv and according to the research that is out there most of the babies are watching tv anyway
6215370 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6215371 i wouldnt be surprised to see him in a mccain administration
6215372 how can i get re elected to my cushy job
6215373 no the greatest hindrance to christianity today is christians do not know how to practice the presence of god
6215374 this is that which unlocks the treasury of heaven many keys fit many locks but the master key is the blood and the name of him that died and rose again and even lives in heaven to save the uttermost
6215375 we cant deny god created but after that he just stepped back and now watches everything like spectator viewing a great cosmic motion picture
6215376 thomas disco tom john mitchell ashley born 11 february 1984 in auckland is a sailor from new zealand who won the gold medal at the 2008 rs x world championships he is the 2008 world champion
6215377 aside from his on water achievements thomass performances at international windsurfing event after parties have earned him the nickname disco tom if anything the relative infrequency of these parties has added to the myth of his electrifying dance floor routines this myth in turn has buttressed his reputation as the most desired man in international windsurfing
6215378 someone drew my attention to it at the worlds and i know exactly who is responsible its my best mate from australia i didnt think it was a big enough deal to get it deleted its a bit tongue and cheek
6215379 im not really into that kind of thing i dont really like big occasions and big crowds so ill be more than happy not to go
6215380 the conditions in valencia are very similar to what we expect in china with lighter breezes and i want to make sure the training is as specific as possible
6215381 and theres also a very good infrastructure here with the kiwi sailors involved in the americas cup
6215382 ive been training most of the time for the past two years in light winds its been a big focus to get strong and competitive in these conditions but you still need to be able sail in all conditions and i think that will be my strength
6215383 im quite happy to sail the whole regatta in light wind if need be but if we do get one or more days of breeze other guys who might be at my level in light winds might suffer in the breeze
6215384 its impossible to say how it will go but if things go the way we expect im pretty happy with the way things have been going
6215385 the cyclings for aerobic fitness which is crucial and theres a leg strength component in windsurfing as well so a lot of the work i do in the gym is also leg based
6215386 the pumping is a whole body movement so its important it starts with the legs the arms are actually last in line and therefore the least important
6215387 its never ideal to travel with windsurfers so people often get rid of boards rather than travelling with them
6215388 there was a group of european sailors training in auckland before the sydney olympics and they were all selling their boards before they went overseas so my mum and dad got me a board for my birthday and thats what got me into it
6215389 its not actually that uncommon theres nothing of a cult about it or anything
6215390 its not scientific in western terms but they consider it a science and it has been around a couple of thousand years the benefits are quite well documented and i find it works
6215391 it makes sense to me and theres nothing too crazy i eat food id normally eat anyway although there are a couple of things i stay away from for me the main thing is on food preparation allegedly for my constitution i should cook food before i eat it i shouldnt eat raw food
6215392 i do ok with spanish but with the cops sometimes it isnt even worth trying you just make it worse

6215418 john mccain has provided honorable service to our country but when it comes to his economic policies he is promising and proposing the same things weve been doing for the last eight years
6215419 weve got to partner with our governors to come up with these plans the way that mark warner did such a wonderful job when he was governor and the way that tim kaine is currently doing such a great job as governor of virginia

6215421 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6215422 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt seem to understand the consequences of an american defeat in iraq how it would risk a wider war and threaten the security of american families
6215423 i am going to end this war but when i bring our troops home they will come home with honor and victory leaving iraq secured as a democratic ally in the arab heartland

6215428 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6215429 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6215430 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6215431 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6215432 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6215433 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6215434 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6215435 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6215436 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6215437 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6215438 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6215439 the prosecution will have to call all the witnesses to testify before this matter is decided

6215454 the united states is not a monetary system it is a credit system under the president and the u s congress

6215456 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6215457 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6215458 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6215459 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6215460 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6215461 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence

6215557 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6215558 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6215559 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6215560 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6215561 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6215581 every time your ad could potentially show quality score matters
6215582 with the onset of quality score the bar has been raised and relevancy has become much more scientific if you want to approach it correctly

6215584 video is the next big thing on the web and more and more organizations are embracing it as the way to provide an equal experience for web surfers who dont necessarily have the time to watch television during the day but for all the video services and there are many hulu easily stands above the rest and provides us with the best programming and experience call me a cynic but watching the junk on youtube or the ridiculous garbage on funny or die just doesnt do it for me instead i prefer to enjoy professional programming in a way that has never been allowed before but the beauty of hulu goes far beyond programming hulu is real proof that the entertainment industry is slowly coming around to the idea of embracing the web and not being afraid of it and proves a point ive been making all along most people are honest and are more than willing to do the right thing to enjoy their favorite shows hulu is the first example of how to overcome the debilitating crossroads that were now standing in and has shown with each passing day that where theres great programming and a free service people will flock

6215628 sacrifice patience understanding and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come lets face it lets talk sense to the american people lets tell them the truth
6215629 what does concern me is not just winning this election but how it is won how well we can take advantage of this great quadrennial opportunity to debate issues sensibly and soberly
6215630 they are much alike in the way they look at issues they are not ideologues they have the habit of looking at all sides
6215631 what you cant do anymore is just roll your eyes and say oh thats just joe lieberman knows what hes doing and there are consequences

6215637 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6215638 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6215639 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6215640 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6215641 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6215642 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6215643 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6215644 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly

6215648 theres a part of all of us that wants to be boardwalk

6215653 theres a part of all of us that wants to be boardwalk
6215654 but if you want to win monopoly you buy the affordable places and you build hotels thats what going to happen with toronto
6215655 congratulations to montreal but when we play were still going to win

6215657 i love the new board i love the fact canadas on there three times
6215658 reports indicate that the taliban are covertly building their strength
6215659 it surprises me and its going to be disturbing for some folks
6215660 the canadian public has been so conditioned to see this war as improvised explosive devices and mines but were going to have to acknowledge that theyve stepped up a rung on the ladder and are capable of mounting conventional attacks again
6215661 in taliban leadership have created vacuums that will take time to fill
6215662 if the status quo of aboriginal economic and educational initiatives continues street gangs and violent activity will increase and already marginalized aboriginal populations will experience a diminishing quality of life
6215663 the fallout from aboriginal poverty is all too obvious and will only get worse
6215664 their spread from urban centres to reserves is not a sign of organizational growth but rather the continuing unhealthy social state of these communities
6215665 the rcmp has engaged in past initiatives directed at aboriginal people and we should play yet still a greater role if we want to make a difference in their communities as well as strengthen our understaffed ranks
6215666 such an initiative would be akin to the marshall plan that rebuilt europe in the 1950s
6215667 at the same time if these aboriginal candidates decided not to join the rcmp but go on to other careers this would still benefit their communities
6215668 its a partnership that has to develop with the communities
6215669 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today
6215670 we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6215671 whether they paid too high a price to get into this project remains to be seen
6215672 the coffee is cold and the donuts are stale by the time information gets down to the end of the table
6215673 this is a significant piece of work that could create millions of person hours of employment
6215674 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6215675 chevrons participation in the hebron project gives our company a strategic platform for growth on the east coast of canada where we are exploring for impact sized resources in the orphan basin and have a major financial interest in the hibernia offshore oil project
6215676 regarding this issue several powerful countries rich countries have assisted in funding the khmer rouge tribunal already
6215677 if there will be a trial justice is for all victims
6215678 our taxpayer money is not going to good use for these automatic weapons
6215679 there is a trend around the country of police departments getting more and more sophisticated weapons
6215680 the reason is that we have the same trend with our criminals who are arming themselves with these weapons
6215681 after 9 11 police departments became much more militarized in terms of response
6215682 tactical units were no longer just looked upon as a response to a situation with a couple of hostages but more of a counterterrorism unit there is this feeling that we now live in an era of counterterrorism and the feeling is that you need to be prepared
6215683 plus there are situations in the schools that have happened across the country we practice active shooter scenarios these days and these weapons are the best ones to handle these types of situations
6215684 paterson passaic and clifton should be armed to the teeth because there are a whole lot more weapons found in those areas
6215685 up here we need to have them in case we have a situation like in the north hollywood robbery i dont think in an area like this it would be feasible to have every officer have weapons like this in the trunk of their vehicle
6215686 were very fortunate that weve come to some very peaceful conclusions to most of the jobs over the years in bergen county
6215687 if you have to wait for somebody to go to paramus to pick up a ump it absolutely defeats the purpose
6215688 its not like a firetruck or a street sweeper you can schedule its a piece of equipment that has to be readily available to an officer at a moments notice
6215689 i wouldnt care if they had tanks if they needed them
6215690 im for having everything at your disposal as long as its used cautiously and in a measured way
6215691 i think the police have the right to protect themselves the best they can
6215692 but its not like the movies this is north arlington i could see it in new york city but its relatively quiet here
6215693 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
6215694 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
6215695 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
6215696 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
6215697 its highly unlikely any of those choices are going to decisively impact the election
6215698 it could make a difference at the margins but the choice is much more about governing
6215699 im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
6215700 sem falar de nomes vicente de moura sugere n s prepar mos os atletas desportivamente mas culturalmente n o porque a educa o n o connosco
6215701 the demand for tickets this morning was just immense all the ticket sites slowed down severely but nothing crashed and the system worked very smoothly we want to thank the fans for their patience and look forward to seeing you all at the shows
6215702 to the extent that the economy gets worse that will help sen
6215703 people are overwhelmingly saying that the economy is what matters this election
6215704 the one big question mark is what happens in next few months on the economy
6215705 if banks fail if the housing crisis gets worse its conventional wisdom that that would be helpful to obama republicans will be blamed for any disruption in the economy rightfully or wrongfully
6215706 you look at poll numbers and mccain is hanging tough under very difficult economic circumstances
6215707 the trend is set now people understand the economy has been weak under bush at least in his second term so that certainly hurts sen mccain as the republican nominee and gives sen obama a significant edge because he can argue that we cant continue this path
6215708 i think gas prices will trend down to election day and beyond and that will be a positive in the psychology of voters but its not going to outweigh the negatives of the job market
6215709 i dont think the average person feels the worst is over by any stretch of the imagination
6215710 anything you do do comprehensively nothing happens in a vacuum
6215711 we get what we ask for its all about the rules
6215712 pushed the bartender against the wall pulled his hair and smashed at least nine liquor bottles
6215713 the secretary general extends his condolences to the people of algeria and in particular to the families of the victims
6215714 this is the only reality there is if you can get it down on paper in words notes or color so much the better
6215715 yang penting gua udah dapet kerjaan dan dapet kedudukan di kantor masalah prestasi dan lainnya emang gua pikirin toh indonesia kaya sumberdaya alam ini nggak akan habis tujuh turunan
6215716 hizbullah appreciates sheikh hassan courage and is aware of the special circumstances that forced him to decide to freeze the memorandum of understanding
6215717 we respect this decision and assure the salafist groups which signed the memorandum of understanding that hizbullah will support whatever decision they find appropriate
6215718 when we visited former minister samir al jisr future mp one day ahead of signing the memorandum we understood that our brothers in the future movement were not against such step had we realized they were against it we would not have done it
6215719 the second reason is related to the fact that most of the sunni community turned out to be dissatisfied with our move unlike the case with our fellow shiites
6215720 should speak to the real representatives of the sunni community
6215721 confronting sedition can only be achieved through entering homes from their gates
6215722 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hizbullah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hizbullah
6215723 during the second leban ese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hizbullah attacks
6215724 at that time we had hizbullah in our sights and not the lebanese state but the hizbullah fighters do not live on the moon and some civilian infrastructure was hit
6215725 the moment hizbullah takes control of the lebanese government we will have to address the consequences
6215726 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
6215727 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organization and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hizbullah state we will not be so restrained
6215728 mambre calls on its viewers to contribute to putting an end to armed conflicts that only produce chaos and exert efforts to maintain peace and help local societies which have sought for better circumstances
6215729 four civilians have been killed in our neighborhood two of them were killed by an rpg rocket propelled grenade shell that struck their house and the other two were caught in the cross fire
6215730 seven people were also hurt and one victim bled to death because there was no chance of getting him to hospital
6215731 those who are against peace attacked our contingent in k4 area and we defended ourselves
6215732 they used mortars and other heavy arms but we suffered no casualties on our side
6215733 the president knows all laf officers and what would be in the armys best interests
6215734 earlier dialogue sessions dealt with most of the disputed issues back then we were left with two issues electing a new president and agreeing on a defense strategy
6215735 we already elected a president and the defense strategy is all that is left when we start discussing the defense strategy we will definitely touch on other related issues
6215736 among the proposals is drafting a new electoral law for the next parliamentary elections this proposal was made by mp amin sherri hizbullah
6215737 officers were only brought up on loyalty to the nation as a whole we will not accept unjustified intervention in the internal affairs of the military establishment
6215738 the military should be kept away from all forms of political disputes listing the names of candidates for the post of army commander according to alleged political allegiances is a direct offense against the army and its next commander
6215739 both states should be aware of the dangers that threaten their stability and should therefore work together to achieve their common goals
6215740 it is the right of any faction to demand a constitutional amendment to provide the deputy premier with powers but this can only be achieved through a constitutional mechanism
6215741 it is clear to everyone that this campaign aims at taking the country to another sectarian clash we care to emphasize that we would never get involved in such a clash
6215742 the parties who are proposing giving the deputy premier more privileges want to arrive at having two prime ministers for the same cabinet
6215743 the ministry had previously cut the rates on the fixed telephone lines and we intend to reduce these rates even further
6215744 we hope to overcome all the problems and name the members at libantelecom if the government manages to name the commander of the lebanese army soon then it will not be impossible to name the members at libantelecom
6215745 until privatization is done we will give libantelecom every chance to compete with other cellular companies by granting a third license to a third cellular firm
6215746 lebanese students should make the best out of the 2008 2009 academic year which will hopefully not be interrupted by any security incidents
6215747 your expertise and input are highly valuable to us and will contribute in reforming the education sector which is one of the most vital sectors
6215748 reforms should culminate sooner or later so that we can move from being a developing country into being a productive and developed one
6215749 because schools and universities should be open to the society they live in
6215750 it is important that we all realize that strengthening the lebanese will reflect on the overall situation in lebanon
6215751 stability and security in lebanon starts in schools and universities
6215752 its unacceptable that christian and muslim students know nothing about each other
6215753 to follow up on matters discussed during this meeting and engage in further discussions about the education sector
6215754 we will see after 72 hours and try to resolve this issue as we are committed to the judges restoration
6215755 as far as our principled stand is concerned we are not going to compromise
6215756 these should now be taken so that the past can be put behind us and a new beginning made
6215757 the progress of iraq including security and the successful policies achieved by the iraqi government for national unity
6215758 we welcome all lebanese and investors in a safe environment and we will provide lebanon with iraqi oil according to our agreements
6215759 we also agreed on forming a joint iraqi lebanese group which will put the final touches on the joint cooperation and reforming the failure that has occurred between arab countries
6215760 the message that i want to send and work out is that arab countries have passed through many experiences and difficulties for a long time and now we should take the lessons from them
6215761 we should move beyond the troubles that happened due to the roles played by the occupiers and some parties or people and israel which played a role in the troubles we have faced
6215762 i felt from prime minister maliki that there is real readiness to give lebanon special treatment in oil prices and also study all the details about how lebanon could collaborate with iraq in the field of oil
6215763 the new minimum wage can hardly improve the livelihoods of limited income families
6215764 when comparing the cpi at end july 2008 to that at end july 2007 a sharp yearly ascent of 13 94 percent is reported
6215765 im a consumer advocate this is the kind of stuff i love
6215766 women did not create the glass ceiling the invisible barrier blamed for limiting their ability to earn what theyre worth but they help maintain it
6215767 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
6215768 they believe hard work alone is sufficient to put them on salary and status par with their male counterparts
6215769 good work is important but good work alone does not as the myth says speak for itself you have to give it a voice
6215770 this led many women in the study to actually prefer male managers to female managers claiming men are more consistent and fair minded than women
6215771 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
6215772 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
6215773 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
6215774 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
6215775 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
6215776 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
6215777 sex work is not a term that is in my dictionary
6215778 to promote the health safety civil and human rights of sex workers including their rights to live free from violence intimidation coercion or exploitation to engage in the work as safely as possible and to receive high quality health and other services in conditions of trust and confidentiality without discrimination on the grounds of gender sexual orientation disability race culture or religion
6215779 after 10 years of development since its initiation the department believes that it has realized some very solid and competitive programs that could greatly benefit from an external unbiased impartial and professional assessment with this understanding it volunteered to take part in the undp projects engineering review cycle
6215780 positive surprise by the outstanding quality of the study program the excellent equipment and the motivated academic staff at bu our discussions with the students have shown me that they have very good technical knowledge excellent communication and presentation skills and also a good spirit to drive things i would immediately hire balamand graduates for my company robert bosch ltd
6215781 very detailed and profound analysis of the study program of mechanical engineering followed by concrete recommendations which will lead to further improvement in addition to providing balamand university with excellent evidence that their study program is in line with international benchmarks
6215782 the university has two fundamental strengths the willpower and enough resources human and material
6215783 balamand university and the mechanical engineering department in particular are young and very keen to listen to objective external points of view on how they are performing and how to improve whatever needs to be improved
6215784 which will not only have an impact on the advancement of mechanical engineering at the university of balamand but possibly on other engineering programs offered at the university
6215785 we can buy back shares for cancellation we can raise the dividend we can acquire another company we can invest new capital to expand the business or we can park the money in t bills indefinitely
6215786 except that the stock price is pretty high right now and if we announced a buyback it would go even higher so i dont know if that works for us
6215787 i would love to buy back shares but id prefer to see the stock twenty percent lower
6215788 so the trick would be to make the stock go down at least temporarily so you could buy it back on the cheap
6215789 and how would you do that without violating any securities regulations that is
6215790 there is a way if you want to hear it
6215791 it might arouse suspicion however i will take you to dinner
6215792 south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6215793 we are beginning to see the early signs of some withdrawal it is not significant and it needs to increase
6215794 both the size and pace of the withdrawal need to increase and need to increase sooner rather than later
6215795 i dont think they need any more additional time or continue to set additional dates in the future whether its two or three days or whatever it is they just need to withdraw
6215796 turkey has approved three ships for transit into the black sea to transport human relief supplies to georgia that will consist of two us navy ships and a us coast guard cutter
6215797 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernized in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6215798 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favor and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6215799 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6215800 security services are ruling out sabotage or any criminal act
6215801 the problem is that the building is built of wood and this helped the fire to spread everyone is working to bring the situation under control
6215802 ive been called personally 17 times and asked how and when i would like to die
6215803 they also called my family in the west bank and threatened to kill them so theres lots of pressure its moral and psychological terrorism
6215804 we will try to leave tomorrow night if everything falls into place thats the intention
6215805 people have threatened to blow the boats up we are worried but thats not going to stop anybody i think we will succeed
6215806 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6215807 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your heads to be professional
6215808 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6215809 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6215810 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6215811 its a botched way to try to gain some influential political ground in the north
6215812 it was a very good beginning for some sort of defusing the sectarian problems
6215813 its one of the attempts to do too little too late none of that is really working
6215814 a deal like this will help calm sectarian strife but this is not the primary motivation
6215815 gather and bring into the fold some of those sunnis who are already against the future movement
6215816 hizbullah is not thinking about the south about baabda and aley its thinking about all lebanon its trying to work in tripoli as well as in kesrouan
6215817 you cannot sell it after what hizbullah has done in beirut
6215818 as a sunni what did you get hizbullah is trying to institutionalize its victory but it will not give up anything it has gained
6215819 there are some rifts and divisions within the salafist group
6215820 dont lump all of the salafists together if you listen to what shahhal is saying he believes in the constitution in the institutions etc
6215821 when you go to akkar and tripoli the people are 90 percent with the future movement hizbullah cannot bypass the future movement it wasnt good
6215822 the future movement has countered by playing with the salafist movement and their contradictions
6215823 theyre definitely not united its not the salafi agenda that unites them
6215824 has ideological and religious connotations that go beyond the lebanese context
6215825 future might have a salafi or two on their ticket
6215826 by an indirect calculation he is a friend of the salafists
6215827 his memorandum of understanding remains the thing he is most proud to show off
6215828 its an unequal memorandum of understanding it looks like a lebanese syrian kind of accord
6215829 the terrorists should know the only way for them is to give themselves up
6215830 as the president has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6215831 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the country
6215832 the chinese government condemns this terrorist action and we express deep condolences to the deceased
6215833 we firmly oppose terrorism in all forms and we support the algerian governments efforts in combating terrorism and safeguarding national stability
6215834 the number of executions has generally increased since a while ago and iran carries out the highest number of executions for offences committed as minors
6215835 child rights advocates are very concerned about the current situation and our protests have got nowhere
6215836 i wanted the execution of my sons murderer from the beginning and never said i wanted blood money
6215837 we can breathe much better these restrictions show the difference the cars make
6215838 it will get worse once they are back on the road but it could still be better than it was because of the environmental measures taken regarding the factories
6215839 my feeling is that if they can just keep the current measures thats ok for our lives they work
6215840 pollution control measures are already pretty good i mean the traffic and air pollution restrictions now beijing has a lot of parks and the level of investment is high
6215841 in the past 20 years ive watched things go from very regional and very local where race registration took place out of the back of a truck and where racing scenes from new england the northwest colorado and california only go to bang heads with each other at nationals to one where the best riders get to race on the best courses every weekend
6215842 the biggest thing ive been working on these past few years is to bring all those regional organizers together in a national association of uci organizers to create a calendar where pros can make a living and regional riders have well organized events to compete in
6215843 people get carbon crazy so we do get a lot of requests for carbon cross frames
6215844 but the problem with carbon frames is that while they are quite strong when ridden
6215845 to second guess the mind set of a young man in the heat of battle four years later and to put the question in a civilian court system that cant even remotely comprehend the battlefield is shameful for this government
6215846 while not acknowledging that any part of the governments case is true the fact is the military sent these people out to do a job and kill everything that moved in a city where there were no good guys left
6215847 the killings were unlawful because they violated clearly established law of war
6215848 all marines including the defendant were repeatedly taught that they shall do no harm to detainees
6215849 my classmates came from syria turkey cyprus and afghanistan among other places i studied with ahsraf ghani who went on to serve as afghanistans finance minister this made student concerns more international while nowadays the student body is mainly lebanese and concerns are much more focused on local politics and issues
6215850 tariq al jadideh is a sunni stronghold and as a shiite i felt out of place during the summer 2006 war
6215851 i also felt that the thinking there was very conservative and was conscious of how i dressed so i moved to hamra where all sects blend in and the thinking is much more open
6215852 people these days dont seem to have their own views and instead act upon the directions of a certain politician or party
6215853 a lot of lebanese students are raised abroad and are more familiar with the streets of paris than of lebanon so they have multiple identities and concerns
6215854 i see people more than students demonstrating especially when prices of goods go up students instead get into fights when it comes to politics
6215855 to be elected as a student you have to belong to a sect
6215856 and this has caused fights during the last three years of elections instead of focusing on how to improve university life students are concerned with the parties to which each person belongs
6215857 while working as a part time literary critic he is also a cashier at the aub hospital and through this he is able to get free health insurance and send his children to study at aub for free that is the reality of intellectuals today life has become too expensive to be a full time intellectual
6215858 most intellectuals are leftist thinkers and they want to take a political stand
6215859 so without realizing some are indirectly affiliating themselves with a sect or political party perhaps they should have stepped away from taking a political stand
6215860 he is a 37 year old lawyer and human rights activist and is pushing for electoral reform
6215861 but when people enter politics they do disappoint me in the end
6215862 and there are similar movements elsewhere in the world a small country like lebanon should be united
6215863 aub wants to make sure most of its beneficiaries are local for example it is a scandal that the cafeteria is run by an international company rather than a local catering company
6215864 this project is about being a better neighbor and sharing more of what the aub has to offer
6215865 if this doesnt happen the neighborhood will be overtaken by luxury high rise buildings the area will become gentrified
6215866 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6215867 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean windfarm

6215873 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to
6215874 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6215875 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6215876 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6215877 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world

6215879 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6215880 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6215881 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6215882 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6215883 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6215884 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilization to topple the regime in sudan
6215885 its own judicial institutions and is capable of trying anyone who violates justice
6215886 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end
6215887 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody

6215907 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
6215908 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
6215909 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6215910 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard

6215919 the market says mister johnson is like a beautiful woman endlessly fascinating endlessly complex always changing always mystifying
6215920 i have been absorbed and immersed since 1924 and i know this is no science it is an art now we have computers and all sorts of statistics but the market is still the same and understanding the market is still no easier it is a personal intuition sensing patterns of behaviour there is always something unknown undiscerned
6215921 personal intuition does not mean that you can translate last nights exotic dream into some brilliant choice in the market professional money managers often seem to make up their minds in a split second but what pushes them over the line of decision is usually an incremental bit of information which added to all the slumbering pieces of information filed in their minds suddenly makes the picture whole
6215922 its a kind of locked in concentration an intuition a feel nothing that can be schooled the first thing you have to know is yourself
6215923 if you are going to operate with intuition or judgement then it follows that the first thing you have to know is yourself you are face it a bunch of emotions prejudices and twitches and this is all very well as long as you know it successful speculators do not necessarily have a complete portrait of themselves warts and all in their own minds but they do have the ability to stop abruptly when their own intuition and what is happening out there are suddenly out of kilter

6215996 evidence in its broadest sense includes anything that is used to determine or demonstrate the truth of an assertion philosophically evidence can include propositions which are presumed to be true used in support of other propositions that are presumed to be falsifiable the term has specialized meanings when used with respect to specific fields such as policy scientific method criminal procedures and legal discourse the most immediate form of evidence available to an individual is the observations of that persons own senses for example an observer wishing for evidence that the sky is blue need only look at the sky however this same example illustrates some of the difficulties of evidence as well someone who was blue yellow color blind but did not know it would have a very different perception of what color the sky was than someone who was not even simple sensory perceptions qualia ultimately are subjective guaranteeing that the same information can be considered somehow true in an objective sense is the main challenge of establishing standards of evidence there is also the question of what is meant by blue and how we measure it if determined by a particular wave length of colour then how do we actually measure this there is also the question of how evidence translates e g is blau in german universally translated as blue in english germans may have different words for different parts of the spectrum thus evidence is a social construction

6216125 the only thing ukraines army is basically able to do is march down kyivs main street khreshchatyk for a military parade thats it
6216126 what happened in georgia is the best example how easily military actions and questions of territorial integrity can in todays condition be forced upon a country that does not have collective security guarantees
6216127 then that means we are on verge of deep and serious military actions
6216128 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6216129 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6216130 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance

6216137 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6216138 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6216139 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia

6216153 throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it of everybody in the world
6216154 expand the current missions that you are doing that you are carrying out here in america and throughout the world
6216155 that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends and it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
6216156 strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others
6216157 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
6216158 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
6216159 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6216160 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable

6216186 we are fortunate enough to have a loyal and loving clientele who have evolved with us over the years and allowed us to do what we love this award is accepted by us on behalf of the many staff members who have loved the matterhorn as much as we do and have left their mark on the rich and complex culture that it represents today
6216187 i just think its really easy right now to put up a blog and try to take your review and elevate that review out of its very noble purpose in either defending the new or protecting a consumer or advising a consumer and taking it to be its own creation equal to that of what you are critiquing
6216188 i think thats perfectly fair to share your opinions with a work of art

6216208 41 of respondents said neither mccain nor obama is running a negative campaign
6216209 5 11 racist comments are not appropriate for a country that pretends to be the leader of the free world
6216210 nearly one third of voters see mccains campaign as negative while just 5 say the same of obama
6216211 under most scenarios extending the catch up to 26 wasnt cost effective
6216212 with so many essential questions still unanswered there is good reason to be cautious about introducing large scale vaccination programs

6216220 the full implications of this primate study await publication of the research in a scientific journal

6216227 we want our viewers to connect with the homeowners getting a makeover
6216228 i think they definitely geared it to what they heard the homeowners saying and each took something different out of it
6216229 they both incorporated elements from each side but one went a little bit more one way or the other
6216230 it was like a dream come true a once in a lifetime kind of thing

6216249 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6216250 we were playing and listening to a lot of grateful dead
6216251 then we started listening to the music that influenced them we ended up playing straight up bluegrass and thought that we would only attract hillbillies and old people but we have co headlined at heavy metal festivals and no one got up to leave
6216252 we are always working to stay ahead of the curve and redefine the next trend
6216253 in this time of rising gas prices and economic recession while other theaters are considering raising their prices we want to position ourselves as one of the only professional theater companies offering lower ticket prices
6216254 my boys had four suitcases full of patches and started trading them off
6216255 they could take five patches to a jamboree and come back with 100
6216256 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6216257 it is getting critical to where time now becomes more of an issue for just the physical part of getting ready for the opener
6216258 every day we miss now does start to factor in as to what the workload will be from the start
6216259 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6216260 we hear this time homicidal riggs mel gibson is about to retire but pulls murtaugh danny glover out of retirement to solve one final case before they both officially head off into the sun gibson and glover are down to return although no deals have been signed yet with the attractive package and a solid script the picture will go soon
6216261 once cruise dropped out and jolie expressed interest columbia decided to rewrite the part for her and reportedly
6216262 mitch is furious hes certain someone put e in amys drink and hes determined to get to the bottom of it he is convinced that one of her hangers on was responsible and hes waiting for a toxicology report to show what caused her to fit
6216263 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
6216264 army official who revealed deplorable conditions at veterans treatment facility is forced to resign
6216265 im only going to tell you this because youre part of the family i got laid off
6216266 of course i fucking know what happened thats why i dont think you should be sitting here on the couch doing nothing you should be at work working
6216267 dont get an attitude with me i can be home because i have vacation time
6216268 so i just tossed my pad in there without wrapp
6216269 immature look at you sulking around instead of helping around the house shes thirteen she should be mature enough to handle cleaning up after herself
6216270 you know this is only the second time shes had her period
6216271 that doesnt mean she needs to be immature about it and leave blood all over the place and a couple of open pads
6216272 yeah because vanessa doesnt know how to clean up after herself
6216273 you dont know how hard it is to have your period for the second time
6216274 still she doesnt need to make a mess and not clean
6216275 i will talk with her if i have to even though its a little odd that i would have to do that

6216277 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6216278 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 into it
6216279 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6216280 i know that i will only ever have enough time to do 10 of the cool ideas i really want to do so i share the other 90 with everyone hoping someone else can do them
6216281 the goal was to create the greatest trailer for a movie that does not exist
6216282 this is going to sound ridiculous but the goal was to change how books are sold you look at movies and all the time and energy they put into advertising and while some books have trailers all they are is the scary mans voice reading the back of the dust jacket theres no thought about character or plot or investing the reader
6216283 but we filmed a little extra and some overlaps and we even had a half dozen actors we casted who read the same parts just in case the actors were better than the writers but the writers were the best actors and i felt bad for most of the actors who ended up on the cutting room floor
6216284 it took a while to shoot because of everyones scheduling
6216285 this has been in the works for six months but once we had it ready everyone was shot within a ten day period and luckily i didnt have to be there for it thats the best part about being a writer and not a director
6216286 do i look that crazy ill say this the great story that which is mentioned in the book some people say the weapon was a rock or a stone some say cain bit abels throat but this is not a vampire tale

6216301 we still play dance music videos that are not aired on any other television outlet however weve seen more and more evidence that there is a real void and interest in programming that spotlights different dance forms and genres as well as the cultures that originate and enjoy them

6216313 i have nothing substantive to confirm or deny this particular suggestion
6216314 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6216315 would probably defer in the first instance to the french authorities
6216316 is it not time to remove from the qualification of an orangeman those references to our roman catholic fellow subjects of both northern ireland and the irish republic
6216317 the one thing i will say is that i am supportive of continually reviewing the rules including that particular one i have no difficulty with that
6216318 especially for funerals clearly that is one rule which could be looked at but i wouldnt like to make any judgement on it until i see any proposals coming forward officially
6216319 but yes certainly i would be open to look at suggestions and i would be quite happy to see this issue being considered particularly with regards to funerals
6216320 the special place of the roman catholic church in the constitution has gone is it not time to remove from the qualification of an orangeman those references to our roman catholic fellow subjects of both northern ireland and the irish republic
6216321 references which they find offensive and many of us anachronistic what better way to change without compromise than to return to the original qualifications
6216322 in doing so we would be displaying to the world that we still hold dear our protestant principles more than that we would be practising the instructions of scripture on which our order is founded

6216360 there is only one way to go up after last week
6216361 its converting third downs and making good decisions personally and eliminating the mental mistakes were looking forward to doing that and hopefully putting some points on the board and just having a good taste in our mouth as we go into the regular season
6216362 we havent played that poorly in a long time so there is a sense of trying to get things righted and get our confidence back up
6216363 you can say you are a confident team and those things but when your productivity is 45 yards in the first half and four sacks that gets tested we definitely have something to prove this weekend
6216364 i think we were 0 5 on third and one to five which you cant do youve got to convert those third downs and keep the chains moving
6216365 you want to get into the shape where you are feeling you are coming out of the halftime locker room and you know how the reaction comes after making some halftime adjustments
6216366 for the most part the most important thing is to be healthy and fresh going into that first week i think that is why most teams handle it that way
6216367 i think one of the biggest guys to directly benefit is donald driver
6216368 with greg not in there a lot of times teams are going to double donald donald is such a big part of our offense with greg back it probably takes a little pressure off because youve kind of got to pick your poison if you double donald were going to go after greg if you double greg well go with donald

6216372 one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country

6216375 california has very high housing costs in several areas and many teachers especially younger ones are priced out of their school districts housing market
6216376 with support from their local community they can live closer to their campus and spend more time with students rather than spending it stuck in traffic this bill will help some of our best and brightest stay in this noble profession
6216377 the lack of affordable housing results in teachers needing to seek employment elsewhere thereby reducing the number of highly qualified teachers in our district
6216378 the income would help us offset maintenance costs district wide which would enable us to focus more of our existing resources on teaching and learning
6216379 this misguided policy will increase ticket prices for consumers and hurt struggling small market airports while doing nothing to relieve or mitigate delays
6216380 failed to fix inadequate monitoring requirements and prohibited states and local authorities from doing so
6216381 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
6216382 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
6216383 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
6216384 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
6216385 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river

6216399 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
6216400 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country

6216402 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines

6216405 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
6216406 its easy to ignore 3 or 5 percent votes but its pretty hard to ignore 22 percent votes or 39 percent votes
6216407 that proposal was rejected by stockholders however the company elected to prepare a report simply because it had been a timely issue
6216408 the chairman thought it was the right thing to do at the time
6216409 it just doesnt seem to us that there is a whole lot of value to shareholders to do a study to tell them what they already know
6216410 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
6216411 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
6216412 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
6216413 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet

6216424 the worst is yet to come in the u s
6216425 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6216426 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds
6216427 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
6216428 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
6216429 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
6216430 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
6216431 we need to create a resolution process that ensures the financial system can withstand the failure of a large complex financial firm

6216436 the offenses they come out of in college they have certain things that are important
6216437 when you get to this level the run game the pass game pass protection theyre all equally important you cant segment
6216438 you cant put one thing on the top shelf and something else on the bottom shelf everything has to be on the same shelf here its a lot of volume it takes a little bit of time but its fun when that light bulb clicks
6216439 at first it was like i was lost out there and i couldnt control it because i didnt know the playbook or the speed of the game yet
6216440 but everythings coming at first i was only thinking but now im playing football
6216441 when youre coming into the league for the first time its a big adjustment because of the volume and the way we teach techniques
6216442 we try to get things to look the way we want it to look to be consistent for the quarterback to be consistent for the running back in the run game its been a little bit of a process
6216443 you dont have any choice but to get the blocking down if you go against kamp
6216444 its the pass protection thats the toughest youve got 270 pounds coming toward you and you have to hold up i have to work a little bit harder on that and im going to do that before the regular season comes
6216445 weve got linebackers that are as fast as the receivers and if they get their hands on you it destroys your route
6216446 the first five yards at tight end is crucial you have to hit them and get out thats one thing ive learned in this league
6216447 i got little short ones but i havent gotten deep ones yet if i get that opportunity im going to take advantage of it for sure
6216448 if i get the ball in my hands i can show them what i can do

6216456 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6216457 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard
6216458 switzerland is in favour of india developing its civilian nuclear energy switzerland depends on nuclear power for 30 of its energy needs increasingly there is a realisation that the world has to depend on nuclear energy if they have to solve the problem of global warming europe is also realising it
6216459 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
6216460 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru

6216468 the war bloc of course seems more interested in tough guy theatre leaders who make a good show of strength whether or not theyre concretely addressing the problems at hand ariel sharon vladimir putin and george bush all owe their political strength to the adroit manipulation of terrorist attacks to their own benefit and none of them show much interest in taking many of the serious steps needed to actually address the problems their countries have

6216482 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6216483 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6216484 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6216485 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6216486 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6216487 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed

6216574 one of the reasons to move downtown was because of the visibility it could offer our company
6216575 the sign appears to be too large graphically so its placed at a very clumsy location on the building
6216576 the building was designed to put signs on the lower level to comply with signage standards
6216577 a completely closed definition of sustainability that everyone can agree on isnt necessary to make progress
6216578 where you end up isnt so much about the definition
6216579 part of the opportunity here is to move beyond any given set of even these core issues of carbon emissions and recycling rates to build a broader coalition that understands sustainability as a way of living and governing
6216580 in a perverse and provocative way we will benefit by these changes beyond our control
6216581 the question under our control is how much are we going to benefit and how equitably distributed will these benefits be
6216582 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6216583 buyers increasingly want the convenience of shopping for great value often new items at a fixed price this is fuelling a big growth in the number of large and small sellers using ebay in this way
6216584 todays improvements will remove barriers for sellers so they can make the most of this opportunity and offer even more goods for sale on ebay

6216593 these last four years were spent traveling doing shows all over the world writing and working with other artists weve really had time to mature into women and master our craft it shows lyrically and vocally on this album
6216594 we arent only singers we write all of our music
6216595 nicole plays guitar and deejays we are very musical and try to show this while on stage our vibe isnt like your typical group because nicole deejays shes able to command the crowd and every once and a while well bring the guitar out on stage to show our versatility
6216596 were so excited about the music weve recorded for this album weve grown so much in the last few years and experienced love heartbreak fun times sad times and everything in between the content on the musical is really reflective of our personal experiences
6216597 were giving our fans a glimpse into our lives as nicole and natalie also the production on this album is extremely tight we worked with some of the most talented writers and producers in the industry the album is a pop r amp b album with a hip hop base its very true to who we are and is finely crafted we cant wait to release it
6216598 we grew up in a household where music was always played our dad deejayed from sunrise to sunset its because of him that we learned to appreciate all genres of music and have always been open to experimenting with different sounds and vibes
6216599 when we auditioned for cipha we didnt know what to expect but he embraced our performance and soon after asked us to hit the studio with him
6216600 at our first session he played us the coolie dance riddim and within 30 minutes of hearing it and vibing out wed written
6216601 we had no idea what would come of it but he kept saying the song was gonna be big same way he believed in us we believed in him and the song took off
6216602 when we were signed to universal records we always felt disconnected they didnt understand us as a group and didnt give us the proper attention a label should give any artist they are trying to propel to success
6216603 after our last situation ended we knew it was important to sign with someone who believed in us our movement and our music from the beginning bryan leach got it it was as if he was a part of our team even prior to signing to his label

6216622 six good innings how one small town became a little league giant
6216623 four days to glory wrestling with the soul of the american heartland
6216624 im a dad and im a little league coach and my two boys are 14 and 10
6216625 a few years ago were at the sea ranch in a remote part of northern california on vacation and im just staring out at the ocean and the trees and this really peaceful idyllic community not really doing much of anything but relaxing
6216626 but as the days went on i realized that every afternoon was appointment tv for them they were so intrigued and in overhearing their conversations toms river kept coming up so my first curiosity was why is it that they know who toms river is when theyve never seen them play but every year the town comes up in some conversation toms river is sort of the industry standard
6216627 theres no way that should have happened and i wondered what does this do to kids of toms river today when they have this legacy to live up to what are the expectations like and what does that do to the kids and the adults that are involved
6216628 the last real season a hilarious look back at 1975
6216629 and one thing i found is that toms river is a place where these kids seem older off the field theyre in sixth grade theres nothing older about them when theyre not playing baseball theyre playing guitar hero they dont seem like older souls they seem like kids to me
6216630 but on the field the winning experience and level of expectation forces them into this mode of operation it makes them look older on the field than they really are youre conditioned in little league to seeing kids kicking balls all over the place and dropping flies its age appropriate and normal but they dont do that in toms river
6216631 they coach the same way i do but baseballs what they do if youre an athlete where my kids are growing up you might play baseball and you
6216632 the book is about middle class americans whose kids happen to like baseball in a town where the tradition says the bar is set extremely high
6216633 it turns out that if the bar is way up there theyll reach for it and they have fun while theyre doing it
6216634 the drop below 1 4656 to 1 4630 completed wave v of 5 and the 5 wave drop from 1 6039 the advance from the low is probably just wave i of a in the a b c correction that is underway now the advance that ensues is expected to reach just shy of 1 50 at minimum

6216643 its a pretty barren area without cell phone coverage the guys tried to put out the fire but couldnt do it so they unhooked the tractor from the trailer
6216644 we have a destroyed trailer with a lot of burnt contents weve deemed from pictures that the contents arent worth taking to california well stop in wyoming and drop off four of our employees to sift through the contents and well pick up the two truck drivers and take them to sonoma with us

6216667 torture has done tremendous damage to americas reputation around the world violates u s and international law and makes it harder to fight the war on terror its time to turn this page in our nations history and outlaw torture and secret detentions once and for all

6216950 during last years trial numerous exhibits were entered into evidence establishing both isnas and naits intimate relationship with the muslim brotherhood the palestine committee and the defendants in this case
6216951 they were intimately connected with the hlf and its assigned task of providing financial support to hamas that isna and nait appeared in these documents and share a common history with these defendants is a reflection of the evidence not any attempt to disparage or vilify

6216954 after the killing of our officers we were given some of the names of the murderers we tracked them down immediately and captured these two guys who were later convicted of being the killers
6216955 it is a total fabrication and the intention of the report is to depict it as if there is a proxy war between eritrea and ethiopia

6216959 the campaign is aimed at ending illegal businesses built on the streets to help police perform security patrols and to revive the lost image of the capital said mohamed dheere
6216960 i think the structures are illegal and worth demolishing because they are built in areas not set aside for kiosks or stalls
6216961 but they were very helpful for our businesses we were inter dependent
6216962 the cabinet is largely a benchmark that has been used to gauge how influential a certain clan is in the government going by the portfolio being held by a clan representative
6216963 these clan fighters also make up a large part of the insurgents because many are sympathisers of the ousted islamists
6216964 ethiopia is looking for a partner so that it can contain separatist forces in the ogaden region and the interim administration is the most likely choice
6216965 the zeal with which ethiopia is carrying out the operation against the insurgents and clan fighters in mogadishu is a clear indication that crippling their military power and influence is another way of countering rebels in ogaden region
6216966 this was just a group of businessmen and members of the hawiye clan whose goal was to get power and shield their interests through islam

6216974 upholding our islamic responsibility countering the ideologies that fuel terrorism
6216975 without muslims leading the effort to reject the ends of the islamic state and defend societies like america which are rooted in universal religious freedom and the separation of religion and government we will not see the ultimate defeat of militant islamists
6216976 aifd is founded upon the premise that it is our primary muslim responsibility to foster ijtihad modern interpretation of our scripture today that ijtihad must be focused on the rescue of spiritual islam from the clutches of political islamists we reject political islam regardless of whether muslims are a minority or a majority and we believe that when given the opportunity to bring this discourse to the mosque most devout muslims will agree that the most sacred and pure practice of islam is one which is wholly free and unencumbered by coercion or any mandate from the state or government
6216977 with the ever increasing threat of militant islamist terror it is imperative that the activist muslim community wake up and direct their valuable resources toward fighting the root cause of terrorism which arises from dreams of political islam
6216978 the reality is that our security is not threatened as much by the tactic of terrorism but more so by those individuals who are driven by the political ideology that feeds the mind set of radical islamism
6216979 the only effective counter terrorism is one that attacks the fuel and root cause of the islamist terrorists political islam and their dreams of an islamic state

6216989 the jews distort words from their meanings they killed the prophets and worshipped idols
6216990 those young people who explode themselves to kill the jews were not committing suicide but jihad
6216991 they are mujahedeen because there is no way to struggle and fight the jews except that way allah bless those martyrs
6216992 allah says he who equips a warrior of jihad is like the one makes jihad himself
6216993 there are a range of ways in which third american scientific resources receives commitment for five million
6216994 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

6217142 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6217143 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6217144 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised

6217147 i think i would term this addition through subtraction for monsanto
6217148 did they really need to spend their time defending this product when its not the reason people are buying their stock
6217149 it allows monsanto to focus on its core seeds and traits business
6217150 critically we remain focused on the health and care of the cow in working with farmers to increase global milk supply
6217151 because they are partners in crime with monsanto and the biotech industry pushing largely untested and unlabeled genetically engineered products on an unwilling but often gullible public
6217152 interesting piece on william bruce and interesting in that its the very case that fuller torreys treatment advocacy center has been using to argue to change laws in maine and attack the p and as
6217153 simply put in 10 years of reporting on social issues mental health ive never heard of a p and a rolling over a hospital like that you guys have a very extreme case in your article but you are acting as if this is common please its not
6217154 whats more you quote a doc calling advocates biased but have you ever considered how deeply docs are biased
6217155 can you point me to the published scientific evidence that outpatient treatment actually works
6217156 you are doing little in your article but operating from some deeply biased assumptions im sure your editors are cool with that but im not you engaged in nothing but advocacy in your piece a 1 no less awesome and if you cant see that then i cannot help you out
6217157 obviously i expect zero response from you all but i thought id just pass along my thoughts on what strikes me as being one of the more ignorant one sided pieces on mental health i have seen in ages
6217158 the revealing medical records are posted to a web site www amybruce org along with a summary and a detailed chronology fulbright lawyers created the documents and the web site which proved to be powerful tools in joe bruces effort to change the laws
6217159 helen bailey stated that she had reviewed the medical record and saw no documentation to support williams having to remain at riverview tab 16 progress note from the treatment team meeting dated 3 23 06
6217160 i think the advocacy services work best when the advocates see themselves as able to work with the doctors and the other staff at the hospital to get for the patient what that particular patient needs most there are advocates that dont believe that mental disorders are real who dont believe that hospitalization has a role for any patient or that treatment for psychiatric disorders can ever be helpful
6217161 i think clinical services work best when the providers see themselves as able to work with the patients lawyers and other advocates to get for the client what that particular client wants most there are clinicians who dont believe that rights are real who dont believe judges should be able to override clinical decisions or that refusing treatment can ever be helpful
6217162 blackballing patient advocates without raising the slightest hint of scepticism about psychiatric treatment itself given the recent publicity and evidence about the toxic effects of psychopharmacology and the iatrogenic effects of standard treatment protocols on behavioral and physical outcomes is just mind boggling

6217170 whether they paid too high a price to get into this project remains to be seen
6217171 the coffee is cold and the donuts are stale by the time information gets down to the end of the table
6217172 this is a significant piece of work that could create millions of person hours of employment

6217215 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6217216 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

6217218 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6217219 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6217220 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6217221 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6217222 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6217223 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6217224 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6217225 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6217226 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6217227 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6217228 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6217229 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6217230 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6217231 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6217232 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6217266 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6217267 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6217268 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6217269 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6217270 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6217271 speaking to a cuban american audience in miami in august 2007 he said
6217272 we do have to crack down on those employers that are taking advantage of the situation
6217273 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6217274 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
6217275 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6217276 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
6217277 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
6217278 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation we can turned out sic the lights five minutes earlier we dont have to drive the extra block
6217279 im proud of that record from fighting for the recognition of doctor martin luther kings birthday in my state to sponsoring specific legislation that would prevent discrimination
6217280 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6217281 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6217282 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6217283 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6217284 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose any serious threat to us
6217285 if that strategy made sense and would lead ultimately to the pullout of u s troops but in the short term required additional troop strength to protect those who are already on the ground then thats something i would support
6217286 given the situation on the ground i think if we had our troops out in four years that would be an extraordinary accomplishment
6217287 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
6217288 what the world should interpret is my consistent position which is i believe in trade
6217289 i just want to make sure that the rules of the road apply to everybody and they are fair and that they reflect the interests of workers and not just corporate profits
6217290 i said well i would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al qaeda if they were in iraq so ya know this is how politics works mccain thought that he could make a clever point by saying well let me give you some news barack al qaeda is in iraq like i wasnt reading the papers like i like i didnt know what was going on
6217291 well first of all i do know that al qaeda is in iraq thats why ive said we should continue to strike al qaeda targets but i have some news for john mccain and that is that there was no such thing as al qaeda in iraq until george bush and john mccain decided to invade iraq
6217292 i intend to bring it to an end so that we can actually start going after al qaeda in afghanistan and in the hills of pakistan like we should have been doing in the first place thats the news john mccain
6217293 when we talked back in november of 04 after your election i said theres been enormous speculation about your political future
6217294 i will serve out my full six year term you know tim if you get asked enough sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things but my thinking has not changed
6217295 so you will not run for president or vice president in 2008
6217296 i happen to be a proponent of single payer universal healthcare coverage thats what id like to see
6217297 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer healthcare
6217298 he gets an asterisk that says he is trying to be different but overall the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates whether or not they are lobbyists
6217299 a ccording to the center for responsive politics 14 of obamas top 20 contributors employed lobbyists this year spending a total of 16 2 million to influence the federal government in the first six months of 2007
6217300 contrary to the claims of some i have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking but as president of the united states i would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interests of the united states
6217301 w ould you be willing to meet separately without precondition during the first year of your administration in washington or anywhere else with the leaders of iran syria venezuela cuba and north korea in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries
6217302 i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration is ridiculous
6217303 senator youve said before that youd meet with president ahmadinejad
6217304 yeah nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries i find many of president ahmadinejads statements odious and ive said that repeatedly and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have american interests at heart but what i also believe is that as john f kennedy said we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate
6217305 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
6217306 one other issue thats of great importance here in the district as well is gun control you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c handgun ban
6217307 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul slashed the rolls by 80 percent obama leaves out however that he was against the 1996 federal legislation which precipitated the caseload reduction

6217311 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue it does however grant retroactive immunity and i will work in the senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses so i support the compromise but do so with a firm pledge that as president i will carefully monitor the program review the report by the inspectors general and work with the congress to take any additional steps i deem necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the american people
6217312 senator whats your reaction to the supreme courts decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist
6217313 i disagree with the decision i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that that does not violate our constitution now i think its you know had the supreme court said we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that its done in a careful and appropriate way that would have been one thi ng but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagreed with that decision
6217314 i am happy to have a debate with john mccain and george bush about foreign policy if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world that is a conversation i am happy to have because i believe that there is no separation between john mccain and george bush when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
6217315 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and
6217316 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
6217317 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
6217318 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
6217319 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6217320 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
6217321 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
6217322 i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while thats why i made the smart choice with smart beer stampede light its beer plus
6217323 port of xbasic capable of creating dlls as tiny as access violation error when i was experimenting my first dll with
6217324 see this is where he sleeps in the summer he sleeps this side but in winter he moves to the other mattress we have to manage with just these two coolers so he moves to be more comfortable
6217325 with this medal we hope our needs are better looked after than before here there are 20 people to a room with two people to a bed not all rooms have coolers like ours and we have to share the space with rats and other animals here theres room for everybody
6217326 this is how weve been living we have to make do with what we have its very tough but what choice do we have
6217327 perhaps now that sushil had got a medal more money will come into the sport we have brought it to the attention of the authorities many times but it hasnt made a difference so we carry on
6217328 this is him with his 2005 arjuna award and heres another during the 1998 asian cadet junior meet where he won gold now he has an olympic medal
6217329 we are all very proud of what he has achieved and we cant wait to meet him at the airport
6217330 sushil also had the same difficulties but he had said hell win a medal and he did here at the stadium there are wrestlers from all over the country who are living in these conditions and i hope they are all inspired by what he has done wrestlers dont get jobs so many are unwilling to take it up seriously but now things will be different
6217331 callous attitude of the sports authority of india sai administration could seriously hamper indias medal prospects
6217332 the only thing you have to do is sweep it off once in a while
6217333 neighbors look at their lawns which are weeds or are hard to maintain and they look at this and the first thing they want to do is install it themselves
6217334 we put a lot of money into this to keep our house looking good to keep our lawn looking good
6217335 we keep telling them its time for the covenants to be updated and step into the real world
6217336 im not looking to ruffle feathers i want my lawn to look good like any other homeowner
6217337 these technologies are so new that the rules of the road dont really exist yet
6217338 i think the appropriate role for state and local government is to some extent to take all of the different types of concerns and try to find a reasonable balance that achieves the best public good
6217339 when you come back next year this is liable to be all weeds or all dirt or something
6217340 from months back we were prepared by this time with the intention to enjoy the company of our families our neighbors to the maximum friendships and also with all that one people who take advantage of her vacations to share these dates with us
6217341 long track record of supporting a reckless and extreme foreign policy
6217342 his tendency is to shoot first and ask first questions later it is dangerous and we cant afford four more years of this reckless foreign policy
6217343 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgement
6217344 the fact of the matter is his judgement which is clearly documented on the record about what to do in iraq was wrong
6217345 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabres and look for a military solution
6217346 after saying it would be wrong to vote against funds for troops in combat obama did just that
6217347 ni polvos m gicos se atreve a decir que se mueve gracias a un propulsor h brido que rinde 313 c v sin especificar cuantos de ellos son el ctricos y cuantos mezclan la avena con gasolina
6217348 tendency is to shoot first and to ask questions later
6217349 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a
6217350 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
6217351 he has consistently been quick draw mccain here on every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution
6217352 thats what people think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same s been doing for the last eight years
6217353 i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6217354 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6217355 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6217356 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6217357 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6217358 i have never suggested that picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6217359 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6217360 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6217361 this is my third pair of contacts in my left eye this week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of them
6217362 shaikhs testimonial was supposed to be the most crucial in the case
6217363 while we were preparing to prove that shaikh had never confessed his role in the murder the police had relied on the alleged confession given by shaikh his death would automatically hamper the case of another deported aide of dawood ibrahim abdul qayyum shaikh
6217364 it gives you a chance to succeed if you focus on the little things
6217365 every minute is accounted for every second one thing we dont do is waste time
6217366 im not gonna say im never gonna do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6217367 i cant believe i got in that state because it is totally not in my repertoire to do something like that im actually a bit of control freak

6217399 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability

6217465 the forest county potawatomi community is grateful to have been blessed with the resources to invest in indns list and ilef as tribal citizens we saw the impact of their accomplishments in the last election more importantly we see the potential of what can be done in 2008 and 2010
6217466 american indian voters have a great opportunity to be part of historical firsts in 2008 all of us can help shape the future of america by becoming more involved in the political process by working on campaigns by voting and yes by running for political office
6217467 i applaud the forest county potawatomi community and their visionary leaders for helping make a difference for indian country by changing the face of politics in america today
6217468 at indns list we are humbled honored and delighted to have the support of the forest county potawatomi community partners like fcp will truly make 2008 the year of the indian that significant and generous contribution will allow us to support candidates train and assist critical staff working on the campaigns make direct donations to candidates and endorse and help even more american indian candidates
6217469 we are still assessing 10 additional races this year we are supporting 28 candidates who hail from 11 states and are members of 19 different tribes this is a significant increase over our first two election cycles of 2006 and 2007 when we endorsed a total of 28 candidates in those 2 years we are sitting on a 79 win record and with this all star team of candidates we hope to increase that win rate in november
6217470 the main goal for indns list education fund ilef is to get more american indians involved in the political process by registering them to vote and then mobilizing them to get to the polls with more indians registered we are investing in a political infrastructure that will in the long run ensure there are indians who have already participated in politics at the grassroots level and in five or ten years are prepared to run for office themselves
6217471 the forest county potawatomi communitys previous donations funded indn campaign camps in 2005 and 2007 where our candidates were trained their investment helped indns list candidates win in 2006 and we look forward to the same victorious results in november 2008

6217559 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6217560 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6217561 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6217562 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6217563 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6217564 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6217565 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6217566 look what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps

6217572 human rights matters to us every year not just in olympic year
6217573 we want them to extend the greater freedoms that they have given to journalists and the press at the time of the olympics beyond the olympics and further on

6217582 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6217583 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6217584 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6217585 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6217586 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6217587 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6217588 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6217589 no more dithering no more delaying no more excuses this is the report that they called for they said their decision would hinge on the reports recommendations so with its release the opposition have got to come forward and state their position
6217590 this device gives paramedics another resource in managing situations where a disturbed patient is in urgent need if medical help
6217591 it allows challenging situations to be managed without compromising the safety and treatment of the patient of medical staff
6217592 it is important to note that in six cases where patients had been handcuffed by police ambulance paramedics were able to remove the police handcuffs once the mechanical restraint devices were applied
6217593 this means patients can be treated in health context rather than in law and order context
6217594 police will still be involved in high risk situations and will accompany some patients in an ambulance or in a police vehicle where necessary
6217595 the device provides paramedics with an additional option for managing situations where a behaviourally disturbed patient is in need of medical intervention and in many cases will increase the level of safety and dignity for the patient
6217596 so far more than 400 paramedics have been trained in the use of the devices and are authorised to use them
6217597 i tested the all website combos such as obamakaine com etc the only one that works is obamabayh org which redirects to obamas campaign website try it yourself i call it here 1 27 pm 08 20 08 barack obama taps indiana senator evan bayh for vp
6217598 users might not see significant change on the ui of the web site although we have added many new features but the main change is actually on the backend we carefully redesign our database which will allow us add more cool features on the frontend
6217599 our aim is to receive international guarantees of ukraines territorial integrity which is only guarantee possible in the framework of collective security
6217600 o executivo em geral n o se preocupa muito com contabilidade mas ser necess ria a mobiliza o de gestores no processo de mudan a para as normas do ifrs
6217601 a empresa tem que entender o que vai mudar e comunicar ao mercado o que est acontecendo
6217602 falta pouco tempo se a comunica o for ruim o mercado vai reagir
6217603 o resultado final ser igual nada mudou mas isso precisa ser explicado ao mercado
6217604 it makes me feel very bitter and very angry the fact is that we have a right to be there and to have our group represented for all the patients that we represent
6217605 on the face of it the rent seems extremely high at 535 per week that seems extremely excessive rent to me but the living allowance is certainly in line with the centrelink payments so you cant really quibble about that
6217606 they need to come to one of our meetings and see what we do and see the lengths that we go to to represent not only patel patients but all patients of queensland health and to see how our group functions and operates before they criticise us
6217607 were still lobbying for queensland health to be fixed and we believe its still a basket case
6217608 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors

6217612 as a matter of good faith theyve raised a safety issue with me i dont believe theres anything in it but im more than happy to really double check and thats whats being done at the moment
6217613 transformar a soja na matriz principal um erro porque o pre o determinado no mercado internacional
6217614 neste caso o uso da soja para o biodiesel pode at estimular os pre os
6217615 de repente eu vejo a infla o brasileira causada por commodities e a gente n o pode fazer nada
6217616 ainda nem come amos a dar uma dimens o industrial para o biodiesel da mamona e muitos est o falando que o programa j fracassou

6217619 a cord can prevent a bird from feeding or breathing and if it gets wrapped too tightly around the limbs such as a leg it could cut off circulation to that limb and cause the loss of that limb which would be extremely fatal for that bird
6217620 its thought that the gifts are some type of trinket that the males will bring to the females for his failure to deliver food
6217621 sort of like in human terms if a boyfriend brings flowers to his girlfriend if hes doing something wrong that makes her feel bad
6217622 theyve learned the insulating value of plastic bags and use them to keep warm like you or i might use a rain slicker
6217623 probably the biggest impact would be the plastic bags and sheeting that we see in some of the nests especially black plastic
6217624 a lot of times we see the eggs have been covered over by these plastic materials and you can imagine on a hot summer day those eggs covered over are going to cook underneath the plastic it probably results in the mortality of those eggs
6217625 the latest round of results means big cap information technology companies are going to make it through the rest of the year
6217626 theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar this is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line
6217627 this pushes out the wall of worry for tech investors until another 90 days
6217628 it looks like results are going to be close to normal for these two groups
6217629 it is not to say nobody is concerned about these things there is tremendous concern
6217630 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6217631 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6217632 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6217633 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat

6217640 eh not a big deal hell be totally fine before the season starts
6217641 a viol ncia e a persuas o podem destruir a verdade mas n o podem substitu la
6217642 fue bien armamos toda una presentaci n con mi equipo de gesti n y explicamos al municipio el qu y por qu lo hicimos cu nto gastamos y cuales son las inversiones que pensamos hacer de aqu a fin de a o
6217643 la nica manera de que una gesti n de gobierno sea eficiente es reconociendo las limitaciones y nosotros nos reconocemos con much simas limitaciones
6217644 pasamos de ese municipio tradicional que se encargaba del alumbrado la limpieza el mantenimiento de los caminos a un municipio que pretende poner en su agenda temas de infancia y minoridad trata de personas empleo la producci n y el desarrollo local
6217645 fe un espacio para que los vecinos tengan contacto directo con los funcionarios de cada rea y plantear sus inquietudes y dudas acerca del funcionamiento municipal como as tambi n de los servicios que est n prestando
6217646 quisimos contar mostrar los trabajos pero por otro lado crear un espacio de participaci n donde a trav s de esto buscar que los vecinos puedan escuchar y despu s acercarse a los funcionarios a dar propuestas o recibir mas informaci n
6217647 el objetivo de esto es tratar de discutir los que venimos desarrollando y esto posible porque hemos podido consolidar un equipo de trabajo de confianza y solidaridad tenemos que rescatar el aporte de los trabajadores municipales que son parte importante y las actividades est n en marcha gracias a ellos y tambi n instituciones intermedias gubernamentales o no comerciales entre otras tantas instituciones
6217648 creo que hay que reformar la carta org nica municipal pero hay puntos que no estoy de acuerdo como por ejemplo el aumento del n mero de concejales la incorporaci n de un viceintendente pero si concretamente estoy de acuerdo que se debe limitar la reelecci n de los concejales y los ediles
6217649 particularmente creo que se debe modificar el art culo que prev solamente cuatro secretar as para la municipalidad de eldorado y elevar el n mero a ocho fundamentalmente para elevar al rango de secretar a lo que tiene que ver con la cooperaci n escolar y fundamentalmente llevar al rango de secretar a dos sectores del ejecutivo municipal como son deportes y turismo
6217650 adem s creo que el concejo deliberante debe tener un presupuesto desenganchado del ejecutivo municipal debemos convocar a la necesidad de la reforma y a partir de ah plantear los puntos que se deben reformar
6217651 podr a ser una alternativa que se convoque a convenci n constituyente conjuntamente con los comicios del a o pr ximo
6217652 el intendente y los concejales deben tener la oportunidad de ser reelegidos una sola vez es decir puede estar en funciones dos per odos luego descanas uno y volver
6217653 porque quiero saber cual es la impronta que le dar al partido fundamentalmente el a o pr ximo un a o electoral m xime que en el 2009 ser presidente del concejo deliberante de eldorado
6217654 hasta el momento losada no tuvo contacto conmigo pero estoy siguiendo por todos los medios y por la p gina digital del partido los movimientos de la presidenta y del comit
6217655 vamos a acompa ar la gesti n de mar a losada

6217660 when people dump domestic bunnies it isnt setting them free
6217661 there are lots of burrows so we wait by an area if we know an area they frequent sometimes they will stick their nose out if they see a flashlight they are curious animals
6217662 a volunteer sprained an ankle last week were dealing with spiders and snakes in the thick brush
6217663 wed much prefer it if people took proper care of rabbits
6217664 the real worry is that we could end up with a jillion bunnies
6217665 last weekend we discovered seven bunnies here some of them little ones born out here we are having bunnies born in the park it is a scary problem
6217666 everyone was over here and the little guy just sat there watching all of the action going on
6217667 we are happy to share tips on how to care for bunnies
6217668 it didnt feel like it was really happening until we were all in the water
6217669 i think people really want to be involved with things that are important
6217670 that was really encouraging to me i was struck by that
6217671 when we rolled into new raymer co we were riding around town looking for a place to pitch some tents when a woman in a beat up old el camino pulled up next to us and offered us a place to stay in the local 4h barn
6217672 she flagged us over to the car with a budweiser can in her hand hanging out of the car we slept well indoors that night listening to the rain crashing on the roof above us
6217673 i was not a cyclist at all i was a runner
6217674 i feel like they were a huge part of my identity i dont have to worry about those things
6217675 it is such a blessing knowing that college aged kids are joining us in the battle to defeat the mind set of poverty and bring the gospel from the pulpit of a bicycle
6217676 it is amazing how god can unite us across a continent and across the globe to help those in need we thank all the npu students for letting the world know about how god is moving in zambia through acirfa
6217677 to have such a large number of students not present and its the second day of school there is some concern about that myself along with a few of my staff members we would get in our cars ourselves a lot last year to go and get students and see whats going on and to have this partnership with north charleston is just fantastic it really sets the tone that school is important beginning from the very first day
6217678 kids not being in school first of all theyre going to be behind when they do decide to go to school but as long as theyre out on the street with nothing to do theres always a chance that they may become involved in some sort of criminal activity
6217679 many hundreds of thousands of dollars were expended on that stretch and it is falling apart everywhere
6217680 there has been a lot of taxpayers money wasted there if the job was done with council money wed certainly be hearing about it
6217681 there are also bad potholes at the bottom of the hill and the situation out there is particularly bad at night

6217703 sounds to me like these colleges are just tired of dealing with all the paperwork involved in punishing underage drinking
6217704 yes i think the school system should be able to punish kids that are not behaving
6217705 the real problem with the younger generation is they are not punished at all
6217706 what kind of message does this give to our children that they should live in fear of adults that are there to love and protect them

6217729 every time your ad could potentially show quality score matters
6217730 with the onset of quality score the bar has been raised and relevancy has become much more scientific if you want to approach it correctly
6217731 quality score takes search back to the basics back to the fundamentals providing the users the direct access to finding the content they want at the time they want it

6217736 while many people might strongly object to these opinions there is no room under the first amendment to punish a group simply for presenting or sponsoring expression that angers offends or even incites hatred of someone else
6217737 every time i turn around im writing a check to the school or for school stuff
6217738 unfortunately our money is not going as far as it was a few years ago
6217739 i dont care what the commercial says wal mart isnt always the cheapest
6217740 target may have these few items cheaper and h e b might have these items cheaper
6217741 what you buy today might not fit them two or three months down the road
6217742 its worth it to pay full price if they are items they want and are going to wear
6217743 let them buy one or two items and then say the rest were going to have to buy on sale people cant afford to be wasteful right now it doesnt pay to buy things the kids arent going to wear a lot of people are strapped stores arent getting as much foot traffic
6217744 people are changing their shopping habits very dramatically right now
6217745 this year is the year of scouring the web for online discounts people dont want to spend money on gas if you can get your kids feet sized in the store its not that hard to shop online
6217746 it may level out but i dont think it will ever level out like it was a few years ago
6217747 were an everyday place were not a special occasion place you can come here a few times a week and always find something different
6217748 we certainly get a range of people youll have people in suits skateboarders even the odd gang member in here all we ask is they treat the place with respect
6217749 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6217750 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6217751 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6217752 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6217753 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6217754 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6217755 i think one of the most important issues is that people overlook the significance of water this isnt about shortages of water nor is it about quality specifically its about recognition of the fact that water permeates every aspect of our life from manufacturing to growing food to health care to sustaining life itself

6217770 quando um pa s importa produtos de outros pa ses importante ter consci ncia do impacto gerado sobre os recursos de gua nas regi es em que estes produtos foram produzidos
6217771 por exemplo uma camisa produzida com algod o cultivado no paquist o ou no uzbequist o requer 2 7 mil litros de gua numa regi o que j apresenta sinais de escassez
6217772 no caso do brasil importante que o governo as empresas e os consumidores tenham maior consci ncia deste impacto preciso saber onde e em que condi es estes produtos s o produzidos
6217773 se um produto produzido em uma regi o amea ada h duas alternativas ou discutir formas de melhorar o gerenciamento local da gua ou mudar de fornecedor o que n o podemos fazer exportar nossos problemas para outros pa ses e consumir gua de regi es amea adas
6217774 o que nos preocupa particularmente que enormes quantidades destes produtos s o cultivadas em regi es mais secas do mundo onde os recursos da gua ou j est o amea ados ou muito provavelmente estar o sob amea a no futuro pr ximo

6217782 we are also going to stop the privatization madness of governor daniels
6217783 its all about saving tax dollars why you would throw them away just to have a bigger government is not clear to me
6217784 everyone throughout the state now recognizes he has not been truthful weve seen a great deal of privatization and not only is it not working its probably costing taxpayers additional dollars
6217785 it was beautiful to be back a bit less to be 2 0 down
6217786 there was a little lack of attention in part because while they might not be a great team they have great physical and athletic qualities and they showed them
6217787 then we started to speed things up especially in the second half we fixed the result which is always important
6217788 we went after the win until the end passing the ball around quickly
6217789 it wasnt easy against such a physical side they were very tall they only conceded us the flanks

6217792 this is a very valuable acknowledgement of the range and quality of music making and a signal of aspiration to music makers in the city and elsewhere but it is also absolutely invaluable in terms of glasgows tourism brand nationally and internationally as unesco gives a stamp of world class quality
6217793 i am confident this can only boost our musical ambitions and encourage and nurture future musical talent
6217794 glasgow has always been a city of music this formally recognises both that musical heritage and the flourishing contemporary scene it will encourage all musical interests in the city to work as partners to carry our reputation forward in the coming century

6217802 so the tools are there id rather be working with this than with a bunch of experienced guys who cant play
6217803 the maturity level is always your no 1 concern when youve got a lot of young guys
6217804 i think youve got to be patient with them weve been through this drill a number of years ago when we were forced to play a lot of young guys early
6217805 there were difficult moments but the players were able to dig deep as they did at the end of the match
6217806 that was a positive we scored three goals but conceded two
6217807 this was a more open team a new team a new generation with a new way of playing
6217808 thats part of the game if you want to push forward open the game a bit more play more freely you give chances to your opponents
6217809 but between winning 3 2 and 1 0 i would choose 3 2
6217810 we wanted to win but it wasnt to be it was a good work out and i was able to blood a number of players and they all did well which was great
6217811 overall i think we passed it quite well at times northern ireland as we knew were going to make it difficult for us i think we were lacking a little cutting edge which could have won us the game
6217812 i think the tackle in the first half was enthusiasm from a youngster and the second one was innocuous really
6217813 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

6217819 your delay this evening is caused by the line controller suffering from e amp b syndrome not knowing his elbow from his backside ill let you know any further information as soon as im given any
6217820 do you want the good news first or the bad news the good news is that last friday was my birthday and i hit the town and had a great time the bad news is that there is a points failure somewhere between stratford and east ham which means we probably wont reach our destination
6217821 ladies and gentlemen we apologise for the delay but there is a security alert at victoria station and we are therefore stuck here for the foreseeable future so lets take our minds off it and pass some time together all together now ten green bottles hanging on a wall

6217835 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6217836 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6217837 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6217838 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6217880 we are social animals and we need structure like marriage between a man and a woman to survive
6217881 human species is doomed because gay marriage will make straight people run away and be gay
6217882 but religious postulation against marriage equality is too easy both for gay marriage opponents to espouse and for its supporters to mock said peter sprigg who prefers a public policy tack as a vice president for policy with the family research council sprigg is counting on the highly publicized gay weddings this week to fuel support for novembers measure defining marriage in california as a union between a man and a woman sprigg says focusing on individual couples gay or straight is missing the larger point
6217883 dont focus on individual couples dont put a human face on this issue weve got to keep the enemy

6217888 these werent a couple of young people who made a simple mistake to me the plan to book a catholic hall and then lodge a human rights complaint was just another attempt to gain acceptance for the gay rights agenda

6217934 especially for funerals clearly that is one rule which could be looked at but i wouldnt like to make any judgement on it until i see any proposals coming forward officially

6217954 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
6217955 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
6217956 by refusing to send screeners of the 90210 premiere to critics the cw has aroused deep suspicions

6217966 we were essentially using some of our internal savings our rainy day accounts so if we have a more serious problem next year we cant keep doing this forever so any state cuts would be on top of the fact that our current budget has been relying on savings right now

6218008 we will write to the election commission requesting it to ban the bjp
6218009 no charge has been proved against it in the court of law
6218010 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6218011 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6218012 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6218013 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
6218014 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6218015 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6218016 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6218017 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6218018 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6218019 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6218020 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6218021 the army deployed in the valley should be given free hand to shoot the terrorists
6218022 i am not i mean maybe i am its just um are these uh
6218023 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6218024 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6218025 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6218026 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6218027 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6218028 eventually the mud will wash away the tribe will clean up whatever trash and it will be as beautiful as ever
6218029 it was one of the most invigorating and exciting times ive ever spent outdoors
6218030 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6218031 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6218032 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6218033 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6218034 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6218035 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6218036 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6218037 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6218038 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6218039 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6218040 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6218041 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6218042 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6218043 the more you see of anything the less special it becomes
6218044 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6218045 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6218046 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6218047 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6218048 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6218049 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6218050 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6218051 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6218052 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive

6218061 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

6218110 based on the work of carl jung change is perceived as death in other words we dont want to imagine that anything is going to be different our lives are laid out in a linear fashion i do this and then i do that if a certain amount of change must be dispersed in the daily lives of our society we will do everything possible to avoid that change or deny it this is because it is incredibly difficult to shift paradigms the way in which we perceive the world
6218111 we fell talking about the speculative boom that was then at its height in america he said it was essentially an inflation of credit by bulling securities while it lasted there would be a kind of prosperity but there was nothing behind it but faith at any time someone might start a selling that would collapse the whole thing
6218112 currencies rose and towered above others and broke like atlantic waves and people found the good money in their banks changed to useless paper in a period of a few months it became more and more difficult to carry on foreign trade because of the increasing uncertainty of payment trade and industry sickened and lost heart more and more in this disastrous uncertainty it was like being in an earthquake when it seems equally unsafe to stand still or run away and the multitudes of unemployed increased continually the economically combatant nations entrenched themselves behind tariffs played each other tricks with loans repudiations sudden inflations and deflations and no power in the world seemed able to bring them into any concerted action to arrest and stop their common d gringolade quick deterioration or breakdown
6218113 the year 1933 closed in a phase of dismayed apprehension it was like that chilly stillness that wordless interval of suspense that comes at times before the breaking of a storm the wheels of economic life were turning only reluctantly and uncertainly the millions of unemployed accumulated and became more and more plainly a challenge and a menace there had been a considerable if inadequate building boom after the peace of versailles but after 1930 new construction fell off more and more
6218114 there is a strong opposition on the part of great interests in america to the president franklin d roosevelt who has made himself the spear head of the collectivising drive they want to put the brake now on his progressive socialisation of the nation and quite possibly at the cost of increasing social friction they may slow down the drift to socialism very considerably but it is unbelievable that they dare provoke the social convulsion that would ensue upon a deliberate reversal of the engines or upon any attempt to return to the glorious days of big business wild speculation and mounting unemployment before 1927 they will merely slow down the drive for in the world now all roads lead to socialism or social dissolution

6218239 no esper bamos que los juegos ol mpicos fueran una poderosa herramienta de marketing pero lo que ha ocurrido es exactamente lo contrario el mercado no ha madurado como el de los ee uu o el del reino unido en t rminos de cultura de marca y aqu la cuesti n de la celebridad sigue siendo muy fuerte si puedes vincular a liu xiang o yao ming a tu producto eso tiene un enorme impacto
6218240 otros pa ses est n interesados en las olimpiadas pero en china casi el 90 de la poblaci n los apoya apasionadamente y quiere involucrarse

6218259 ive spent a large part of my career at united and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6218260 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and caliber will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honors
6218261 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6218262 for me to write i need certain conditions one of quiet isolation not a city
6218263 i was born not far from here so this weather is familiar i like the weather i like the growing season its a good place to work its really pleasant when im not here i think about it
6218264 hes a genuinely enthusiastic traveler with his feet on the ground
6218265 i realized how much was revealed everything is revealed its political realities economic realities its human condition how i felt about a place in the past and how i feel now
6218266 with that trip i felt such a continuous sense of discovery self discovery and discovery i thought maybe the ultimate in this would be to take the same trip again a trip that had meant a lot to me in 1973
6218267 the sort of place that gives rise to the notion that the earth is flat
6218268 a great meal a binge a visit from card players an intrigue a good nights sleep and strangers monologues framed like russian short stories
6218269 i wanted to put in everything that i found lacking in the other books dialogue characters discomfort
6218270 and theroux happened to be there at the start saying im opening up the door to this wanderlust in the american soul
6218271 i never saw myself as someone like faulkner who was writing about his home the people he knew at home his patch of landscape
6218272 i never really felt that writing about medford massachusetts had a future
6218273 a kind of one upmanship on the way everyone else travels museums bad slums good solitude good companions bad airlines bad railways good it is a code and hes very strict about it and sometimes it seems so strict that im a little puzzled about the notion of purity it creates
6218274 the longer i stayed in bangalore the less i liked it
6218275 the place had not evolved it had been crudely transformed less city planning than the urban equivalent of botched cosmetic surgery

6218278 otherwise why have i written as i have theres some emptiness or disorder that ones trying to fill or find an order in if you look into history you wont find many jolly well balanced people who were writers i mean look at them
6218279 in a way you cant be a writer unless you have sort of a personality problem balanced people dont become writers obviously balanced people become gardeners they raise happy families they go to work every day they smile they have noodle salad

6218296 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff
6218297 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6218298 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6218299 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6218300 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6218301 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6218302 the budget is in meltdown the crct is a mess and you have a superintendent in hollywood taping a game show
6218303 its a show that promotes education and her job is to promote education in georgia
6218304 the majority of people coming online and buying their first computer today are doing it in emerging countries like china india and brazil
6218305 if you look at india about 67 percent or more of their workforce is going to be entirely mobile and that is driving the demand for new features in the laptop like all day connectivity long battery life high level security and uncompromising design and durability
6218306 no more dithering no more delaying no more excuses this is the report that they called for they said their decision would hinge on the reports recommendations so with its release the opposition have got to come forward and state their position
6218307 its pretty much the perfect combination of the squad car meets foot patrol
6218308 you definitely get to interface with people interact with people more on the bike
6218309 im excited weve been training a lot for it this summer
6218310 we definitely teach that your bike is part of you it can be used as a weapon of opportunity its your mode of transportation its definitely an extension of who you are and you dont want to let that go or out of your sight
6218311 we are taught that if were going that slowly and we get shoved we can put a foot down quickly and balance ourselves on our bikes and when were riding next to a partner we can grab onto a partner
6218312 the vast majority of the people down here are here to exercise their first amendment rights and we want to help protect those people and make sure they can do that in a safe manner
6218313 the biggest rate increases will be in year one and two as councils come to grips with the big job of amalgamating town plans
6218314 it grows very early actually starts growing under the ice in the spring and by the time ice is out its very near the surface shades out the native plants which tend to germinate and start growing later in the spring
6218315 the problem with curly leaf is it dies out in late june early july releasing all those nutrients back into the water column which starts the algae blooms and degradation of water quality
6218316 were hoping we get a good hard freeze early in the fall this winter freeze it out throughout the winter
6218317 and then in the spring of the year because theres no water the curly leaf isnt going to be able to establish
6218318 ive undertaken to the council that ill come back to them with the report that i get in that regard and that we wont turn the electric power on until im utterly satisfied in that regard
6218319 but in the meantime the work to have the fences put in is continuing
6218320 as a matter of good faith theyve raised a safety issue with me i dont believe theres anything in it but im more than happy to really double check and thats whats being done at the moment
6218321 we contacted mr biscardi who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process we set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer
6218322 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6218323 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6218324 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6218325 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such
6218326 this will have the same power consumption and noise level of current fans
6218327 the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6218328 estou muito feliz em disputar o bronze para n s valer como ouro

6218330 but what if this is the year one of them holds out for real
6218331 have been mobbed like rock stars at cokes pavilion on the olympic green
6218332 with coca cola chinas beijing olympic project group gm david brooks
6218333 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
6218334 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6218335 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6218336 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6218337 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6218338 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6218339 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6218340 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6218341 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie
6218342 somewhat ambiguous juxtaposition of this mythical game and the historical events of september 11th
6218343 a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power
6218344 serious research conducted by respected scholars without an ideological axe to grind has consistently found every major voucher experiment in the united states wanting cecilia rouses definitive analyses of the milwaukee voucher program and the indiana university studies of the cleveland voucher program have shown no meaningful educational performance advantage for students in those two high profile large scale voucher programs
6218345 i find that students in the milwaukee parental choice program had faster math score gains than but similar reading score gains to the comparison groups the results appear robust to data imputations and sample attrition although these deficiencies of the data should be kept in mind when interpreting the results
6218346 a sizable majority of these studies report beneficial effects of competition across all outcomes the above evidence shows reasonably consistent evidence of a link between competition choice and education quality increased competition and higher educational quality are positively correlated
6218347 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
6218348 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
6218349 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6218350 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6218351 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6218352 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6218353 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6218354 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6218355 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6218356 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6218357 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6218358 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6218359 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6218360 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6218361 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6218362 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6218363 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6218364 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6218365 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6218366 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6218367 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
6218368 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
6218369 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
6218370 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
6218371 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
6218372 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
6218373 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
6218374 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
6218375 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
6218376 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
6218377 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
6218378 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
6218379 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
6218380 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6218381 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6218382 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6218383 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6218384 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6218385 one of texas emerging photography superstars has a new style that is fresh and creative a photographer who is cutting edge has great use of light composition and originality
6218386 a good photographer captures his subject a good subject captures its photographer
6218387 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6218388 but they can also be taken away at any time
6218389 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them it just made them go with the action urgently
6218390 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6218391 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6218392 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6218393 frames his idea of patriotism in terms that call on america to live up to its ideals and promise respondents prefer his patriotism centered argument over mccains more traditional patriotic framing by 11 points
6218394 often when a sex crime is committed the community says well what was she doing why was she there the questions should be about the perpetrator
6218395 its that kind of attitude and lack of empathy with women that makes it possible to commit a crime like rape
6218396 women know there is a sexual crime problem because they are the ones that suffer men are hesitant to get involved in the issue they dont know how to get involved
6218397 we all know women in our lives theyre people who are important to us
6218398 we dont want them to be hurt so we need to change how we act
6218399 i came all the way from connecticut for this interview so id really appreciate it if we could have it today
6218400 but on the bright side jackie was just up here asking if we could raise the salary for the job to meet your requirements
6218401 those are results im asking you to look at to make sure theyre interpreted correctly

6218452 picture taken with the test camera were similar to those from the e 420 which isnt surprising as both cameras have the same sensor and image processing system test shots in outdoor lighting were bright and colorful although some highlight details were lost in very contrasty situations
6218453 the e 520 is a camera that manages to package a significant number of excellent features and solid controls into a great body but really let itself down in our performance testing theres one of the best live view modes on the market with auto focus a good image stabilization system thats built into the body comprehensive presets and a high degree of customization and control
6218454 out of all of this the obvious concern about the versatility may be that it tries to do too much without ever landing cleanly in a niche or target market that said although i never fully connected with its odd yet somehow highly functional mixture of beginner swag and advanced am swagger the olympus e 520 delivers crisp colorful shots that are hard to argue with
6218455 its a little too early to conclude anything yet other than the e 520 appears to have the potential of being a world beating camera in its class theres a few things i want to check out further such as noise at raised iso and the effect of noise reduction and shadow adjustment technology but if it performs anything like the e 3 it will be fine

6218461 the test camera came without an instruction manual but we had no trouble finding our way around the various functions the mark of an intuitive piece of equipment we liked the zappy kodak style images and were impressed with the print quality even up to a4 touch screens are not much to our liking they seem more gimmicky than useful and the zoom control is ridiculously small

6218485 it is no secret that agriprocessors was forced to cut back production of meat and poultry after more than a third of its labor force was seized in a may 12th raid by immigration and customs enforcement
6218486 while the company has made big strides in hiring new workers and restoring production it is still significantly behind may 12th levels for the kosher slaughterers shochtim and rabbis this has meant not being able to work multiple shifts and a 6 day work week cutting into their ability to make more money while also making do with the companys policy of a lag time in their paychecks

6218798 we will begin the process of getting the lookout notice against haywood lifted half a dozen agencies probing the terror e mail have not been able to find any evidence to link haywood to it and therefore he is not a suspect in the case even brain mapping and polygraph tests conducted on him have not revealed anything against him we would have allowed him to leave in a couple of days anyway
6218799 i will have to check on this technicality and examine the possibility of taking any action against him however haywood is not a suspect in the case anymore often lookout notices issued against people are challenged by them if they are not booked in a case however it is a matter of serious concern that someone who has a notice issued against him managed to leave the country the ministry of home affairs is conducting a probe into the matter
6218800 we had called haywood to the ats office on the morning of august 15 to give him an opportunity to name the officer concerned so that we could take the strictest action possible when he did not turn up an ats officer went to his house and haywood told him that he would come on august 18 as he was not feeling well the next day when some of our officers followed up with him he sent them a message saying he would meet us the following day it seems that he was misguiding and deceiving us
6218801 i am a dalit my father is an ordinary factory worker and i studied in a local college in fact i wasnt even expecting a call to appear for interviews in delhi but a couple of weeks after going through the entire procedure rahul gandhi himself called me to say that i have been selected
6218802 our area has a number of underprivileged children who dont have access to education after primary level i along with a couple of friends organised proper training for these children so that they were able to pursue higher studies
6218803 the interviews used to take place either at rahul gandhis residence at tughlaq road or at the aicc headquarters it was an elaborate process in the first round rahulji personally interacted with all the shortlisted candidates then there was a group discussion where we were questioned by a panel comprising congress leaders meenakshi natarajan mukul wasnik and jagdish tytler those shortlisted were called for an interview and a group discussion in the presence of rahul gandhi i was lucky enough to get selected and was personally intimated by him
6218804 my father is a government official no one in my family is in politics the fact that i have represented haryana in a bowling championship and c k nayudu cricket tournament surely helped me get selected
6218805 the basic qualities we look for are leadership integrity awareness relevant work experience some affiliation with the congress communication skills and academics but a special skill that will enable the individual to grow and also help the party is always welcome for example one of the candidates is a web designer as far as communication skills are concerned the thrust is not on fluency of language as much as it is on articulation and an ability to strike a rapport with the target audience the potential leader is seeking to represent
6218806 earlier people like me would have never got a chance to rise in politics regional politicians always promote their own family members my father works as a clerk and i come from a small village in kangra i was a popular dancer and in college i also honed my public speaking skills since i was popular i was asked to organise a hunger strike to get a school built in my village i was successful in getting a school for the village and this impressed the panel
6218807 a half assed peace sign is all i can give
6218808 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6218809 i empowered myself by not staying in the thing with russell i felt it was going to be repeating some similar patterns that id just gotten out of and it was a drag because i was crazy about him
6218810 but i did not leave my marriage for him i left because it was not working
6218811 a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please his flesh from the flesh will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life

6218813 because dammit bitch if i get paid live a good life and take care of my family and am always there for my friends why do i need to act societys version of a certain age i have nothing agaist jews or wicken or chicken
6218814 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6218815 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings the idea of sailing to gaza is kind of crazy but its also very straight forward the whole idea of having just one palestinian whos been forced off their land and who is able to return to palestine this is something that could demolish the whole zionist venture and it just has to be one person if one person can do it then others can do it this project this boat is about giving people the freedom to take responsibility you shouldnt expect something from others if you cant do it yourself and this is true both on a very personal but also on a political level
6218816 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies
6218817 im 64 years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
6218818 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do but i realized that we can change things in small ways and we have a responsibility to do this
6218819 you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone

6218829 the volume claims to be not just another diet book and a look at the twisted conspiracy thats making our country fat the books marketing says it will focus on what many call proportion distortion how our plates and average serving sizes have increased over the past few decades to secretly forge a nation of fatties this idea and the motivation to stop the dinnerware expanding insanity seems to stand in sharp contrast to the agenda pushed by crispin porter amp bogusky on behalf of some of its clients

6218849 we thought wouldnt it be fantastic if there was a world class chamber music festival here
6218850 the audience could tell us to play faster more aggressive more tragic we wanted the audience to have the opportunity to experience what we do every day
6218851 we are known for big bold and confident performances that arent shy and are substantial in sound and temperament
6218852 i guess being in a chamber group is really like having a conversation

6218855 she speaks many languages it must be an embarrassment for the wives of other heads of state to see this beautiful creature who can wear anything and speak like that
6218856 what i wanted was to be free independent of my parents
6218857 modeling is a fast acting job right away you get to work and you learn in two or three months by working
6218858 i think it is a major duty for a woman to be independent
6218859 she was full of life and wit she was beyond polite
6218860 so many like linda and christy had periods of being moody and difficult she was always perfect
6218861 shes clever super well educated and very focused she is like the heroine of a book or a movie
6218862 sometimes the desire the passion makes you fight but when that goes completely you have only the good part of it
6218863 i was really surprised by him by his youth his energy his physical charm which you could not actually see so much on television his charisma i was surprised by everything his poise and what he said and the way he said it
6218864 i think monogamy is not an idea its a fact
6218865 she makes the president more desirable more modern france needs modernity talent cleverness its like jack and jackie like rainier and grace kelly a new worldwide couple
6218866 she was so young and modern and of course unconsciously i would project myself more like jackie kennedy than for instance madame de gaulle who would be much more like the classical french woman behind her husband
6218867 id love to have children with nicolas i hope to if i am young enough it would be a dream

6218878 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6218879 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6218880 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6218881 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6218882 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6218883 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6218884 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6218885 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6218913 india is undergoing outright warfare with its cities bombed at will and massive infiltration across its borders the pakistani rationale for cutting india down to size has rarely faltered since 1947 and echoes a much older islamic tradition
6218914 within india some mosques and madrasas are the fifth column that provides critical support for the aggression that it is encountering their role is to cultivate passive and active support for the islamic onslaught it entails ensuring that most muslims refuse to co operate in efforts to interdict islamic terrorists by remaining silent spectators while the murderous bombings continue provide safe havens in impenetrable muslim areas for terrorists and a vital element of local manpower to the pakistani and saudi agencies engaged in terrorist activities
6218915 the first major indian city likely to come under the total sway of islam is kolkata since its demographics are changing rapidly with whole areas being abandoned by hindus and becoming no go muslim areas bangladesh which is contemptuous of hindu india as a pushover denies the very notion of infiltration because its muslims never accepted the legitimacy of the partition settlement they believe that the assam west bengal that jinnah originally demanded should and will belong to the islamic republic of bangladesh and if bangladesh is able to frighten hindu india there is little hope for it in the face of enhanced joint saudi pak subversion that evidence of each indian retreat is already encouraging

6218955 although the accg itself is a 501 c 4 organization that uses its contributions for political lobbying it consistently accuses and criticizes archaeological professional groups such as the aia american research centers abroad such as caari and advocacy groups such as safe for what it calls political lobbying and manipulation of course the irony in this is that all of these are 501 c 3 organizations which could not pay for political lobbying with the same freedom that the accg can
6218956 if the aia sent a squad of radical archaeologists to your house to seize your collection in the process verbally abusing you as a moral cripple responsible for everything bad that is happening to archaeological sites wouldnt you be mad as hades wouldnt you be ready to fight well get ready to fight because that is more or less what they intend to do and actually are doing one small step at a time

6218970 this scheme has properly been described as pseudo medical to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for recruiting and spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6218971 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud

6218976 the only way to resolve this is by negotiation and once again i would urge the unions to meet us and to jointly reach a solution
6218977 we have always been willing to talk that willingness remains the same
6218978 it is for the unions and local authorities to resolve this dispute and avoid further disruption to public services
6218979 that can only be done through negotiation and we are encouraging both sides to get round the table to reach agreement
6218980 on the one hand you hear local authorities saying they do not have enough money to increase the offer while the government is saying they have never had it so good

6218983 after seven weeks of the summer break when you call in favours from relatives and split your holidays with your husband to try and provide childcare coping with an extra day off is very disruptive

6219127 all the investigators and firefighters the paramedics many of us have children of our own so when you see something like this occur that was a defenseless child it really strikes deep

6219129 we have dogs of our own always have we raised three boys of our own and we have our grandchildren and i cant imagine this happening to one of our children

6219141 the simple truth is that i had to rule based on what was presented to me during that hearing and i took everything into consideration and felt a bond was appropriate
6219142 for a judge to delay jail is highly unusual but its especially unusual when you have someone convicted of a serious crime like sexual molestation of a child
6219143 one of the concerns is that you have someone who commits a sex offense who by their employment seeks to be around children they have abused that trust between a student and teacher
6219144 this was one of the most disturbing cases ive ever worked on and theres no doubt in my mind that aaron mohanlal is a dangerous person
6219145 i called the state attorneys office to see if it was some kind of mistake i dont see what would stop him from doing this to other kids
6219146 we are confident that he is doing what hes supposed to be doing
6219147 this guy has all the reason in the world to take off

6219182 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give
6219183 if tithing was a hoax that this church has been embracing what else is there that might be erroneous about this church and the churches like it
6219184 my conscience and religion forbid this treatment but since i dont want to be disciplined or sued ill do it
6219185 i am going to refer you to another doctor who is accepting new patients as my religious and moral beliefs are making it difficult for me to treat you with the respect compassion and level of care you deserve

6219196 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe
6219197 good men who are truly born again possessing a heart for gods people to be blessed and obedient and still preach tithing not necessarily out of greed as the vast majority of ministers in the christian world but out of simple ignorance or as their long life
6219198 if you tithe then you shall see gods blessings pour out from the windows of heaven that you would not have any room to contain them and curses in your life such as sickness prone to accidents bad reoccurring events etc will repel from you
6219199 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus

6219213 i hadnt heard anything about her until i found out about the script and then i researched her
6219214 it wasnt a situation where he had to really convince her
6219215 it was something that she and her uncle did just toss the football around and he thought she was good and he asked if she wanted to do it and she was like cool why not she always was like athletic and stuff
6219216 i still dont watch em but i love playing football
6219217 i would love to be a model or meet tyra banks or do modeling shoots and stuff
6219218 thats one of the reasons why i want to do these kinds of films is because theyre so inspirational to young kids and when i see how the kids react to me or the movies that i make it makes me feel so happy inside
6219219 i want to be a role model to them some girls or boys dont have role models that they can look up to in their own home or around them and i want to be that person if they dont
6219220 theyre able to do all these things and it just puts that idea in my mind where if they can do it then i definitely can do it
6219221 before i was not into it and i didnt really care
6219222 but now im very much into writing and its a lot easier for me to do i guess maybe just because being a teen ager i have a lot on my mind
6219223 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
6219224 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
6219225 he just has this personality that completely shines through everything
6219226 when people tried to talk me out of this i had a simple answer
6219227 this man in a wheelchair has had everything against him and he never had had one day of depression he never complains oh poor me or why me he just has a fabulous way of living life to the fullest he has more heart and soul than anyone ive ever met he is spiritually emotionally and mentally healthy ive had the physical ill take those other three thank you the way i see it hes healing me

6219229 i was every kind of geek and one of the geeks that i was was a band geek
6219230 a modern classic about a little girl who wants to join the high school football team
6219231 i gotta move with the acting thing because thats panning out
6219232 ive always been in supporting roles kind of reacting to other people and my character fish the heavy metal drummer hes got to drive the film its his energy and his wants and needs and desires that are the motor that push through the film and that definitely took some getting used to
6219233 fun things to do behind the kit to pump up the crowd and put on a show
6219234 theres so many disconnects in hollywood movies even in almost famous as great a movie as that is the music kind of sucks i mean who remembers fever dog as a song
6219235 you got to believe that this kid is writing these songs and can sing and play them he just looks so natural with a guitar slung over him and its such a great voice and you can tell that its his voice singing not some studio musicians voice
6219236 i got to hang out with him he was a great guy he has a really great sense of humor and a great sense of peace about the whole thing he is the original booted drummer and i guess the spark for the idea of the movie
6219237 ive waited on about a billion tables in my lifetime catered about a million catered events but i also had office jobs
6219238 what it gives you especially shakespeare and other classic texts is the importance of language and how to use it the importance of making strong choices about the character and about where they begin and where they end and the use of physicality to support the character and the language
6219239 people are really digging this movie i dont know about reviewers its not like the most original movie in the world i guess but its such a feel good fun old fashioned romp and audiences go crazy for it i think also movies nowadays are very r rated and dark the rocker kind of feels like a john hughes movie a fun for the whole family kind of rock comedy

6219314 masons guide for daily living in it masonry is a search after light
6219315 every masonic lodge is a temple of religion and its teachings are instruction in religion masonry like all religions all the mysteries hermeticism and alchemy conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it the truth must be kept secret and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason every mans conception of god must be proportioned to his mental cultivation and intellectual powers and moral excellence god is as man conceives him the reflected image of man himself
6219316 the true name of satan the kabalists say is that of yahveh reversed for satan is not a black god lucifer the light bearer strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness lucifer the son of the morning is it he who bears the light doubt it not
6219317 the blue degrees are but the outer court or portico of the temple part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations it is not intended that he shall understand them but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them their true explication is reserved for the adepts the princes of masonry it is well enough for the mass of those called masons to imagine that all is contained in the blue degrees and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain
6219318 with tongue and pen with all our open and secret influences with the purse and if need be with the sword
6219319 we must allow all of the federations to continue just as they are with their systems their central authorities and diverse modes of correspondence between high grades of the same rite organized as they are at present but we must create a super rite which will remain unknown to which we will call those masons of high degree whom we shall select with regard to our brothers in masonry these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy through this supreme rite we will govern all freemasonry which will become the one international center the more powerful because its direction will be unknown
6219320 the first world war must be brought about in order to permit the illuminati to overthrow the power of the czars in russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic communism
6219321 the second world war must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascists and the political zionists this war must be brought about so that nazism is destroyed and that the political zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of israel in palestine during the second world war international communism must become strong enough in order to balance christendom which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm

6219332 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6219333 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6219334 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6219335 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6219336 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6219337 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6219338 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 percent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction

6219348 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6219349 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6219350 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6219351 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
6219352 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist

6219858 es behindert uns aber auch nicht in unser strategischen handlungsf higkeit
6219859 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6219860 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6219861 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6219862 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6219863 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6219864 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6219865 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6219866 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6219867 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6219868 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6219869 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6219870 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6219871 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6219872 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6219873 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6219874 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6219875 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6219876 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
6219877 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
6219878 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
6219879 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
6219880 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
6219881 datti allippica visto ke oltre a fare danza nn 6 buona a niente

6219888 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6219889 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6219890 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6219891 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6219892 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6219893 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6219894 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6219895 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6219896 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6219897 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6219898 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6219899 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6219900 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6219901 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages

6219905 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6219906 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6219907 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6219908 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6219909 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6219910 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6219911 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown

6219934 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6219935 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6219936 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6219937 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6219938 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

6219949 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6219950 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less

6219952 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6219953 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources

6219958 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6219959 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6219960 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6219963 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6219964 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6219968 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6219969 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6219970 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6219971 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6219972 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
